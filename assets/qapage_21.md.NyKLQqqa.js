Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard protocols. The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers. The original version of the model defined seven layers.\\r\\nA layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that comprise the contents of that path. Two instances at the same layer are visualized as connected by a horizontal connection in that layer.\\r\\nThe model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), maintained by the identification ISO/IEC 7498-1.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1970s, one project was administered by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), while another was undertaken by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee, or CCITT (the abbreviation is from the French version of the name). These two international standards bodies each developed a document that defined similar networking models.\\r\\nIn 1983, these two documents were merged to form a standard called The Basic Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection. The standard is usually referred to as the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model, the OSI Reference Model, or simply the OSI model. It was published in 1984 by both the ISO, as standard ISO 7498, and the renamed CCITT (now called the Telecommunications Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union or ITU-T) as standard X.200.\\r\\nOSI had two major components, an abstract model of networking, called the Basic Reference Model or seven-layer model, and a set of specific protocols.\\r\\nThe concept of a seven-layer model was provided by the work of Charles Bachman at Honeywell Information Services. Various aspects of OSI design evolved from experiences with the ARPANET, NPLNET, EIN, CYCLADES network and the work in IFIP WG6.1. The new design was documented in ISO 7498 and its various addenda. In this model, a networking system was divided into layers. Within each layer, one or more entities implement its functionality. Each entity interacted directly only with the layer immediately beneath it, and provided facilities for use by the layer above it.\\r\\nProtocols enable an entity in one host to interact with a corresponding entity at the same layer in another host. Service definitions abstractly described the functionality provided to an (N)-layer by an (N-1) layer, where N was one of the seven layers of protocols operating in the local host.\\r\\nThe OSI standards documents are available from the ITU-T as the X.200-series of recommendations.[1] Some of the protocol specifications were also available as part of the ITU-T X series. The equivalent ISO and ISO/IEC standards for the OSI model were available from ISO. Not all are free of charge.[2]\\r\\nThe recommendation X.200 describes seven layers, labeled 1 to 7. Layer 1 is the lowest layer in this model.\\r\\nAt each level N, two entities at the communicating devices (layer N peers) exchange protocol data units (PDUs) by means of a layer N protocol. Each PDU contains a payload, called the service data unit (SDU), along with protocol-related headers or footers.\\r\\nData processing by two communicating OSI-compatible devices is done as such:\\r\\nSome orthogonal aspects, such as management and security, involve all of the layers (See ITU-T X.800 Recommendation[4]). These services are aimed at improving the CIA triad - confidentiality, integrity, and availability - of the transmitted data. In practice, the availability of a communication service is determined by the interaction between network design and network management protocols. Appropriate choices for both of these are needed to protect against denial of service.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe physical layer defines the electrical and physical specifications of the data connection. It defines the relationship between a device and a physical transmission medium (for example, an electrical cable, an optical fiber cable, or a radio frequency link). This includes the layout of pins, voltages, line impedance, cable specifications, signal timing and similar characteristics for connected devices and frequency (5?GHz or 2.4?GHz etc.) for wireless devices. It is responsible for transmission and reception of unstructured raw data in a physical medium. Bit rate control is done at the physical layer. It may define transmission mode as simplex, half duplex, and full duplex. It defines the network topology as bus, mesh, or ring being some of the most common.\\r\\nThe physical layer of Parallel SCSI operates in this layer, as do the physical layers of Ethernet and other local-area networks, such as token ring, FDDI, ITU-T G.hn, and IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), as well as personal area networks such as Bluetooth and IEEE 802.15.4.\\r\\nThe physical layer is the layer of low-level networking equipment, such as some hubs, cabling, and repeaters. The physical layer is never concerned with protocols or other such higher-layer items. Examples of hardware in this layer are network adapters, repeaters, network hubs, modems, and fiber media converters.\\r\\nThe data link layer provides node-to-node data transfera link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.\\r\\nIEEE 802 divides the data link layer into two sublayers:[5]\\r\\nThe MAC and LLC layers of IEEE 802 networks such as 802.3 Ethernet, 802.11 Wi-Fi, and 802.15.4 ZigBee operate at the data link layer.\\r\\nThe Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link layer protocol that can operate over several different physical layers, such as synchronous and asynchronous serial lines.\\r\\nThe ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over existing wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables), includes a complete data link layer that provides both error correction and flow control by means of a selective-repeat sliding-window protocol.\\r\\nThe network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences (called datagrams) from one node to another connected in \\"different networks\\". A network is a medium to which many nodes can be connected, on which every node has an address and which permits nodes connected to it to transfer messages to other nodes connected to it by merely providing the content of a message and the address of the destination node and letting the network find the way to deliver the message to the destination node, possibly routing it through intermediate nodes. If the message is too large to be transmitted from one node to another on the data link layer between those nodes, the network may implement message delivery by splitting the message into several fragments at one node, sending the fragments independently, and reassembling the fragments at another node. It may, but does not need to, report delivery errors.\\r\\nMessage delivery at the network layer is not necessarily guaranteed to be reliable; a network layer protocol may provide reliable message delivery, but it need not do so.\\r\\nA number of layer-management protocols, a function defined in the management annex, ISO 7498/4, belong to the network layer. These include routing protocols, multicast group management, network-layer information and error, and network-layer address assignment. It is the function of the payload that makes these belong to the network layer, not the protocol that carries them.[6]\\r\\nThe transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host via one or more networks, while maintaining the quality of service functions.\\r\\nAn example of a transport-layer protocol in the standard Internet stack is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), usually built on top of the Internet Protocol (IP).\\r\\nThe transport layer controls the reliability of a given link through flow control, segmentation/desegmentation, and error control. Some protocols are state- and connection-oriented. This means that the transport layer can keep track of the segments and re-transmit those that fail. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and sends the next data if no errors occurred. The transport layer creates packets out of the message received from the application layer. Packetizing is a process of dividing the long message into smaller messages.\\r\\nOSI defines five classes of connection-mode transport protocols ranging from class 0 (which is also known as TP0 and provides the fewest features) to class 4 (TP4, designed for less reliable networks, similar to the Internet). Class 0 contains no error recovery, and was designed for use on network layers that provide error-free connections. Class 4 is closest to TCP, although TCP contains functions, such as the graceful close, which OSI assigns to the session layer. Also, all OSI TP connection-mode protocol classes provide expedited data and preservation of record boundaries. Detailed characteristics of TP0-4 classes are shown in the following table:[7]\\r\\nAn easy way to visualize the transport layer is to compare it with a post office, which deals with the dispatch and classification of mail and parcels sent. Do remember, however, that a post office manages the outer envelope of mail. Higher layers may have the equivalent of double envelopes, such as cryptographic presentation services that can be read by the addressee only. Roughly speaking, tunneling protocols operate at the transport layer, such as carrying non-IP protocols such as IBM's SNA or Novell's IPX over an IP network, or end-to-end encryption with IPsec. While Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) might seem to be a network-layer protocol, if the encapsulation of the payload takes place only at endpoint, GRE becomes closer to a transport protocol that uses IP headers but contains complete frames or packets to deliver to an endpoint. L2TP carries PPP frames inside transport packet.\\r\\nAlthough not developed under the OSI Reference Model and not strictly conforming to the OSI definition of the transport layer, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) of the Internet Protocol Suite are commonly categorized as layer-4 protocols within OSI.\\r\\nThe session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. It provides for full-duplex, half-duplex, or simplex operation, and establishes checkpointing, adjournment, termination, and restart procedures. The OSI model made this layer responsible for graceful close of sessions, which is a property of the Transmission Control Protocol, and also for session checkpointing and recovery, which is not usually used in the Internet Protocol Suite. The session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls.\\r\\nThe presentation layer establishes context between application-layer entities, in which the application-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics if the presentation service provides a mapping between them. If a mapping is available, presentation service data units are encapsulated into session protocol data units and passed down the protocol stack.\\r\\nThis layer provides independence from data representation by translating between application and network formats. The presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application accepts. This layer formats data to be sent across a network. It is sometimes called the syntax layer.[8] A common myth is that the Presentation Layer does compression and encryption. This is simply not true.[citation needed] The Presentation Layer negotiates the Transfer Syntax.\\r\\nThe original presentation structure used the Basic Encoding Rules of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), with capabilities such as converting an EBCDIC-coded text file to an ASCII-coded file, or serialization of objects and other data structures from and to XML. ASN.1 effectively makes an application protocol invariant with respect to syntax.\\r\\nThe application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. This layer interacts with software applications that implement a communicating component. Such application programs fall outside the scope of the OSI model. Application-layer functions typically include identifying communication partners, determining resource availability, and synchronizing communication. When identifying communication partners, the application layer determines the identity and availability of communication partners for an application with data to transmit. The most important distinction in the application layer is the distinction between the application-entity and the application. For example, a reservation website might have two application-entities: one using HTTP to communicate with its users, and one for a remote database protocol to record reservations. Neither of these protocols have anything to do with reservations. That logic is in the application itself. The application layer per se has no means to determine the availability of resources in the network.\\r\\nCross-layer functions are services that are not tied to a given layer, but may affect more than one layer. Examples include the following:\\r\\nNeither the OSI Reference Model nor OSI protocols specify any programming interfaces, other than deliberately abstract service specifications. Protocol specifications precisely define the interfaces between different computers, but the software interfaces inside computers, known as network sockets are implementation-specific.\\r\\nFor example, Microsoft Windows' Winsock, and Unix's Berkeley sockets and System V Transport Layer Interface, are interfaces between applications (layer 5 and above) and the transport (layer 4). NDIS and ODI are interfaces between the media (layer 2) and the network protocol (layer 3).\\r\\nInterface standards, except for the physical layer to media, are approximate implementations of OSI service specifications.\\r\\nThe design of protocols in the TCP/IP model of the Internet does not concern itself with strict hierarchical encapsulation and layering.[15] RFC 3439 contains a section entitled \\"Layering considered harmful\\".[16] TCP/IP does recognize four broad layers of functionality which are derived from the operating scope of their contained protocols: the scope of the software application; the end-to-end transport connection; the internetworking range; and the scope of the direct links to other nodes on the local network.[17]\\r\\nDespite using a different concept for layering than the OSI model, these layers are often compared with the OSI layering scheme in the following way:\\r\\nThese comparisons are based on the original seven-layer protocol model as defined in ISO 7498, rather than refinements in such things as the internal organization of the network layer document.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe presumably strict layering of the OSI model as it is usually described does not present contradictions in TCP/IP, as it is permissible that protocol usage does not follow the hierarchy implied in a layered model. Such examples exist in some routing protocols (for example OSPF), or in the description of tunneling protocols, which provide a link layer for an application, although the tunnel host protocol might well be a transport or even an application-layer protocol in its own right.[citation needed]","field3":"How many layers are there in osi model?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Kuwait","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"","field3":"Who was involved in the gulf war 1991?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Diane Guerrero","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Diane Guerrero (born July 21, 1986)[1][2] is an American actress and author.

Then she attended Boston Arts Academy, a performing arts high school, where she was in the music department.[5] Among her high school activities was singing with a jazz group, but she anticipated pursuing political science and communications in college.[5] In 2010, she appeared in the Faces music video that was shot in Norwood, Massachusetts for Louie Bello.[6] Her first job after college was in a law office.[5] At age 24, she decided to pursue a career in acting.[7] In 2011, she moved to New York City and studied acting at the Susan Batson Studios where she met her manager Josh Taylor.[5] Guerrero's life experience compels her to advocate for immigration reform and is an influence that she draws upon in her acting.[8][9]\\r\\nShe auditioned for a role on Devious Maids, but was cast in Orange is the New Black, where she plays a Bronx-bred character that she feels is likely Puerto Rican.[5] For season 2, she was part of the cast that earned recognition for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards.[10][11] The cast earned recognition for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series again at the 22nd Screen Actors Guild Awards and 23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards.[12][13] She has had a recurring role on Are We There Yet?.\\r\\nIn 2014, she appeared in Emoticon?;), a comedy about a MayÿDecember romance in which her character's father is involved with a doctoral candidate.[14] Her performance in this film as Amanda (\\"Mandy\\") Nevins, an adopted teenage child, elicited positive criticism such as a description of a \\"well-drawn smaller moment\\" that was \\"beautifully rendered\\" according to Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter and a performance that \\"command sympathy\\" according to Inkoo Kang of the Los Angeles Times.[15][16]\\r\\nOne of her upcoming roles is as an 1800s Cuban confederate spy, loosely based on the life of Loreta Janeta Velazquez, for Peter and John.[5] She was cast in The CW's series Jane the Virgin in a recurring role.[17][18] In February 2015, Guerrero was cast as the female lead in CBS' television pilot for Super Clyde,[19] but the show was not picked up for series when CBS announced its fall schedule in May.[20] Guerrero has upcoming film roles in Happy Yummy Chicken, Beyond Control and The Godmother.[21]\\r\\nIn 2016, Guerrero released In the Country We Love: My Family Divided a memoir about her parents being detained and deported when she was fourteen. The book's written with Michelle Burford and published by Henry Holt and Co.[22][23]\\r\\nGuerrero was the lead in a CBS drama under development for the 2017ÿ18 United States network television season based on and sharing the title of her memoir, In the Country We Love. Guerrero will portray a successful corporate attorney who takes on pro bono cases for undocumented immigrants after her own past as the child of deported parents is revealed by a family emergency.[24] Guerrero was cast in a regular role for season 2 of Superior Donuts.[25]","field3":"Orange is the new black puerto rican actress?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"12,222","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Santa Fe (English: Holy Faith) is a city in Galveston County, Texas. It is named for the Santa Fe Railroad (now part of BNSF Railway) which runs through the town alongside State Highway 6. The population of Santa Fe at the 2010 census was 12,222.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1877, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway was built through the western part of Galveston county.[4]  By the turn of the century, three small, unincorporated towns had formed along the railway: Alta Loma, Arcadia and Algoa.  The Santa Fe Independent School District, named after the railway, was established shortly afterward to serve the area. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-1970s, the neighboring city of Hitchcock attempted to annex the Morningview neighborhood in eastern Alta Loma, to which the neighborhood residents were opposed. To avoid annexation, a petitioning effort was begun to incorporate the area into a new city.  On January 21, 1978, a ballot proposal to incorporate Alta Loma and parts of Arcadia (a total of nine square miles) passed by a wide margin, and the city of Santa Fe was born. In the years since, Santa Fe has grown to include all of Arcadia and parts of Algoa, and has become an affluent area of Galveston County.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 14, 1981, the Ku Klux Klan hosted a fish fry on a private farm in Santa Fe to protest the growing presence of Vietnamese shrimpers in the Gulf.  During the event, a Vietnamese fishing boat was ceremonially burned.[5][6]  That controversy, as well as similar conflicts in nearby port towns like Rockport, led to a decision of the United States District Court, S.D.Texas, Houston Division[7] Vietnamese Fishermen's Association v. Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,[8] and also served as the basis for the 1985 Ed Harris film Alamo Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 19, 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the Santa Fe Independent School District's policy of permitting \\"student-led, student-initiated\\" prayer at football games and other school events violated the Constitution's prohibitions against the establishment of state religion.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning of May 18, 2018, a 17 year old student opened fire at Santa Fe High School, killing ten students and faculty and injuring thirteen others. Students and faculty evacuated the building when a fire alarm was activated.

Bruce Library at 13302 6th Street.[18] The Santa Fe Community Library opened inside a former World War II army barracks in 1975. By 2011 the barracks became overwhelmed by the library's increasing size. A group of residents established a building committee and, with Moody Foundation and Kempner Fund grants and donations from the community, purchased a 1,920-square-foot (178?m2) metal portable building on land leased from the Santa Fe Independent School District. The portable was across Highway 6 from the barracks. After continuing growth of the library, in 1987 Mae S. Bruce presented a 6,400-square-foot (590?m2) brick structure to the city. The library moved to the structure and was renamed after Bruce.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAirports in unincorporated areas near Santa Fe include:\\r\\n\\r\\nAirports with scheduled commercial airline service for the area, located in Houston, are William P.

Because weight is directly dependent upon gravitational acceleration, things on the Moon will weigh only 16.6% of what they weigh on the Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gravitational field of the Moon has been measured by tracking the radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The principle used depends on the Doppler effect, whereby the line-of-sight spacecraft acceleration can be measured by small shifts in frequency of the radio signal, and the measurement of the distance from the spacecraft to a station on Earth. Since the gravitational field of the Moon affects the orbit of a spacecraft, one can use these tracking data to detect gravity anomalies. However, because of the Moon's synchronous rotation it is not possible to track spacecraft from Earth much beyond the limbs of the Moon, so until the recent GRAIL mission the far-side gravity field was not accurately known. \\r\\n\\r\\nA major feature of the Moon's gravitational field is the presence of mascons, which are large positive gravity anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins. These anomalies significantly influence the orbit of spacecraft around the Moon, and an accurate gravitational model is necessary in the planning of both manned and unmanned missions. They were initially discovered by the analysis of Lunar Orbiter tracking data:[2] navigation tests prior to the Apollo program showed positioning errors much larger than mission specifications.\\r\\n\\r\\nMascons are in part due to the presence of dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill some of the impact basins.[3] However, lava flows by themselves cannot fully explain the gravitational variations, and uplift of the crust-mantle interface is required as well. Based on Lunar Prospector gravitational models, it has been suggested that some mascons exist that do not show evidence for mare basaltic volcanism.[4] The huge expanse of mare basaltic volcanism associated with Oceanus Procellarum does not cause a positive gravity anomaly. The center of gravity of the Moon does not coincide exactly with its geometric center, but is displaced toward the Earth by about 2 kilometers.[5]","field3":"What is the gravity difference between earth and moon?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"twenty","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Stade Roland Garros (\\"Roland Garros Stadium\\", French pronunciation:?[stad ?ol? a??s]?(?listen)) is a tennis venue located in Paris, France, that hosts the French Openalso known as Roland Garros, particularly within Europea Grand Slam championship tournament played annually around the end of May and the beginning of June. It is named for Roland Garros, a pioneer aviator who completed the first solo flight across the Mediterranean Sea,[1] engineer (inventor of the first forward-firing aircraft machine gun),[2] and World War I hero (the first pilot to shoot down five enemy aircraft and to be called an \\"ace\\" for doing so).[3] Garros was killed in aerial combat in 1918. The facility was constructed in 1928 to host France's first defense of the Davis Cup.\\r\\nThe 21-acre (8.5-hectare) complex contains twenty courts,[4] including three large-capacity stadiums; Les Jardins de Roland Garros, a large restaurant and bar complex;[5] Le Village, the press and VIP area; France's National Training Centre (CNE); and the Tenniseum, a bilingual, multimedia museum of the history of tennis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance was an important power in tennis during the first half of the 20th century due to the dominance of Suzanne Lenglen during the 1910s and 1920s, and les Quatre Mousquetaires (\\"the Four Musketeers\\")Jacques \\"Toto\\" Brugnon, Jean Borotra (the \\"Bouncing Basque\\"), Henri Cochet (the \\"Magician\\"), and Ren Lacoste (the \\"Crocodile\\")in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1927, France defeated the United States to win the Davis Cup, due largely to the Musketeers' efforts. Roland Garros was constructed as a venue for France's successful defense the following year.[6] France retained the Cup until 1933, again largely because of the Musketeers. A monument to France's six Cup championships stands at the center of Place des Mousquetaires, a circular courtyard near the venue's entrance.[7]\\r\\nIn October 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, the facility was used as a detention centre where \\"indsirables\\"mostly Hungarians, Russians, Italians, Poles, and citizens suspected of being communistswere held pending imprisonment.[8] Journalist and former communist Arthur Koestler reported that at the time of his detention, posters advertising the last match prior to the outbreak of war, between Cochet and Borotra, were still in place.[9]\\r\\nWhile the Roland Garros surface is invariably characterized as \\"red clay\\", the courts are in fact surfaced with white limestone covered with a few millimeters of powdered red brick dust. Beneath the 3-inch (7.6?cm) layer of porous limestone is 6 inches (15?cm) of volcanic rock, followed by a 3-foot (0.91?m) layer of sand, all of which rests on a slab of concrete. Crushed brick is pressed onto the limestone surface with rollers, then drenched in water. The process is repeated several times until a thin, compact layer coats each court. The crushed brick is deep enough to allow footprints and ball marks, but shallow enough to avoid making the court spongy or slippery. In tournament situations workers smooth the surface before matches and between sets by dragging rectangular lengths of chain-link across it. The red brick dust is replenished as needed (daily during major tournaments).[10]\\r\\nThe surface was a state-of-the art solution, in 1928, to the biggest problem with natural clay courts: poor drainage. At the time it was not unusual for clay surfaces to be unplayable for two to three days after even short periods of precipitation. The limestone/crushed brick combination, originally developed in Britain, played and looked similar to clay without clay's drainage issues, thus rendering natural clay obsolete as a tennis court surface.[11] Since then a multitude of other \\"fast-dry\\" and synthetic clay surfaces have been developed. Courts surfaced with these materials play much like natural clay surfaces and are collectively classified as \\"clay courts\\", despite the fact that few if any true clay courts have been built for almost a century. The diversity in composition of various \\"clay\\" surfaces around the world explains the extraordinary variability in their playing characteristics. All clay courts are different, Venus Williams has said. None play the same. [Roland Garros] plays the best.[10]\\r\\nCourt Philippe Chatrier was built in 1928 as Roland Garros's centerpiece and remains its principal venue, seating 14,840 spectators (reduced from 15,166 in 2010 to accommodate new press boxes).[12][13] The stadium was known simply as \\"Court Central\\" until 2001, when it was renamed for the long-time president of the Fdration Fran?aise de Tennis (FFT) who helped restore tennis as a Summer Olympics sport in 1988.[14]\\r\\nThe four main spectator grandstands are named for les Quatre MousquetairesBrugnon, Borotra, Cochet, and Lacostein honor of their Davis Cup success, which prompted construction of the facility, and the stadium.[6] As a further tribute, the trophy awarded each year to the French Open men's singles champion is known as La Coupe des Mousquetaires.[7]\\r\\nBuilt in 1994 and originally designated \\"Court A\\", Court Suzanne Lenglen is the secondary stadium with a capacity of 10,068 spectators.[15] Its namesake, an international celebrity and the first true star of women's tennis, won 31 major tournaments, including six French Open titles and six Wimbledon championships, between 1914 and 1926. Known as La Divine (\\"Divine One\\") and La Grand Dame (\\"Great Lady\\") of French tennis, she also won two Olympic gold medals in Antwerp in 1920. A bronze bas relief of Lenglen by the Italian sculptor Vito Tongiani stands over the east tunnel-entrance to the stadium. The trophy awarded each year to the French Open women's singles champion is named La Coupe Suzanne Lenglen in her honor. The court has an underground irrigation system, the first of its kind, to control moisture levels within its surface.[7]\\r\\nIn 1994, the walkway between Court Chatrier and Court Lenglen was named Alle Marcel Bernard, in honor of the 1940s-era French champion who died that year.[7]\\r\\nNicknamed the \\"Bullring\\" because of its circular shape, Court 1 is the facility's tertiary venue. Its architect, Jean Lovera, a former French junior champion, designed the 3,800-seat structure as a deliberate contrast to the adjacent, angular Court Philippe Chatrier. Built in 1980, the Bullring is a favorite among serious tennis fans because of its relatively small size and feeling of close proximity to the action.[16] An unusual design feature is its press seating in the first row at court level behind the south baseline.[17]\\r\\nCourt 1 has been the scene of several stunning French Open upsets, such as unseeded Gustavo Kuerten's 3rd-round victory over fifth-seeded former champion Thomas Muster in 1997, on his way to his first of three Open titles;[18] and third-seeded Gabriela Sabatini's defeatafter a 6-1, 5-1 lead and five match pointsto Mary Joe Fernandez, the fifth seed, in the 1993 quarterfinals.[19] It was also the site of Marat Safin's famous \\"dropped pants\\" match against Flix Mantilla in 2004.[20]\\r\\nKnown officially as the Museum of the French Federation of Tennis, the Tenniseum was designed by the French architect Bruno Moinard and opened in May 2003. It is housed in a former groundsman's cottage, and comprises a multimedia center, media library, and permanent and temporary exhibits dedicated to the history of tennis in general, and the French Open in particular. Permanent exhibits include a display of the French Open perpetual trophies, including La Coupe des Mousquetaires and La Coupe Suzanne Lenglen; a narrative and photographic history of Roland Garros; displays documenting the evolution of tennis attire through the years; a comprehensive collection of tennis racquets dating back to the mid-19th century; and a large exhibition of tennis-related photographs and paintings. The media library houses a diverse collection of documents, posters, books, and magazines, as well as a database of tennis information, statistics, trivia, and match summaries of all French Open tournament matches since 1928. The bilingual (French/English) multimedia center contains over 4,000 hours of digitized video including documentaries, interviews with many of the sport's legendary players, and film archives dating from 1897 to the present. Tours are conducted daily. (Two per day, at 11:00am and 3:00pm, are in English.) During the French Open the normal entry fee is waived for tournament ticket-holders.[21]\\r\\nIn 2009 the Fdration Fran?aise de Tennis (FFT) announced that it had commissioned the French architect Marc Mimram (designer of the Passerelle des Deux Rives footbridge across the Rhine River in Strasbourg[22]) to design a significant expansion of Stade Roland Garros. On the current property, the proposal called for the addition of lights and a retractable roof over Court Philippe Chatrier. At the nearby Georges Hbert municipal recreation area, east of Roland Garros at Porte d'Auteuil, a fourth stadium will be built with a retractable roof and 14,600 seating capacity, along with two smaller show courts with seating for 1,500 and 750.[23]\\r\\nIn 2010, faced with opposition to the proposed expansion from factions within the Paris City Council, the FFT announced that it was considering an alternate plan to move the French Open to a new, 55-court venue outside of Paris city limits. The three sites reportedly under consideration were Marne-la-Valle (site of the Euro Disney resort), the northern Paris suburb of Gonesse near Charles de Gaulle Airport, and a vacant army base near Versailles.[24] Amid charges of bluffing and brinkmanship, a spokesman explained that because Roland Garros is less than half the size of the other three Grand Slam venues and has no covered courts, the French Open was at risk of losing its Grand Slam status to Madridwhich has a long clay court tradition and larger facilitiesor the Gulf countries, \\"who were ready to offer some crazy prize money\\".[25] As a result, he said, the FFT was left with only two viable options: expansion of Roland Garros or relocation of the event.[26]\\r\\nIn February 2011, the FFT voted to keep the tournament at Roland Garros, citing the prohibitive expense ($630 million to $1 billion) of building a new venue from scratch versus a projected $370 million to carry out the proposed expansion.[27] Further details of the plan were announced in May 2013, including a complete rebuild of the Chatrier court on its existing foundations in addition to the new roof and lights, and a larger Place des Mousquetaires in the area now occupied by Court 1. The new stadium at Porte d'Auteuil would be built below ground level, with greenhouses surrounding it on all four sides. Project deadlines were pushed back from 2016 to 2018. Local residents, wildlife enthusiasts and municipal authorities continued to voice opposition to the plan, which would increase the Roland Garros grounds from 21 acres (8.5 hectares) to about 33.8 acres (13.5 hectares).[28]\\r\\nIn February 2015, the renovation encountered another obstacle when the Ministry of Ecology issued a negative report, and the project was placed on hold in March pending completion of a new land use study for the City Council.[29][30] In June, shortly after conclusion of the 2015 French Open, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced that construction permits had been signed, with a new cost estimate of $450 million and completion further delayed to 2019.[31] Opponents, who objected to the demolition of 2.5 acres (1 hectare) of greenhouses and biological gardens within Porte d'Auteuil on the eastern border of the current facility,[32] proposed an alternate, northward expansion into the Bois de Boulogne that would require covering a portion of the A13 highway.[33][34] Proponents of the eastward expansion argued that further delays would jeopardize Paris's bid for the 2024 Olympic games.[35]\\r\\nIn December 2015, the Paris Administrative Court ordered suspension of reclamation work involving the Auteuil botanical garden greenhouses. In a statement, the FFT responded that the greenhouses would not be destroyed, and would, in fact, be \\"embellished\\". FFT also noted that opponents of the eastward expansion \\"[did] not have good alternatives from the operational, legal and environmental point of view\\", and added that expansion into the Bois de Boulogne was \\"impossible\\".[36]\\r\\nIn February 2017, the last of the legal challenges were resolved and work resumed on the original, eastward expansion plan. FFT officials announced that the new tournament organization building and Village, new courts 7 and 9, the expanded Place des Mousquetaires, and a new show court in the Fond des Princes area west of Court Lenglen are scheduled for completion in time for the 2018 Open. The Porte d'Auteuil Court des Serres (Greenhouse Court) should be ready for the 2019 tournament, and the rebuilt Court Chatrier by 2020.[25][37][38]\\r\\nRoland Garros is located at the southern boundary of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris's 16th arrondissement.

Chief Guest of this event was the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Ms Kamla Persad-Bissessar.[11]\\r\\nThe 2013 Pravasi Bhartiya Divas was held from 8ÿ9 January 2013 in Kochi, Kerala. Chief Guest of this event was the President of Mauritius, Rajkeshwar Purryag.[12] The 2015 Pravasi Bharatiya Divas was held in Ahmedabad celebrating 100 years of Mahatma's return to India. Chief guest was Mr Donald Ramtar, President of Republic of Guyana. The theme for this was \\"Apna Bharat Apna Gaurav\\" \\"Connecting Generations\\".\\r\\nPravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD), the annual event for the Indian diaspora, was canceled for 2016. The format of the event, which is held between 7 and 9 January, has been changed as announced by the minister of external affairs and overseas Indian affairs Sushma Swaraj, in October 2015. As per the announcement, the event was being moved to different states every two years; a smaller event would be held in Delhi every alternate year.\\r\\nThe 2017 (15th, being 14th cancelled) Pravasi Bharatiya Divas will be held from 7ÿ9 January 2017, in Bengaluru || Karnataka. Theme: \\"Redefining Engagement with the Indian Diaspora\\". The Ministry of External Affairs, under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been effortlessly using digital modes to reach out to Indians abroad. The campaign Digital India is also playing a major role in bringing the success to Pravasi Bhartiya Divas. The plenary session Leveraging Social Media for Diaspora Connect to be held on January 9, 2017, at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas will look at social media as a medium in connecting the Indian Diaspora.[13]\\r\\nThe annual Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Program since 2003 has been organised in the following cities:\\r\\n*The 14th PBD scheduled to be held in 2016 was cancelled.\\r\\nThe Ministry of External Affairs organizes Regional Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (RPBD) periodically outside India to connect with the Indian Diaspora in specific regions, familiarize them with the policies and programmes of the Government, enable them to contribute to Indias development and growth, and address their concerns.\\r\\n10 RPBD events have been held till date, at the following places:\\r\\nThe 10th Regional Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (RPBD) Convention was organized in Singapore at Marina Bay Sands, on 6th & 7th January 2018. This was a special RPBD to celebrate the 25 years of strategic partnership between India and ASEAN. The theme of the 2018 PBD Convention is Ancient Route, New Journey: Diaspora in the Dynamic India-ASEAN Partnership. Indian EAM Sushma Swaraj is the Guest of Honour, and Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean also attended. Indian Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari and chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Assam, N Chandrababu Naidu and Sarbananda Sonowal respectively, also attended the event. Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister S Iswaran and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan also addressed over 2,500 delegates.\\r\\nA High-Level Committee on Indian Diaspora, headed by Shri L. M. Singhvi, had recommended in January 2002 that the Government must renew and strengthen linkages of overseas Indians to their place of origin and with each other. The committee recommended that a Pravasi Bharatiya Bhavan should be set up to emerge as the focal point for networking between India and its overseas Indian community; and as a suitable place which would commemorate the trials, tribulations, the evolution, and achievements of the Indian Diaspora.Taking this recommendation forward in January 2004, at the second Pravasi Bhartiya Divas (PBD) organized in Delhi, then Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced that the Government will set up the Pravasi Bhartiya Kendra in New Delhi.The Foundation Stone of the Kendra was laid by the then P.M. Dr. Manmohan Singh at 9th PBD in January 2011. Ground Breaking was done by then Minister of Overseas Indian Affairs on 28.04.2011 and construction started in April 2013. Contract for construction of Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra (PBK) was awarded to National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) on turnkey basis.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra in New Delhi on Sunday on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti. The centre was dedicated to the welfare of the Indian Diaspora. At the inauguration, the prime minister said \\"We are inaugurating this Kendra on a significant day of 2nd October. Gandhi Ji had left India but the call of the nation brought him back.\\"[14] Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra located at the heart of the Capital in Plots No.15A, 15B and 15D, Dr. Rizal Marg, Chanakyapuri, New Delhi is a tribute to the overseas Indian community; and commemorates their migration to various parts of the world, the challenges they faced abroad, their achievements and contributions. Over time, the Kendra is expected to develop into a hub of activities for sustainable, symbiotic and mutually rewarding economic, social and cultural engagement between India and its Diaspora. Activities, seminars, events, workshops pertaining to the Indian Diaspora are expected to be organized here. The Museum in the Kendra will depict the history of migration of the overseas Indian community; their experiences and contributions. In the Kendras state-of-the art auditorium, multi-purpose halls, Conference and seminar halls ÿ workshops and conferences with overseas Indians and on issues pertaining to them would be organized on a regular basis. The Kendra will also house the autonomous bodies India Centre for Migration, a think-tank working on issues pertaining to Indian migrant workers and the India Development Foundation for Overseas Indians, a not-for-profit Trust promoting contributions to flagship programmes in India. The Library in PBK is a valuable repository of material about the Indian Diaspora including books written by overseas Indians in different languages.With an emphasis on digital material, the library will provide access to online journals and prestigious library resources[15]","field3":"Where was the pravasi bharatiya divas 2018 held?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"five pounds","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The British crown, the successor to the English crown and the Scottish dollar, came into being with the Union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland in 1707. As with the English coin, its value was five shillings.\\r\\nAlways a heavy silver coin weighing around one ounce, during the 19th and 20th centuries the crown declined from being a real means of exchange to being a coin rarely spent and minted for commemorative purposes only. In that format it has continued to be minted, even following decimalisation of the British currency in 1971. However, as the result of inflation the value of the coin was revised upwards in 1990 to five pounds.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coin's origins lay in the English silver crown, one of many silver coins that appeared in various countries from the 16th century onwards, the most famous example perhaps being the famous Spanish pieces of eight, all of which were of a similar size and weight (approx 38mm diameter and containing approx 25?grams of fine silver) and thus interchangeable in international trade.[2] The kingdom of England also minted gold Crowns in the 16th and 17th centuries.\\r\\nThe dies for all gold and silver coins of Queen Anne and King George I were engraved by John Croker, a migrant originally from Dresden in the Duchy of Saxony.[3]\\r\\nThe British crown was always a large coin, and from the 19th century it did not circulate well. However, crowns were usually struck in a new monarch's coronation year, true of each monarch since King George IV up until the present monarch in 1953, with the single exception of King George V.\\r\\nThe Queen Victoria \\"Gothic\\" crown of 1847 (with a mintage of just 8,000 and produced to celebrate the Gothic revival) is considered by many to be the most beautiful British coin ever minted[citation needed].\\r\\nThe King George V \\"wreath\\" crowns struck from 1927 through 1936 (excluding 1935 when the more common \\"rocking horse\\" crown was minted to commemorate the King's Silver Jubilee) depict a wreath on the reverse of the coin and were struck in very low numbers. Generally struck late in the year and intended to be purchased as Christmas gifts, they did not circulate well, with the rarest of all dates, 1934 (mintage just 932), now fetching several thousand pounds each. The 1927 \\"wreath\\" crowns were struck as proofs only (15,030 minted).\\r\\nWith its large size, many of the later coins were primarily commemoratives. The 1951 issue was for the Festival of Britain, and was only struck in proof condition. The 1953 crown was issued to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, while the 1960 issue (which carried the same reverse design as the previous crown in 1953) commemorated the British Exhibition in New York. The 1965 issue carried the image of Winston Churchill on the reverse, the first time a non-monarch or commoner was ever placed on a British coin, and marked his death. According to the Standard Catalogue of coins, 19,640,000 of this coin were minted, a very high number at the time, making them of little value today except as a mark of respect for the national war leader. Production of the Churchill Crown began on 11 October 1965, and stopped in the summer of 1966.\\r\\nThe crown was worth five shillings (a shilling being 12 pre-decimal pence) until decimalisation in February 1971, and was also the basis of other denominations such as the half crown and double crown.\\r\\nThe last five shilling piece was minted in 1965.\\r\\nThe crown coin was nicknamed the dollar, but is not to be confused with the British trade dollar that circulated in the Orient.\\r\\nIn 2014, a new world record price was achieved for a milled silver crown. The coin was issued as a pattern by engraver Thomas Simon in 1663 and nicknamed the \\"Reddite Crown\\". This was presented to Charles II as the new crown piece but was ultimately rejected in favour of the Roettiers Brothers' design. Auctioneers Spink & Son of London sold the coin on 27 March 2014 for S396,000 including commission.[4]\\r\\nAfter decimalisation on 15 February 1971, a new coin known as a 25p (25 pence) piece was introduced. Whilst being legal tender,[5] and having the same decimal value as a crown, the 25p pieces were issued to commemorate events, such as: the 1972 piece was for the Silver Wedding anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; the 1977 issue was to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee of ascension to the throne; the 1980 issue was for the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother; and, in 1981, the coin was issued to celebrate the marriage of Charles, Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer. All of these issues were struck in large mintages, in plastic cases, and in cupro-nickel, an alloy of 75% copper and 25% nickel. However, in addition to this, limited numbers of collectors' coins of these modern issues were struck to proof quality separately by the Royal Mint in sterling (92.5%) silver and presented with certificates of authenticity in boxes. The mintages for the silver proof 25p coins issued are as follows:\\r\\nFurther issues continue to be minted to the present day, initially with a value of twenty-five pence, and then, from 1990, with a value of five pounds.\\r\\nThe legal tender value of the crown remained as five shillings from 1544 to 1965. However, for most of this period there was no denominational designation or \\"face value\\" mark of value displayed on the coin. From 1927 to 1939, the word \\"CROWN\\" appears, and from 1951 to 1960 this was changed to \\"FIVE SHILLINGS\\". After decimalisation in 1971, the face value kept its five shillings equivalent at 25 new pence, later simply 25 pence, although the face value is not shown on any of these issues.\\r\\nFrom 1990, the crown was re-tariffed at five pounds (S5),[1] probably in view of its relatively large size compared with its face value, and taking into consideration its production costs, and the Royal Mint's profits on sales of commemorative coins. While this change was understandable, it has brought with it a slight confusion, and the popular misbelief that all crowns have a five-pound face value, including the pre-1990 ones.\\r\\nAlthough all \\"normal\\" issues since 1951 have been composed of cupro-nickel, special proof versions have been produced for sale to collectors, and as gift items, in silver, gold, and occasionally platinum.\\r\\nThe fact that gold S5 crowns are now produced means that there are two different strains of five pound gold coins, namely crowns and what are now termed \\"quintuple sovereigns\\" for want of a more concise term.[6][7]\\r\\nNumismatically, the term \\"crown-sized\\" is used generically to describe large silver or cupro-nickel coins of about 40?mm in diameter. Most Commonwealth countries still issue crown-sized coins for sale to collectors.\\r\\nNew Zealand's original fifty-cent pieces, and Australia's previously round but now dodecagonal fifty-cent piece, although valued at five shillings in predecimal accounting, are all smaller than the standard silver crown pieces issued by those countries (and the UK). They were in fact similarly sized to the predecimal half crown (worth two shillings and sixpence).\\r\\nFor silver crowns, the grade of silver adhered to the long-standing standard (established in the 12th century by Henry II)?ÿ the Sterling Silver standard of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper. This was a harder-wearing alloy, yet it was still a rather high grade of silver. It went some way towards discouraging the practice of \\"clipping\\", though this practice was further discouraged and largely eliminated with the introduction of the milled edge seen on coins today.\\r\\nIn a debasement process which took effect in 1920, the silver content of all British coins was reduced from 92.5% to 50%, with a portion of the remainder consisting of manganese, which caused the coins to tarnish to a very dark colour after they had been in circulation for a significant period. Silver was eliminated altogether in 1947, with the move to a composition of cupro-nickel?ÿ except for proof issues, which returned to the pre-1920 92.5% silver composition.\\r\\nSince standardisation of the UK's silver coinage in 1816 (UK Coinage Reform 1816), a crown has, as a general rule, had a diameter of 38.61?mm (1.52\\"), and weighed 28.276g (1?oz).[8]\\r\\nThe 1953 Coronation Crown, obverse\\r\\nThe 1953 Coronation Crown, reverse\\r\\n1896 'old head' Queen Victoria Crown\\r\\nThe 1934 George V 'Wreath' Crown","field3":"How much is a crown in british currency?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Bill Foley","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vegas Golden Knights are a professional ice hockey team based in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. The team began play in the 2017ÿ18 NHL season, and is a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team is owned by Black Knight Sports & Entertainment, a consortium led by Bill Foley and the Maloof family.[4] The team plays its home games at T-Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NHL has had a presence in Las Vegas since 1991, when an outdoor game was held in Las Vegas, with the Los Angeles Kings facing the New York Rangers outside Caesars Palace in a preseason exhibition game. The city has since hosted the Frozen Fury, a preseason competition between the Los Angeles Kings and the Colorado Avalanche, and the NHL Awards ceremonies have been held in Las Vegas since 2009.[6] In 2009, the media speculated about a plan involving Hollywood producer Jerry Bruckheimer to move the Phoenix Coyotes to Nevada.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nRumors of a Las Vegas expansion team surfaced again in August 2014, pointing to a new indoor arena on the Strip (built as a joint venture between Anschutz Entertainment Group, owners of the Los Angeles Kings, and MGM Resorts International) as the potential home arena, although these rumors were denied by the league.[8][9][10] In November 2014, an unconfirmed report stated that the league had selected billionaire businessman Bill Foley and the Maloof family (former owners of the National Basketball Association's Sacramento Kings, and founders of the Palms Casino Resort) to lead the ownership group for a Las Vegas expansion team.[11][12] In December 2014, the NHL's board of governors decided to allow Foley to hold a season ticket drive to gauge interest in a Las Vegas team, though league commissioner Gary Bettman also warned the media to \\"[not] make more out of this than it is\\".[13][14] The season ticket drive began in February 2015, with interested parties placing ten percent deposits for the 2016ÿ17 season.[15] The drive drew 5,000 deposits in its first day and a half, and reached its goal of 10,000 deposits by April 2015.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2015, the league officially opened the window for prospective owners to bid on expansion teams. By this point, Foley had secured more than 13,200 season-ticket deposits. Two expansion applications were submitted: Foley's application for a Las Vegas team, and a bid from Quebecor to revive the Quebec Nordiques at a new arena in Quebec City. Both Las Vegas and Quebec were invited to move into Phase II of the league expansion bid in August 2015,[17] and subsequently advanced to Phase III.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the league owners' meeting on June 22, 2016, in Las Vegas, the Las Vegas expansion bid was approved by a unanimous vote, with play to begin in the 2017ÿ18 NHL season.[18] The team became the first major professional sports franchise to be based in Las Vegas, and the first NHL expansion team since 2000.[19] Foley committed to pay the league's $500 million expansion fee[20] and began the process of hiring the team's principal staff and determining its official identity. Foley announced that former Washington Capitals general manager George McPhee would be the franchise's first general manager.[21] On November 22, 2016, the name was revealed as the Vegas Golden Knights.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 1, 2017 (coinciding with the league's trade deadline), the team completed its expansion fee payments and filings, making it eligible to formally begin operations such as free agent acquisition, and participation in league meetings.[22] Five days later, the Golden Knights made their first personnel move by signing Reid Duke to a three-year entry-level contract.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team announced inaugural head coach Gerard Gallant on April 13, 2017.[25] Over the next two months, the Golden Knights developed their farm system, announcing affiliations with the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League and the Quad City Mallards of the ECHL.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team participated in the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft on June 21, 2017, selecting an available player from all 30 teams in the NHL. The draft picks were announced at T-Mobile Arena during the NHL Awards ceremony. Some notable selections included goalie Marc-Andre Fleury from the Pittsburgh Penguins and winger James Neal from the Nashville Predators. At the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, Cody Glass was the first player selected by the Golden Knights. The Golden Knights played their first game on October 6 against the Dallas Stars with Neal scoring the franchise's first two goals en route to their first victory.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team's inaugural home game was played on October 10, 2017, hosting the Arizona Coyotes as the second game of a home-and-home series. In the aftermath of the October 1 mass shooting, the pre-game ceremonies honored the victims of the attack, and the team issued an appeal for donations to its charitable arm.[29] With their 5ÿ2 win, the Golden Knights increased their unbeaten streak to start the season to 3ÿ0, an NHL record for an expansion team.[30][31][32] The Golden Knights are the first team in NHL history to have started their inaugural season winning eight of their first nine games. During their tenth game, goaltender Oscar Dansk was injured becoming the third Golden Knights' goaltender to be injured during the season after losing starters Fleury and the recently acquired Malcolm Subban, forcing the team to start a fourth goaltender in 11 games with Maxime Lagace.[33] Fifteen games into the season, Vadim Shipachyov became the first player to retire from the NHL as a Golden Knight when he decided to return to the Kontinental Hockey League. In December, the Golden Knights set another NHL expansion team record of six straight wins, a record they had previously missed when they lost their tenth game of the season, and established a new NHL record with eight straight wins.[34][35][36] On February 1, 2018, the Golden Knights set the expansion team record for wins in a debut season with 34 wins after only 50 games,[37] and then on February 21, 2018, set a record for most points by an expansion team in the inaugural season with 84.[38] Clinching a berth for the 2018 playoffs on March 26, the Golden Knights became the first team since the Edmonton Oilers and Hartford Whalers in the 1979ÿ80 season to make the playoffs in their inaugural season in the league.[39] On March 31, the Knights clinched the Pacific Division title, becoming the first true expansion team in the four major sports to win its division in its inaugural season (not counting all-expansion divisions, as was the case in the 1967ÿ68 season).[40] They had led the Pacific since December 23. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 11, the franchise won its first playoff game in a 1ÿ0 victory over the Los Angeles Kings in the first game of the series. Six days later on April 17, the franchise earned their first playoff series win against the Kings, winning the fourth game by a 1ÿ0 score, which also became their first playoff series sweep. The Knights became the first team in NHL history to sweep their first playoff series in their inaugural season.[41] On May 6, 2018, the Golden Knights defeated the San Jose Sharks four-games-to-two, becoming the third team in NHL history to win multiple playoff series in their inaugural season, and advanced to the Western Conference Finals.[42] On May 20, Vegas defeated the Winnipeg Jets to win the Western Conference Finals in five games, becoming the third NHL team to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals in its inaugural season, after the Toronto Arenas in 1918 and the St. Louis Blues in 1968.[43] The Golden Knights would lose the Stanley Cup Finals to the Washington Capitals in five games.[44] The Golden Knights are the first, and to date only, true expansion team to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals in their inaugural season. The Golden Knights are additionally the fastest true expansion team to advance to the finals in the history of all four major professional leagues in North America.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team's primary logo is a barbute helmet, superimposed on a black and gold seal, with a V-shaped opening.[46][47] The secondary logo is two crossing swords behind a red star, designed to resemble the star found on the landmark Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team's primary color is steel gray, which is said to represent \\"strength and durability\\".[47][1] The other team colors are gold, red (found in the Las Vegas skyline and at Red Rock Canyon), and black (for \\"power and intensity\\").[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first uniforms in Golden Knights team history were unveiled publicly on June 20, 2017.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team's name includes \\"Knights\\" as a homage to the Black Knights of the United States Military Academy, Foley's alma mater, and because knights were, according to Foley, \\"the epitome of the warrior class\\".[46][49] Foley had hoped to name his team the Black Knights, but dropped that plan after encountering resistance from federal officials. Foley was unable to call the team the \\"Vegas Knights\\" due to the London Knights owning the \\"Knights\\" name in Canada.[49][50][51]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Golden\\" was included in the name because gold is, as Foley stated, the \\"No. 1 precious metal\\", and because Nevada is the largest gold-producing state in the country.[49][47] \\"Las\\" was omitted from the team's name because, according to Foley, residents tend to refer to the city simply as \\"Vegas\\", and because a four-word name would have been too long.[52][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Army initially expressed concern after the Golden Knights' name was announced, because their parachute team uses the same nickname.[50] The Army later disputed the trademark and colors of the team during its first season, to which the team responded: \\"We are not aware of a single complaint from anyone attending our games that they were expecting to see the parachute team and not a professional hockey game.\\"[53] An objection was also raised by the College of Saint Rose because its sports teams use the same name; the Vegas team's initial trademark application was denied as a result, but was later approved on appeal.[54] The team did clear the name with Clarkson University, which also uses the name Golden Knights.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Golden Knights' mascot is a Gila monster named Chance. He was unveiled at the team's second home game on October 13, 2017.[56][57] The team opted against using a knight for a mascot because it found that knight mascots used by other teams were not very child-friendly.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nAT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain is the regional television rightsholder for all Golden Knights games not broadcast nationally by NBCSN or NBC. The team's designated market includes Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, and parts of Arizona and California.[59][60][61] Golden Knights games on AT&T SportsNet are called by former Boston Bruins radio announcer Dave Goucher on play-by-play, and Shane Hnidy, who previously worked color for the Winnipeg Jets on TSN.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team has a three-year radio deal with Lotus Broadcasting.[63] Lotus airs the team's games on its Fox Sports Radio affiliate, KRLV 1340/98.9.[63] KRLV fronts a network of nine stations across Nevada, California, Arizona, and Utah.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne game a week is also aired on the company's ESPN Deportes Radio affiliate, KENO 1460, making the team one of only three in the NHL to offer Spanish-language broadcasts.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 16, 2017, the Golden Knights entered a multi-year affiliation agreement with a minor league team, the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League. Like most NHL-AHL affiliation arrangements, the Golden Knights are able to transfer players to and from the Wolves.[26] Although the Wolves are the Golden Knights affiliate, the two teams do not share the same ownership. In addition to the Wolves, the Golden Knights were affiliated with the Quad City Mallards of the ECHL for the 2017ÿ18 season,[27] however, the Mallards ceased operations after the one season.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a complete list of the seasons completed by the Golden Knights.

The list was first published in March 1987.[1] The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated and is cited in United States dollars, based on their documented assets and accounting for debt. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists.[3] This ranking is an index of the wealthiest documented individuals, excluding and ranking against those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained.[4]\\r\\nIn 2017, there was a record of 2,043 people on the list, which is the first time over 2,000 people were listed, that included 195 newcomers that included 76 from China and 25 from the U.S.; there were 56 people under 40 and it had a record of 227 women.[5] The average net worth of the list came in at US$3.75?billion, down US$110?million from 2015. Added together, the total net worth for 2017's billionaires was US$7.67?trillion, up from US$7.1?trillion in 2015.[2][6] In 2017, 500 of the richest people in the world became richer by $1 trillion, according to a report by Bloomberg News.[7][8] As of 2017[update], Microsoft founder Bill Gates has topped the list 18 of the past 23 years.[2]\\r\\nAccording to a 2017 Oxfam report, the top eight billionaires own as much combined wealth as \\"half the human race\\".[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year, Forbes employs a team of more than 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world's wealthiest individuals.[11] Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to Forbes, they received three types of responses?ÿ some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions.[12] Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets?ÿ land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc.?ÿ are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual's holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual's estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual's true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.[11]\\r\\nFamily fortunes dispersed over a large number of relatives are included only if those individuals' holdings are worth more than a billion dollars. However, when a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members, it is included under a single listing provided that individual is still living.[11] Royal familys and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.[13]\\r\\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worth listed are snapshots taken at that time. These lists only show the top 10 wealthiest billionaires.\\r\\nOn the 30th anniversary of the Forbes' list of the world's billionaires, for the fourth year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world.[2] The number of billionaires increased 13% to 2,043 from 1,810 in 2016; this is the biggest change in over 30 years of tracking billionaires globally.[2] This is the first time after 12 years that Carlos Slim was not within the top five. The U.S. continues to have the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 565. China has 319 (not including Hong Kong or Macau), Germany has 114, and India has the fourth most with 101; India has reached over 100 billionaires for its first time.\\r\\nFor the third year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world by Forbes's 2016 list of the world's billionaires.[14] This is the 17th time that the founder of Microsoft has claimed the top spot. Amancio Ortega rose from last year's position of number four to second.[15] Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway came in third for the second consecutive time,[16] while Mexican telecommunication mogul Carlos Slim slipped down from last year's second position to fourth. Jeff Bezos of Amazon,[17] Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook[18] and Michael Bloomberg of Bloomberg L.P.,[19] appear for the first time on the Forbes top 10 billionaires list, coming at fifth, sixth and eighth position, respectively. Zuckerberg became the youngest top 10 billionaire this year at the age of 31. Larry Ellison, Charles Koch and David Koch also slipped down from their last year's positions, with Ellison dropping to seventh from fifth and the Kochs falling to ninth position from sixth, respectively.\\r\\nIn the 29th annual Forbes list of global billionaires, a record 1,826 billionaires were named with an aggregated net worth of $7.1 trillion compared to $6.4 trillion last year. 46 of the billionaires in this list are under the age of 40. A record number of 290 people joined the list for the first time, of whom 25 percent hail from China, which produced a world-leading 71 newcomers. The United States came in second, with 57, followed by India, with 28, and Germany, with 23.[20] The United States has the largest number of billionaires with 526. Russia went down to 88 from 111 in 2014. Russia was placed behind China, Germany and India by the number of billionaires. Self-made billionaires made up the largest number of people on the list with 1,191 positions (over 65 percent) while just 230 (under 13 percent) have wealth through inheritance. The number of billionaires who inherited a portion but are still working to increase their fortunes is 405.[21]\\r\\nBill Gates was named the richest man in the world by Forbes's annual list of the world's billionaires. This was the 16th time that the founder of Microsoft claimed the top spot. Carlos Slim came in second for the second consecutive time. Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway was placed third, while Amancio Ortega of Spain, slipped down a position from last year to number four. Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle rounded off the top five. Christy Walton was the highest-ranking female at number eight. America's Evan Spiegel, co-founder of photo messaging app Snapchat became the youngest billionaire this year at the age of 24. At age 99, David Rockefeller maintained his position as the oldest billionaire to be included in the list.[22] Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, rose to number 16 with $33.4 billion. Iceland had a billionaire, Thor Bjorgolfsson, in the list after a gap of five years. Guatemala had a billionaire, Mario Lopez Estrada, for the first time in its history.[23]\\r\\nBill Gates added $9 billion to his fortune since 2013 and topped the Forbes 2014 billionaire list. He has topped the list 15 of the previous 20 years, but his previous number one ranking was in 2009.[24] Mexican telecommunication mogul Carlos Slim came in second place after being number one the previous four years. Zara founder Amancio Ortega placed third for the second consecutive year. American investor Warren Buffett was in the top five for the 20th consecutive year, placing fourth.[25] America's Christy Walton was the highest ranking woman, placing ninth overall.[1] Aliko Dangote of Nigeria became the first African ever to enter the top 25, with an estimated net worth of $25 billion.[3]\\r\\nA total of 1,645 people made the 2014 billionaire list, representing combined wealth of $6.4 trillion.[25] Of those, a record 268 were newcomers, surpassing 2008's 226 newcomers.[1] One hundred people listed in 2013 failed to make the list.[25] The number of women on the list rose to a record 172 in 2014.[1] Approximately 66 percent of the list was self-made, 13 percent achieved their wealth through inheritance alone, and 21 percent through a mixture of the two.[3]\\r\\nThe United States had 492 billionaires on the list, the most of any country.[25] The country also had the most newcomers with 50, and women with 54.[1] China had the second most billionaires with 152, while Russia was third with 111.[25] Algeria, Lithuania, Tanzania, and Uganda were all represented on the list for the first time. Turkey saw the most people drop off the list, 19, due to a period of high inflation in the country.[3]\\r\\nCarlos Slim topped the 2013 billionaire list, marking his fourth consecutive year at the top. Bill Gates remained in second, while Amancio Ortega moved up to third. Ortega's gain of $19.5 billion was the largest of anyone on the list.[26] Warren Buffett failed to make the top three for the first time since 2000, placing fourth. Diesel founder Renzo Rosso was among the top newcomers, debuting with an estimate net worth of $3 billion.[27]\\r\\nA global rise in asset prices, led Forbes editor Randall Lane to declare \\"It [was] a very good year to be a billionaire\\". However, it was not a good year to be Eike Batista who fell from seventh to 100th, suffering the largest net loss of anyone on the list.[26] Overall, net gainers outnumbered net losers by 4:1.[27]\\r\\nA record total of 1,426 people made the 2013 list, representing $5.4 trillion of assets.[28] Of those, 442 billionaires hailed from the United States.[26] The Asian-Pacific region had 386 billionaires and Europe 366. The list also featured a record number of newcomers, 210, representing 42 different countries. Sixty people from the 2012 list fell below a billion dollar of assets in 2013 and eight others from the 2012 list died. The Asia-Pacific region had the most drop-offs, with 29, followed by the United States with 16. The 2013 list featured 138 women, of which 50 came from the United States. A majority of the list (961 individuals, 67 percent) was entirely self-made; 184 (13 percent) inherited their wealth, and 281 (20 percent) achieved their fortune through a combination of inheritance and business acumen.[28]\\r\\nCarlos Slim topped the 2012 list, marking this third consecutive year at the top. Bill Gates placed second, but narrowed the gap from 2011 as Slim's fortune fell $5 billion while Gates' rose $5 billion. Warren Buffett remained in third place. Bernard Arnault of France was the top-ranking European on the list, placing fourth.[29] Ricardo Salinas Pliego was the greatest gainer in terms of dollars, adding $9.2 billion to his fortune and moving up to number 37 overall.[29] Making her debut on the list at age 27, Spanx founder Sara Blakely became the youngest self-made female billionaire ever.[30] Colombia's Alejandro Santo Domingo was the highest-ranked newcomer, inheriting a $9.5 billion stake in Santo Domingo Group from his father.[29] India's Lakshmi Mittal was the largest loser as his fortune dropped from $31.1 billion to $20.7 billion as the price of steel maker ArcelorMittal fell sharply.[29] As a result, he failed to make the top 10 for the first time since 2004 and lost his title of richest Asian to Hong Kongs Li Ka-shing.[31]\\r\\nA record total of 1,226 people made the 2012 list, representing 58 different countries. Of those, 126 were newcomers to the list and 104 were women. The United States had the greatest number of billionaires with 425. Russia had 96 people on the list, while China had 95.[29] Georgia, Morocco, and Peru were newly represented on the list. Falling stock prices in Asia contributed to 117 former billionaires falling from the list worldwide. Twelve others listed in 2011 died. Overall, net gainers (460) barely outnumbered net losers (441).[31]\\r\\nTo coincide with the release of the 2012 list, Forbes announced a new \\"Billionaire Real-Time Ticker\\" updating the wealth of the world's top fifty billionaires in real time.[29]\\r\\nIn the 25th annual Forbes list of global billionaires, Carlos Slim added $20.5 billion to his fortune, the most of anyone, and retained his number one ranking with a total fortune of $74 billion. Bill Gates remained in second place with $56 billion, while Warren Buffett was third with $50 billion. The top 10 had a combined wealth of $406 billion, up from $342 billion in 2010.[32] According to Forbes editor Kerry Dolan, \\"media and technology billionaires definitely benefited from a stronger stock market and a growing enthusiasm for all things social\\" since the 2010 list.[33] However, Nigerian commodity mogul Aliko Dangote was the greatest gainer on a percentage basis as his fortune increased 557 percent to $13.5 billion. Mark Zuckerberg was one of seven Facebook-related billionaires on the list, as he $9.5 billion to his fortune to move up to 52nd. Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz was the youngest person on the list. Aged 26, eight days younger than Zuckerberg, he debuted at number 420 with an estimated fortune of $2.7 billion. IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad was the largest loser as he saw his fortune plummet from $23 billion to $6 billion, dropping him from 11th to 162nd overall.[32]\\r\\nA record 1,210 billionaires made the 2011 list, representing a combined wealth of $4.5 trillion, up from $3.6 trillion the previous year.[34] One third of the world's billionaires, 413, came from the United States. China had the second most billionaires with 115, while Russia was third with 101. Asia moved up to 332 billionaires, passing Europe as a region for the first time since the 1990s.[32] The 2011 list included 214 newcomers and the average net worth of those on it increased to $3.7 billion.[33]\\r\\nCarlos Slim narrowly eclipsed Bill Gates to top the billionaire list for the first time. Slim saw his estimated worth surge $18.5 billion to $53.5 billion as shares of America Movil rose 35 percent. Gates' estimated wealth rose $13 billion to $53 billion, placing him second. Warren Buffett was third with $47 billion.[35] Christy Walton was the highest-ranking woman, placing 12th overall, with an inherited fortune of $22.5 billion.[36] At age 25, Mark Zuckerberg continued to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire.[12] American Isaac Perlmutter was among the newcomers with an estimated fortune of $4 billion largely acquired in his sale of Marvel Entertainment to Disney.[35]\\r\\nA total of 1,011 people made the 2010 list. The United States accounted for 403 billionaires, followed by China with 89 and Russia with 62.[36] It was the first time China, while including Hong Kong, placed second.[35] A total of 55 countries were represented on the 2010 list, including Finland and Pakistan which claimed their first billionaires.[36] Eighty-nine women made the list, but only 14 of them were self-made.[36] The combined net worth of the list was $3.6 trillion, up 50 percent from 2009's $2.4 trillion, while the average net worth was $3.5 billion.[12]\\r\\nThe 2010 list featured 164 re-entries and 97 true newcomers.[12] Asia accounted for more than 100 of the new entrants. Overall, just 12 percent of the list lost wealth since 2009, and 30 people fell off the list. Thirteen others died.[35] Of the 89 women, 12 were newcomers in 2010. Steve Forbes said the growing number of billionaires was clear sign that the world's economy was recovering from 2009's global financial crisis.[12]\\r\\nIn June 2010, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates announce The Giving Pledge that is a promise to give the majority of their wealth to philanthropy. As of 2017, the pledge has 158 signatories, but some of the signatories have since died. Most of the signers of the pledge are billionaires, and their pledges total to over $365 billion.[37]\\r\\nIn the wake of the Financial crisis of 2007ÿ2008, the world's billionaires lose $2 trillion in net worth and the list becomes 30% smaller than the previous year's list.\\r\\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, four years after starting the company, joins the list at 23 to become the youngest self-made billionaire.\\r\\nThe founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, become billionaires at age 30.\\r\\nOprah Winfrey becomes the first female African American billionaire.\\r\\nAs a result of the market crash caused by the Dot-com bubble, 83 billionaires drop off the list from the previous year.\\r\\nIn 2001, BET founder Robert L. Johnson became the first ever African-American billionaire.[38]\\r\\nBill Gates became the first American to take the top spot of the World's Billionaires in 1995 with a net worth of $12.5 billion and he remained there during the Dot-com bubble's height in 1999 when Gates' fortune peaked at $90 billion. After the dot-com bubble started to collapse in 2000, his wealth dropped to $60 billion although he remained at the top of the list.\\r\\nThe dot-com bubble created the most paper wealth for some billionaires. However, once the dotcom bubble burst the new rich saw their fortunes disappear.[39] Billionaires' fortunes were hit even harder by the global financial crisis; 2009 was the first time in five years that the world had a net loss in the number of billionaires.[40] The strong performance of the financial markets and global economic recovery have erased financial assets losses. Most of the richest people in the world have seen their fortunes soar in the early 2010s.[41][42]\\r\\nSource: Forbes.[6][44][43][45]","field3":"Who's the highest paid person in the world?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"about 35 species","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 35; see text.\\r\\n\\r\\nA spruce is a tree of the genus Picea /pa??si??/,[1] a genus of about 35 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the family Pinaceae, found in the northern temperate and boreal (taiga) regions of the Earth. Spruces are large trees, from about 20ÿ60 m (about 60ÿ200?ft) tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form. The needles, or leaves, of spruces are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion, each needle on a small, peg-like structure. The needles are shed when 4ÿ10 years old, leaving the branches rough with the retained pegs (an easy means of distinguishing them from other similar genera, where the branches are fairly smooth).\\r\\n\\r\\nSpruce are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (moth and butterfly) species, such as the eastern spruce budworm. They are also used by the larvae of gall adelgids (Adelges species).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mountains of western Sweden, scientists have found a Norway spruce, nicknamed Old Tjikko, which by reproducing through layering, has reached an age of 9,550 years and is claimed to be the world's oldest known living tree.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\"spruce\\" entered the English language from the Polish Prusy, Prussia (a historical region, today part of Poland and Kaliningrad Oblast). It became spruce because in Polish, z Prus (\\"from Prussia\\") sounded like \\"spruce\\" to English speakers and was a generic term for commodities brought to England by Hanseatic merchants and because the tree was believed to have come from Polish Ducal Prussia.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nDNA analyses[5][6] have shown that traditional classifications based on the morphology of needle and cone are artificial. A recent study[5] found that P. breweriana had a basal position, followed by P. sitchensis, and the other species were further divided into three clades, suggesting that Picea originated in North America. Spruce has been found in the fossil record from the early Cretaceous, 136 million years ago.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty-five named species of spruce exist in the world. The Plant List has 59 accepted spruce names.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBasal species:\\r\\n\\r\\nDetermining that a tree is a spruce is not difficult; evergreen needles that are more or less quadrangled, and especially the pulvinus, give it away. Beyond that, determination can become more difficult. Intensive sampling in the Smithers/Hazelton/Houston area of British Columbia showed Douglas (1975),[9] according to Coates et al. (1994),[10] that cone scale morphology was the feature most useful in differentiating species of spruce; the length, width, length: width ratio, the length of free scale (the distance from the imprint of the seed wing to the tip of the scale), and the percentage free scale (length of free scale as a percentage of the total length of the scale) were most useful in this regard. Daubenmire (1974),[11] after range-wide sampling, had already recognized the importance of the 2 latter characters. Taylor (1959)[12] had noted that the most obvious morphological difference between typical Picea glauca and typical P. engelmannii was the cone scale, and Horton (1956,1959)[13][14] found that the most useful diagnostic features of the 2 spruces are in the cone; differences occur in the flower, shoot and needle, \\"but those in the cone are most easily assessed\\" (Horton 1959).[14] Coup et al. (1982)[15] recommended that cone scale characters be based on samples taken from the midsection of each of 10 cones from each of 5 trees in the population of interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout cones, morphological differentiation among spruce species and their hybrids is more difficult. Species classification for seeds collected from spruce stands in which introgressive hybridization between white and Sitka spruces (P. sitchensis) may have occurred is important for determining appropriate cultural regimens in the nursery. If, for instance, white spruce grown at container nurseries in southwestern British Columbia are not given an extended photoperiod, leader growth ceases early in the first growing season, and seedlings do not reach the minimum height specifications.[16][17]  But, if an extended photoperiod is provided for Sitka spruce, seedlings become unacceptably tall by the end of the first growing season .[18] Species classification of seedlots collected in areas where hybridization of white and Sitka spruces has been reported has depended on (i) easily measured cone scale characters of seed trees, especially free scale length, (ii) visual judgements of morphological characters, e.g., growth rhythm, shoot and root weight, and needle serration, or (iii) some combination of (i) and (ii) (Yeh and Arnott 1986).[18] Useful to a degree, these classification procedures have important limitations; genetic composition of the seeds produced by a stand is determined by both the seed trees and the pollen parents, and species classification of hybrid seedlots and estimates of their level of introgression on the basis of seed-tree characteristics can be unreliable when hybrid seedlots vary in their introgressiveness in consequence of spatial and temporal variations in contributions from the pollen parent (Yeh and Arnott 1986).[18] Secondly, morphological characters are markedly influenced by ontogenetic and environmental influences, so that to discern spruce hybrid seedlot composition with accuracy, hybrid seedlots must differ substantially in morphology from both parent species. Yeh and Arnott (1986)[18] pointed out the difficulties of estimating accurately the degree of introgression between white and Sitka spruces; introgression may have occurred at low levels, and/or hybrid seed lots may vary in their degree of introgression in consequence of repeated backcrossing with parental species.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpruce seedlings are most susceptible immediately following germination, and remain highly susceptible through to the following spring. More than half of spruce seedling mortality probably occurs during the first growing season and is also very high during the first winter,[19] when seedlings are subjected to freezing damage, frost heaving and erosion, as well as smothering by litter and snow-pressed vegetation. Seedlings that germinate late in the growing season are particularly vulnerable because they are tiny and have not had time to harden off fully.\\r\\n\\r\\nMortality rates generally decrease sharply thereafter, but losses often remain high for some years. \\"Establishment\\" is a subjective concept based on the idea that once a seedling has successfully reached a certain size, not much is likely to prevent its further development. Criteria vary, of course, but Noble and Ronco (1978),[20] for instance, considered that seedlings 4 to 5 years old, or 8?cm to 10?cm tall, warranted the designation \\"established\\", since only unusual factors such as snow mold, fire, trampling, or predation would then impair regeneration success. Eis (1967)[21] suggested that in dry habitats on either mineral soil or litter seedbeds a 3-year-old seedling may be considered established; in moist habitats, seedlings may need 4 or 5 years to become established on mineral soil, possibly longer on litter seedbeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth remains very slow for several to many years. Three years after shelterwood felling in subalpine Alberta, dominant regeneration averaged 5.5?cm in height in scarified blocks, and 7.3?cm in non-scarified blocks (Day 1970),[22] possibly reflecting diminished fertility with the removal of the A horizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpruce is useful as a building wood, commonly referred to by several different names including North American timber, SPF (spruce, pine, fir) and whitewood (the collective name for spruce wood). Spruce wood is used for many purposes, ranging from general construction work and crates to highly specialised uses in wooden aircraft. The Wright brothers' first aircraft, the Flyer, was built of spruce.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause this species has no insect or decay resistance qualities after logging, it is generally recommended for construction purposes as indoor use only (ex. indoor drywall framing). Spruce wood, when left outside cannot be expected to last more than 12ÿ18 months depending on the type of climate it is exposed to.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpruce is one of the most important woods for paper uses, as it has long wood fibres which bind together to make strong paper. The fibres are thin walled and collapse to thin bands upon drying. Spruces are commonly used in mechanical pulping as they are easily bleached. Together with northern pines, northern spruces are commonly used to make NBSK. Spruces are cultivated over vast areas as pulpwood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fresh shoots of many spruces are a natural source of vitamin C.[24] Captain Cook made alcoholic sugar-based spruce beer during his sea voyages in order to prevent scurvy in his crew.[25][26] The leaves and branches, or the essential oils, can be used to brew spruce beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tips from the needles can be used to make spruce tip syrup[clarification needed]. In survival situations spruce needles can be directly ingested or boiled into a tea.[27] This replaces large amounts of vitamin C. Also, water is stored in a spruce's needles, providing an alternative means of hydration[clarification needed]. Spruce can be used as a preventive measure for scurvy in an environment where meat is the only prominent food source[clarification needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nSpruce is the standard material used in soundboards for many musical instruments, including guitars, mandolins, cellos, violins, and the soundboard at the heart of a piano and the harp.\\r\\nWood used for this purpose is referred to as tonewood.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpruce, along with cedar, is often used for the soundboard/top of an acoustic guitar. The main types of spruce used for this purpose are Sitka, Engelmann, Adirondack and European spruces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resin was used in the manufacture of pitch in the past (before the use of petrochemicals); the scientific name Picea derives from Latin picea \\"pitch pine\\" (referring to Scots pine),[28] from piceus, an adjective from pix \\"pitch\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nNative Americans in North America use the thin, pliable roots of some species for weaving baskets and for sewing together pieces of birch bark for canoes. See also Kiidk'yaas for an unusual golden Sitka Spruce sacred to the Haida people.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpruces are popular ornamental trees in horticulture, admired for their evergreen, symmetrical narrow-conic growth habit. For the same reason, some (particularly Picea abies and P. omorika) are also extensively used as Christmas trees, with artificial Christmas trees often being produced in their likenesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpruce branches are also used at Aintree racecourse, Liverpool, to build several of the fences on the Grand National course. It is also used to make sculptures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closely related species Sirococcus conigenus and S. piceicola cause shoot blight and seedling mortality of conifers in North America, Europe, and North Africa.[29] Twig blight damage to seedlings of white and red spruces in a nursery near Asheville, North Carolina, was reported by Graves (1914).[30] Hosts include white, black, Engelmann, Norway, and red spruces, although they are not the plants most commonly damaged. Sirococcus blight of spruces in nurseries show up randomly in seedlings to which the fungus was transmitted in infested seed. First-year seedlings are often killed, and larger plants may become too deformed for planting. Outbreaks involving < 30% of spruce seedlings in seedbeds have been traced to seed lots in which only 0.1% to 3% of seeds were infested. Seed infestation has in turn been traced to the colonization of spruce cones by S. conigenus in forests of the western interior. Infection develops readily if conidia are deposited on succulent plant parts that remain wet for at least 24 hours at 10?C to 25?C. Longer periods of wetness favour increasingly severe disease. Twig tips killed during growth the previous year shows a characteristic crook.\\r\\n\\r\\nRhizosphaera infects white spruce, blue spruce (Picea pungens), and Norway spruces throughout Ontario, causing severe defoliation and sometimes killing small, stressed trees. White spruce is intermediately susceptible. Dead needles show rows of black fruiting bodies. Infection usually begins on lower branches. On white spruce, infected needles are usually retained on the tree into the following summer. The fungicide Chlorthalonil is registered for controlling this needle cast (Davis 1997).[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nA branch and stem canker associated with the fungus Valsa kunzei Fr. var. picea was reported on white and Norway spruces in Ontario (Jorgensen and Cafley 1961)[32] and Quebec (Ouellette and Bard 1962).[33] In Ontario, only trees of low vigour were affected, but in Quebec vigorous trees were also infected.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall mammals consume conifer seeds, and also eat seedlings. Cage feeding of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi) showed a daily maximum seed consumption of 2000 white spruce seeds and of 1000 seeds of lodgepole pine, with the 2 species of mice consuming equal amounts of seed, but showing a preference for the pine over the spruce (Wagg 1963).[34] The short-tailed meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus Ord) voraciously ate all available white spruce and lodgepole pine seedlings, pulling them out of the ground and holding them between their front feet until the whole seedling had been consumed. Wagg (1963)[34] attributed damage observed to the bark and cambium at ground level of small white spruce seedlings over several seasons to meadow voles.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce shed, seeds contribute to the diet of small mammals, e.g., deer mice, red-backed voles, mountain voles (Microtus montanus), and chipmunks (Eutamias minimus). The magnitude of the loss is difficult to determine, and studies with and without seed protection have yielded conflicting results. In western Montana, for example, spruce seedling success was little better on protected than on unprotected seed spots (Schopmeyer and Helmers 1947),[35] but in British Columbia spruce regeneration depended on protection from rodents (Smith 1955).[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important albeit indirect biotic constraint on spruce establishment is the depredation of seed by squirrels. As much as 90% of a cone crop has been harvested by red squirrels (Zasada et al. 1978).[37] Deer mice, voles, chipmunks, and shrews can consume large quantities of seed; 1 mouse can eat 2000 seeds per night (Radvanyi 1970b).[38] Repeated applications of half a million seeds/ha failed to produce the 750 trees/ha sought by Northwest Pulp and Power, Ltd., near Hinton, Alberta (Radvanyi 1972),[39] but no doubt left a lot of well-fed small mammals. Foraging by squirrels for winter buds (Rowe 1952)[40] has not been reported in relation to young plantations, but Wagg (1963)[34] noted that at Hinton AB, red squirrels were observed cutting the lateral and terminal twigs and feeding on the vegetative and flower buds of white spruce.\\r\\n\\r\\nRed squirrels in Alaska have harvested as much as 90% of a cone crop (Zasada et al. 1978);[37] their modus operandi is to cut off great numbers of cones with great expedition early in the fall, and then \\"spend the rest of the fall shelling out the seeds\\".

Milton Oliver Fife[nb 1] is a fictional character in the American television program The Andy Griffith Show, portrayed by comic actor Don Knotts. Barney Fife is a deputy sheriff in the slow-paced, sleepy southern community of Mayberry, North Carolina. He appeared in the first five seasons (1960ÿ65) as a main character, and, after leaving the show at the end of season five, made a few guest appearances in the following three color seasons (1965ÿ68). He also appeared in the first episode of the spin-off series Mayberry R.F.D. (1968ÿ1971), and in the 1986 reunion telemovie Return to Mayberry. Additionally, Barney appeared in the Joey Bishop Show episode, \\"Joey's Hideaway Cabin\\" and, unnamed, in the first episode of The New Andy Griffith Show.\\r\\nIn 1999, TV Guide ranked him Ninth on its 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time list.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore joining Griffith's show, Don Knotts was a regular on The Steve Allen Show, in which he played several parts. most notably \\"Mr. Morrison,\\" a nervous man on the street character, upon which Knotts' based the personality of Barney Fife, who himself was a hyperkinetic but comically inept counterpart to Mayberry's practical and composed Sheriff Andy Taylor.\\r\\nAccording to Andy Griffith, the character of Barney Fife was suggested by Don Knotts himself. At the same time that The Steve Allen Show was ending, Knotts was looking for work. When he saw the episode of The Danny Thomas Show featuring Andy Taylor, he called Griffith suggesting that his sheriff character might reasonably need a deputy. Griffith liked the idea and suggested that he call Executive Producer Sheldon Leonard. Griffith later recalled that Don Knotts' contribution was the show's saving grace because he was uncomfortable with the original concept to have Andy Taylor being the comic lead. In an interview with The Archive of American Television, Griffith admitted: \\"The second episode was called 'Manhunt' and I knew by that episode that Don should be the comic and I should play straight for him. That made all the difference.\\"\\r\\nFife appeared on The Andy Griffith Show from the show's beginning in 1960 until 1965, when Knotts left the show to pursue a career in feature films. It is explained that Fife had left Mayberry to take a job as a detective in Raleigh. Knotts reprised the character in guest appearances each season until The Andy Griffith Show left the air in 1968. Barney also appeared in the inaugural Mayberry R.F.D. episode, in which Andy and Helen Crump marry. In 1971, the character, whose name is not explicitly mentioned, appears in the premiere episode of The New Andy Griffith Show, visiting the mid-sized city of Greenwood to catch up with Mayor Andy Sawyer, who looks exactly like Andy Taylor and shares some of Taylor's earlier mannerisms and friendships with Fife, Goober Pyle and Emmett Clark. Fifteen years would pass before the character was again reprised in the reunion film Return to Mayberry in 1986. By then, Fife had moved back and become the town's acting sheriff.\\r\\nSometimes considered a blowhard with delusions of grandeur, he fancies himself an expert on firearms, women, singing, and just about any other topic of conversation brought up while he is around. Conversely, Andy knows that Barney's false bravado is a smokescreen for his insecurities and low self-confidence. In one episode, Barney brags that he knows about the Emancipation Proclamation. When Andy calls Barney's bluff and asks him to elaborate it to Opie for his history class, Barney becomes upset and defensive and blurts out that it was a proclamation for emancipation and leaves, irritated.\\r\\nBarney is often overly analytical and alarmist about benign situations, such as the modest Mayberry crime scene. He takes a minor infraction, blows it out of proportion, and then concocts an elaborate solution (sometimes involving inept civilians, like Otis Campbell or Gomer Pyle) to resolve it. In one early episode, where Andy was briefly summoned away, acting sheriff Barney proceeds to book and lock up nearly everyone in town. Despite his shortcomings, Barney is zealous about law enforcement, regularly spouting off penal codes and ordinances to thugs and jaywalkers alike.\\r\\nAn emotional powderkeg, Barney often overreacts with panic, despair or bug-eyed fear. Barney is smug and self-confident, and is known for engaging in gossip and revealing both personal and police secrets, often with dire consequences. Outwardly \\"a man of the world,\\" Barney is truly na?ve and easily duped. Though constantly warned by Andy, Barney falls for countless scams. This gullibility is evident in many episodes, including \\"Barney's First Car\\", where he is conned into buying a lemon from a crafty old widow. Andy mentions in the episode \\"Andy on Trial\\" that Barney likes to smoke a cigar when he's feeling \\"sporty\\".\\r\\nLike Andy, who was stationed in France, Barney served in World War II, although he was a file clerk who never left the United States (he stated that \\"me and this other fella ran the PX library\\" on Staten Island). Barney was nevertheless proud of his war record: \\"I did my part to lick the dreaded Hun,\\" he boasted in the \\"Quiet Sam\\" episode.\\r\\nNonetheless, Barney still has his rare moments of courage and loyalty. Perhaps the greatest example of Barney's courage is in the episode \\"Jailbreak\\": Barney, with help from Andy in tracking them down, saves a member of the state police who has been captured, apprehends the criminal and his partner by driving off with the crooks and their hostage attached in their trailer, and drives them to jail with Andy close behind with his siren wailing. It's one of the rare occasions when Barney actually catches the crooks intentionally and not by accident.\\r\\nOne major comedic source is Barney's lack of ability with a firearm. After numerous misfires (usually a Colt .38 caliber revolver), Andy restricts Barney to carrying only one bullet in his shirt pocket, \\"in case of an emergency.\\" However, the bullet always seems to find its way back into the gun, where Barney accidentally shoots it, usually into the floor, the ceiling, or his own gun holster. The accidental discharge of Barney's gun becomes a running gag. Another gag has Barney locking himself or together with Andy in one of the jail cells, with the keys just out of reach. Realizing that they can't get out, they shamelessly yell for help.\\r\\nIn the first season, Andy and Barney comment that they are cousins, and is also curtly mentioned several times in subsequent shows. Genetics aside, Barney and \\"Ange\\" (as he frequently addresses Andy, a derivation from Knotts' real-life nickname for Griffith) are best friends, having grown up together in Mayberry, even graduating from the same class at Mayberry High School in 1945. Barney maintains warm relations with Andy's son Opie and his Aunt Bee. In another episode, Andy finds a document indicating he issued Barney his gun in August, 1953 when he gave Barney his oath of office as his deputy.\\r\\nWhen he's not patrolling the streets of Mayberry, Barney spends his free time dating a local girl named Thelma Lou (Betty Lynn) (whom he eventually marries in Return to Mayberry, a 1986 NBC movie). Thelma Lou is Barney's main girlfriend until his 1965 departure. He had two other girlfriends; the first Miss Rosemary followed by Hilda May.[2] Barney also dates other women, in particular, an oft-mentioned but never seen Junction Cafe and Bluebird Diner waitress named Juanita. She is first mentioned in the episode \\"Andy Forecloses\\". Not content to focus solely on his own love life, Barney quite often gets involved in Andy's romantic interests. Lydia Crosswaithe was one of the young ladies whom he and Thelma Lou tried to match with Mayberry's sheriff. Unfortunately, Lydia's withdrawn, exceedingly odd personality doomed any hopes that Andy would actually date her.\\r\\nBarney takes up residence in a few places including the Raleigh YMCA and Mrs. Mendelbright's boarding house (where she forbids him from owning either a hot plate or light bulb over 40 watts). In \\"Sheriff Barney\\" we learn that Barney lives at 411 Elm Street, but it is unclear if this address refers to Barney's own home or Mrs. Mendelbright's boarding house address. When not on duty, he is usually seen in a Panama straw hat and a tweed suit (the \\"old salt and pepper.\\") Although the deputy fancies himself a singer, he has a tin ear, as highlighted by several episodes, most notably, \\"Barney and the Choir\\" and \\"The Song Festers.\\"\\r\\nSome continuity slip-ups can be expected, as the series had several writers. An illustration of this is with the various middle names given for both Barney and Andy. In the episode \\"Class Reunion\\", Barney's middle name is Milton, though at other times he is called \\"Bernard P. Fife\\". In another episode, where he believes he is the descendant of Nathan Tibbs, a Mayberry Revolutionary hero, he says his name is \\"Barney 'Tibbs' Fife\\". Andy jokingly says, \\"I thought your middle name was Oliver.\\" A similar problem exists with Andy's middle name, which was given as Jackson on his own show (when his high school photo was shown), but his newborn son's name was given as Andrew Samuel Taylor Jr. on Mayberry RFD (during a christening).\\r\\nHe is featured in these Andy Griffith Show episodes:\\r\\nCalling a police officer or authority figure \\"Barney Fife\\" has become an American slang term for gross ineptitude or overzealousness. A notable example occurred during the Scott Peterson case, in which the defendant's mother referred to the local police captain as \\"Barney Fife.\\"[3]","field3":"What type of gun did barney fife carry?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"approximately 13 wpm","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Words per minute, commonly abbreviated WPM, is a measure of words processed in a minute, often used as a measurement of the speed of typing, reading or Morse code sending and receiving.\\r\\nSince the length or duration of words is clearly variable, for the purpose of such measurement, the definition of each word is often standardized to be five characters or keystrokes long in English,[1] including spaces and punctuation. For example, under such a method applied to plain English text the phrase \\"I run\\" counts as one word, but \\"rhinoceros\\" and \\"let's talk\\" would both count as two.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrandon Raziano found that one study of average computer users in 1998, the average rate for transcription was 33 words per minute, and 19 words per minute for composition.[2] In the same study, when the group was divided into \\"fast\\", \\"moderate\\", and \\"slow\\" groups, the average speeds were 40 wpm, 35 wpm, and 23 wpm, respectively.[3]\\r\\nWith the onset of the era of desktop computers, fast typing skills became much more widespread.\\r\\nAn average professional typist types usually in speeds of 50 to 80 wpm, while some positions can require 80 to 95 (usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other time-sensitive typing jobs), and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm.[4] Two-finger typists, sometimes also referred to as \\"hunt and peck\\" typists, commonly reach sustained speeds of about 37 wpm for memorized text and 27 wpm when copying text, but in bursts may be able to reach much higher speeds.[3] From the 1920s through the 1970s, typing speed (along with shorthand speed) was an important secretarial qualification and typing contests were popular and often publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools.\\r\\nThe fastest typing speed on an alphanumeric keyboard, 216 words in one minute, was achieved by Stella Pajunas in 1946 on an IBM electric.[5][6][7] As of 2005[update], writer Barbara Blackburn was the fastest alphanumerical English language typist in the world, according to The Guinness Book of World Records. Using the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard, she maintained 150 wpm for 50 minutes, and 170 wpm for shorter periods. Her top speed was 212 wpm. Current online records of sprint speeds on short text selections are 290 wpm, achieved by Guilherme Sandrini on typingzone.com and 295 wpm achieved by Kathy Chiang on TypeRacer.com. For longer passages, Sean Wrona holds the record with 174 wpm on a 50-minute test taken on hi-games.net.[8]\\r\\nStenotype keyboards enable the trained user to input text as fast as 225 wpm or faster at very high accuracy for an extended period of time, which is sufficient for real-time activities such as court reporting or closed captioning. While dropout rates are very highin some cases, only 10%[9] or even less graduatestenotype students are usually able to reach speeds of 100ÿ120 wpm within six months, which is faster than most alphanumeric typists. Guinness World Records[10] gives 360 wpm with 97.23% accuracy as the highest achieved speed using a stenotype.\\r\\nThe numeric entry or 10 key speed is a measure of one's ability to manipulate the numeric keypad found on most modern separate computer keyboards. It is used to measure speed for jobs such as data entry of number information on items such as remittance advice, bills, or checks, as deposited to lockboxes. It is measured in \\"Keystrokes per hour,\\" or KPH. Many jobs require a certain KPH, often 8,000 or 10,000.\\r\\nFor an adult population (age range 18ÿ64) the average speed of copying is 68 letters per minute (approximately 13 wpm), with the range from a minimum of 26 to a maximum of 113 letters per minute (approximately 5 to 20 wpm).[11]\\r\\nA study of police interview records showed that the highest speed fell in the range 120ÿ155 characters per minute, the highest possible limit being 190 characters per minute.[12]\\r\\nAccording to various studies the speed of handwriting of 3ÿ7 graders varies from 25 to 94 letters per minute.[13]\\r\\nUsing stenography (shorthand) methods, this rate increases greatly. Handwriting speeds up to 350 words per minute have been achieved in shorthand competitions.[14]\\r\\nWords per minute is a common metric for assessing reading speed and is often used in the context of remedial skills evaluation, as well as in the context of speed reading, where it is a controversial measure of reading performance.\\r\\nA word in this context is the same as in the context of speech.\\r\\nResearch done in 2012[15] measured the speed at which subjects read a text aloud, and found the average speed across 17 different languages to be 184I29 WPM or 863I234 CPM. However, for the languages that use the Latin or Cyrillic alphabets, the number of WPM varied, as low as 161I18 for Finnish and as high as 228I30 for English. The reason for this is different word structures in each language (longer words in such languages as Finnish and shorter words in English). However, the number of characters per minute tends to be around 1000 for all the tested languages. For the tested Asian languages that use particular writing systems (Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese) these numbers are lower.\\r\\nScientific studies have demonstrated that readingdefined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every pagefaster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye.[16]\\r\\nWhile proofreading materials, people are able to read English at 200 WPM on paper, and 180 WPM on a monitor.[17] [Those numbers from Ziefle, 1998, are for studies that used monitors prior to 1992. See Noyes & Garland 2008 for a modern tech view of equivalence.]\\r\\nAudiobooks are recommended to be 150ÿ160 words per minute, which is the range that people comfortably hear and vocalize words.[18]\\r\\nSlide presentations tend to be closer to 100ÿ125?wpm for a comfortable pace,[19] auctioneers can speak at about 250?wpm,[citation needed] and the fastest speaking policy debaters speak from 350[20] to over 500 words per minute.[21] Internet speech calculators show that various things influence words per minute including nervousness.[citation needed]\\r\\nJohn Moschitta, Jr., was listed in Guinness World Records, for a time, as the world's fastest speaker, being able to talk at 586?wpm.[22] He has since been surpassed by Steve Woodmore, who achieved a rate of 637?wpm.[23]\\r\\nMorse code uses variable length sequences of short and long duration signals (dots and dashes) to represent source information[24] e.g. sequences for the letter \\"K\\" and numeral \\"2\\" are respectively (ǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶ) and (ǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶ). This variability complicates the measurement of Morse code speed rated in words per minute.\\r\\nIt is standard practice to use two different such standard words to measure Morse code speeds in words per minute. The standard words are: \\"PARIS\\" and \\"CODEX\\". In Morse code \\"PARIS\\" has 50 dot durations, while \\"CODEX\\" has 60.\\r\\nMorse is still widely used by amateur radio operators (hams). Experienced hams routinely send Morse at 20 words per minute, using manually operated hand telegraph keys?; enthusiasts such as members of The CW Operators' Club routinely send and receive Morse code at speeds up to 60 wpm. Twenty words per minute (20wpm) represents the rough upper limit for Morse operators attempting to write down Morse code received by ear using paper and pencil. Many skilled Morse code operators can receive Morse code by ear mentally without writing down the information at speeds up to 70 wpm. To write down the Morse code information manually at speeds higher than 20 wpm it is usual for the operators to use a typewriter or computer keyboard to enable higher speed copying.\\r\\nThe fastest Morse code operator was Theodore Roosevelt McElroy copying at 75.6 wpm using a typewriter at the 1939 world championship.[25]","field3":"What is the normal typing words per minute?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"1979ÿ80 season","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"A three-point field goal (also called a three-pointer) is a field goal in a basketball game made from beyond the three-point line, a designated arc surrounding the basket. A successful attempt is worth three points, in contrast to the two points awarded for field goals made within the three-point line and the one point for each made free throw.\\r\\nThe distance from the basket to the three-point line varies by competition level: in the National Basketball Association (NBA) the arc is 23?feet 9?inches (7.24?m) from the basket; in FIBA and the WNBA (the latter uses FIBA's three-point line standard) the arc is 6.75 metres or 22?feet 1?3?4?inches from the basket; and in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) the arc is 20?feet 9?inches (6.32?m) from the basket. In the NBA and FIBA/WNBA, the three-point line becomes parallel to each sideline at the points where the arc is 3 feet (0.91?m) from each sideline; as a result the distance from the basket gradually decreases to a minimum of 22 feet (6.71?m). In the NCAA the arc is continuous for 180 around the basket. There are more variations (see main article).\\r\\nIn 3x3, a FIBA-sanctioned variant of the half-court 3-on-3 game, the \\"three-point\\" line exists, but shots from behind the line are only worth 2 points. All other shots are worth 1 point.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three-point line was first tested at the collegiate level in a 1945 NCAA game between Columbia and Fordham but it was not kept as a rule. At the direction of Abe Saperstein, the American Basketball League became the first basketball league to institute the rule in 1961. Its three-point line was a radius of 25 feet (7.62?m) from the baskets, except along the sides.[2] The Eastern Professional Basketball League followed in its 1963ÿ64 season.\\r\\nThe three-point shot later became popularized by the American Basketball Association after its introduction in the 1967ÿ68 season. ABA commissioner George Mikan stated the three-pointer \\"would give the smaller player a chance to score and open up the defense to make the game more enjoyable for the fans.\\"[3] During the 1970s, the ABA used the three-point shot, along with the slam dunk, as a marketing tool to compete with the National Basketball Association (NBA).\\r\\nIn the 1979ÿ80 season, after having tested it in the previous pre-season, the NBA adopted the three-point line despite the view of many that it was a gimmick.[4] Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics is widely credited with making the first three-point shot in NBA history on October 12, 1979. Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets also made one on the same day.\\r\\nThe sport's international governing body, FIBA, introduced the three-point line in 1984, at a distance of 6.25?m (20?ft 6?in).\\r\\nThe NCAA's Southern Conference became the first collegiate conference to use the three-point rule, adopting a 22-foot (6.71?m) line for the 1980ÿ81 season.[5][6] Ronnie Carr of Western Carolina University was the first to score a three-point field goal in college basketball history on November 29, 1980.[6][7][8] Over the following five years, NCAA conferences differed in their use of the rule and distance required for a three-pointer. The line was as close as 17?ft 9?in (5.41?m) in the Atlantic Coast Conference, and as far away as 22 feet in the Big Sky Conference.[9] Used in conference play, it was adopted by the NCAA for the 1986ÿ87 men's season at 19?ft 9?in (6.02?m), and was first used in the NCAA Tournament in 1987.[10] In the same 1986ÿ87 season, the NCAA adopted the three-pointer in women's basketball on an experimental basis, using the same 19 ft 9 in distance, and made its use mandatory beginning in 1987ÿ88.[11] In 2007, the NCAA lengthened the men's three-point distance to 20?ft 9?in (6.32?m), with the rule coming into effect at the beginning of the 2008ÿ09 season.[12] The NCAA women's three-point distance was moved to match the men's distance in 2011ÿ12.[11] American high schools, along with elementary and middle schools, adopted a 19?ft 9?in (6.02?m) line nationally in 1987, a year after the NCAA.[13] The NCAA used the FIBA three-point line (see below) in the 2018 National Invitation Tournament.[14]\\r\\nDuring the 1994ÿ95, 1995ÿ96, and 1996ÿ97 seasons, the NBA attempted to address decreased scoring by shortening the distance of the line from 23?ft 9?in (7.24?m) (22?ft (6.71?m) at the corners) to a uniform 22?ft (6.71?m) around the basket. From the 1997ÿ98 season on, the NBA reverted the line to its original distance of 23 ft 9 in (22 ft at the corners, with a 3 inch differential). Ray Allen is currently the NBA all-time leader in career made three-pointers with 2,973.[15]\\r\\nIn 2008, FIBA announced that the distance would be increased by 50?cm (19.69?in) to 6.75?m (22?ft 1?3?4?in), with the change being phased in beginning in October 2010. In December 2012, the WNBA announced that it would be using FIBA's distance, too, as of the 2013 season. The NBA has discussed adding a four-point line, according to president Rod Thorn.[16]\\r\\nIn the NBA, three-point field goals have become increasingly more frequent along the years, with effectiveness increasing slightly. The 1979-80 season had an average 2.2 three-point goals per game and 6.6 attempts (28% effectiveness). The 1989-90 season had an average 4.8 three-point goals per game and 13.7 attempts (35% effectiveness). The 2009-10 season had an average 6.4 three-point goals per game and 18.1 attempts (36% effectiveness). The 2016-17 season had an average 9.7 three-point goals per game and 27.0 attempts (36% effectiveness).[17]\\r\\nA three-point line consists of an arc at a set radius measured from the point on the floor directly below the center of the basket, and two parallel lines equidistant from each sideline extending from the nearest end line to the point at which they intersect the arc. In the NBA and FIBA standard, the arc spans the width of the court until it is a specified minimum distance from each sideline. The three-point line then becomes parallel to the sidelines from those points to the baseline. The unusual formation of the three-point line at these levels allows players some space from which to attempt a three-point shot at the corners of the court; the arc would be less than 2 feet (0.61?m) from each sideline at the corners if it was a continuous arc. In the NCAA and American high school standards, the arc spans 180 around the basket, then becomes parallel to the sidelines from the plane of the basket center to the baseline (5?feet 3?inches or 1.60 metres). The distance of the three-point line to the center of the hoop varies by level:\\r\\nA player's feet must be completely behind the three-point line at the time of the shot or jump in order to make a three-point attempt; if the player's feet are on or in front of the line, it is a two-point attempt. A player is allowed to jump from outside the line and land inside the line to make a three-point attempt, as long as the ball is released in mid-air.\\r\\nAn official raises his/her arm with three fingers extended to signal the shot attempt. If the attempt is successful, he/she raises his/her other arm with all fingers fully extended in manner similar to a football official signifying successful field goal to indicate the three-point goal. The official must recognize it for it to count as three points. Instant replay has sometimes been used, depending on league rules. The NBA,[22] WNBA, FIBA and the NCAA specifically allow replay for this purpose. In NBA, FIBA, and WNBA games, video replay does not have to occur immediately following a shot; play can continue and the officials can adjust the scoring later in the game, after reviewing the video. However, in late game situations, play may be paused pending a review.\\r\\nIf a shooter is fouled while attempting a three-pointer and subsequently misses the shot, the shooter is awarded three free-throw attempts. If a player completes a three-pointer while being fouled, the player is awarded one free-throw for a possible 4-point play. Conceivably, if a player completed a three-pointer while being fouled, and that foul was ruled as either a Flagrant 1 or a Flagrant 2 foul, the player would be awarded two free throws for a possible 5-point play.\\r\\nMajor League Lacrosse features a two-point line which forms a 15-yard (14?m) arc around the front of the goal. Shots taken from behind this line count for two points, as opposed to the standard one point.\\r\\nIn gridiron football, a standard field goal is worth three points; various professional and semi-pro leagues have experimented with four-point field goals. NFL Europe and the Stars Football League adopted a rule similar to basketball's three-point line in which an additional point was awarded for longer field goals; in both leagues any field goal of 50 yards (46?m) or more was worth four points. The Arena Football League awards four points for any successful drop kicked field goal (like the three-point shot, the drop kick is more challenging than a standard place kick, as the bounce of the ball makes a kick less predictable, and arena football also uses narrower goal posts for all kicks than the outdoor game does).\\r\\nDuring the existence of the World Hockey Association in the 1970s, there were proposals for two-point hockey goals for shots taken beyond an established distance (one proposal was a 44-foot (13.4m) arc, which would have intersected the faceoff circles), but this proposal gained little support and faded after the WHA merged with the NHL. It was widely believed that long-distance shots in hockey had little direct relation to skill (usually resulting more from goalies' vision being screened or obscured), plus with the lower scoring intrinsic to the sport a two-point goal was seen as disruptive of the structure of the game.\\r\\nThe Super Goal is a similar concept in Australian rules football, in which a 50-meter (55?yd) arc determines the value of a goal; within the arc, it is the usual 6 points, but 9 points are scored for a \\"super goal\\" scored from outside the arc. To date the super goal is only used in pre-season games and not in the season proper.[23]\\r\\nThe National Professional Soccer League II, which awarded two points for all goals except those on the power play, also used a three-point line, drawn 45 feet (14?m) from the goal. It has since been adopted by some other indoor soccer leagues.","field3":"When was the nba three point line introduced?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Charles McMahon","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Charles McMahon (May 10, 1953 ÿ April 29, 1975)[1] and Darwin Lee Judge (February 16, 1956 ÿ April 29, 1975)[2] were the last two United States servicemen killed in Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

In telephone calls to the hospital on the afternoon of April 29, the few remaining staff advised that the bodies had been evacuated; in fact the bodies were left behind.[5] Operation Frequent Wind, the American evacuation of Saigon, was completed the following day, April 30, 1975. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, through diplomatic channels, secured the return of the bodies the following year.[6]\\r\\nLance Corporal Darwin L Judge was buried with full military honors in March 1976 in Marshalltown, Iowa. There was a flag draped coffin, a Marine Honor Guard, and a rifle firing salute. The flag that covered his coffin was folded and presented to his parents. His funeral was so ignored that major and minor media did not attend the event. The lone exception was the Daily Iowan (Iowa City, Iowa). A full set of photographs of the event is available. Due to ignorance of his military funeral in March 1976, Judge was given a second Marine burial honors 25 years later through planning by Douglas Potratz, USMC MSG who served with Judge in Saigon and Ken Locke, boyhood friend and fellow Eagle Scout;[7] retired USMC Lieutenant Colonel Jim Kean, the commanding officer of the Marines during the Fall of Saigon, presented a flag to Judge's parents at a ceremony held at the Iowa Veteran's Home Vietnam War Memorial.[8] The Fall of Saigon Marines Association, a California non-profit, public-benefit corporation, was formed to honor the last two Marines to be killed in action in Vietnam. The association sponsors two $500 scholarships for Eagle Scouts attending Marshalltown High School in Marshalltown, Iowa (as a memorial to Eagle Scout Judge).[9]\\r\\nThe first U.S. casualty in Vietnam was Flying Tiger John T. Donovan who was killed on May 12, 1942, but American involvement in Vietnam was not considered official at that time and as such his name does not appear on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.[10]\\r\\nFor over 40 years the first person who died in Vietnam was in controversy. Richard B. Fitzgibbon, Jr.'s death in June 1956 was deemed to have taken place before the start of the Vietnam War. However, the family of Fitzgibbon had long lobbied to have the start date changed and their cause was taken up by U.S. Representative Ed Markey (D-MA).[11] After a high level review by the DoD and through the efforts of Fitzgibbon's family, the start date of the Vietnam war was changed to November 1, 1955.[12] The November 1955 date was chosen as the new start date because that was when the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), Vietnam was separated out from MAAG, Indochina in a reorganization into the different countries that the deployments were stationed.[13] With this new date Fitzgibbon became the first person to die in the Vietnam War, Fitzgibbon's name was added to the Vietnam Memorial Wall in 1999.[14] The former first two official casualties were U.S. Army major Dale R. Buis and Master Sergeant Chester Charles Ovnand who were killed on July 8, 1959.\\r\\nWhile McMahon and Judge were the last American ground casualties in Vietnam, they are not the last casualties of the Vietnam War (a term which also covers the U.S. involvement in Cambodia and Laos) recorded on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; those names belong to the 18 Americans killed in the Mayaguez Incident.","field3":"Who was the last american soldier killed in vietnam?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"37.8 years","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The United States is estimated to have a population of 323,127,513 as of July 1, 2016, making it the third most populous country in the world.[2] It is very urbanized, with 81% residing in cities and suburbs as of 2014 (the worldwide urban rate is 54%).[3] California and Texas are the most populous states, as the mean center of U.S. population has consistently shifted westward and southward.[4][5] New York City is the most populous city in the United States.[6]\\r\\nThe total fertility rate in the United States estimated for 2016 is 1.82 children per woman,[7][8] which is below the replacement fertility rate of approximately 2.1. The United States Census Bureau shows a population increase of 0.75% for the twelve-month period ending in July 2012. Though high by industrialized country standards, this is below the world average annual rate of 1.1%.[9]\\r\\nThere were about 125.9 million adult women in the United States in 2014. The number of men was 119.4 million. At age 85 and older, there were almost twice as many women as men (4 million vs. 2.1 million). People under 21 years of age made up over a quarter of the U.S. population (27.1%), and people age 65 and over made up one-seventh (14.5%).[10] The national median age was 37.8 years in 2015.[11]\\r\\nThe United States Census Bureau defines white people as those \\"having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.\\" It includes people who reported \\"White\\" or wrote in entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.\\"[12] Whites constitute the majority of the U.S. population, with a total of about 245,532,000 or 77.7% of the population as of 2013. Non-Hispanic whites make up 62.6% of the country's population. Despite major changes due to immigration since the 1960s, and the higher birth-rates of nonwhites, the overall current majority of American citizens are still white, and English-speaking, though regional differences exist.\\r\\nThe American population almost quadrupled during the 20th centuryat a growth rate of about 1.3% a yearfrom about 76 million in 1900 to 281 million in 2000. It reached the 200 million mark in 1968, and the 300 million mark on October 17, 2006.[13][14] Population growth is fastest among minorities as a whole, and according to the Census Bureau's estimation for 2012, 50.4% of American children under the age of 1 belonged to minority groups.[15]\\r\\nHispanic and Latino Americans accounted for 48% of the national population growth of 2.9 million between July 1, 2005, and July 1, 2006.[16] Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to provide most of the U.S. population gains in the decades ahead.[17]\\r\\nThe Census Bureau projects a U.S. population of 417 million in 2060, which is a 38% increase from 2007 (301.3 million).[18] However, the United Nations projects a U.S. population of 402 million in 2050, an increase of 32% from 2007.[19] In an official census report, it was reported that 54.4% (2,150,926 out of 3,953,593) of births in 2010 were non-Hispanic white. This represents an increase of 0.3% compared to the previous year, which was 54.1%.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1900, when the U.S. population was 76 million, there were 66.8 million Whites in the United States, representing 88% of the total population,[24] 8.8 million Black Americans, with about 90% of them still living in Southern states,[25] and slightly more than 500,000 Hispanics.[26]\\r\\nUnder the law, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965,[27] the number of first-generation immigrants living in the United States has increased,[28] from 9.6 million in 1970 to about 38 million in 2007.[29] Around a million people legally immigrated to the United States per year in the 1990s, up from 250,000 per year in the 1950s.[30] In 2009, 37% of immigrants originated in Asia, 42% in North America, and 11% in Africa.[31]\\r\\nIn 1900, non-Hispanic whites comprised almost 97% of the population of the 10 largest American cities.[32] The Census Bureau reported that minorities (including Hispanic whites) made up 50.4% of the children born in the U.S. between July 2010 and July 2011,[33] compared to 37% in 1990.[34]\\r\\nIn 2010 the state with the lowest fertility rate was Rhode Island, with a rate of 1.63, while Utah had the greatest rate with a rate of 2.45.[20] This correlates with the ages of the states' populations: Rhode Island has the ninth-oldest median age in the US39.2while Utah has the youngest29.0.[35]\\r\\nThe U.S. total fertility rate as of 2010 census is 1.931:\\r\\nOther:[36]\\r\\n(Note that ~95% of Hispanics are included as \\"white Hispanics\\" by CDC, which does not recognize the Census' \\"Some other race\\" category and counts people in that category as white.)\\r\\nSource: National Vital statistics report based on 2010 US Census data[20]\\r\\nThe most densely populated state is New Jersey (1,121/mi2 or 433/km2).

One organization specializing in analyzing gay demographic data reported, based on this count in the 2000 census and in the 2000 supplementary survey, that same-sex couples comprised between 0.99% and 1.13% of U.S. couples in 2000.[53] A 2006 report issued by The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation concluded that the number of same-sex couples in the U.S. grew from 2000 to 2005, from nearly 600,000 couples in 2000 to almost 777,000 in 2005. A 2006 UCLA study reported that 4.1% of Americans aged 18ÿ45 identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.[54]\\r\\nA 2011 report by the Institute estimated that 4 million adults identify as gay or lesbian, representing 1.7% of the population over 18. A spokesperson said that, until recently, few studies have tried to eliminate people who had occasionally undertaken homosexual behavior or entertained homosexual thoughts, from people who identified as lesbian or gay.[55] (Older estimates have varied depending on methodology and timing; see Demographics of sexual orientation for a list of studies.) The American Community Survey from the 2000 U.S. Census estimated 776,943 same-sex couple households in the country as a whole, representing about 0.5% of the population.[54]\\r\\nA report by the U.S. Census Bureau projects a decrease in the ratio of Whites between 2010 and 2050, from 79.5% to 74.0%.[57] At the same time, Non-Hispanic Whites are projected to no longer make up a majority of the population by 2042, but will remain the largest single ethnic group. In 2050 they will compose 46.3% of the population. Non-Hispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.[58]\\r\\nThe report foresees the Hispanic or Latino population rising from 16% today to 30% by 2050, the Black percentage barely rising from 12.9% to 13.1%, and Asian Americans upping their 4.6% share to 7.8%. The United States had a population of 310 million people in October 2010, and is projected to reach 400 million by 2039 and 439 million in 2050.[18][59][60][61] It is further projected that 82% of the increase in population from 2005 to 2050 will be due to immigrants and their children.[62]\\r\\nOf the nation's children in 2050, 62% are expected to be of a minority ethnicity, up from 44% today. Approximately 39% are projected to be Hispanic or Latino (up from 22% in 2008), and 38% are projected to be single-race, non-Hispanic Whites (down from 56% in 2008).[63] Racial and ethnic minorities surpassed non-Hispanic whites as the largest group of American children under 5 years old in 2015.[64]\\r\\nIn 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau projected the future censuses as follows:[18]\\r\\nThe table below is based mainly on selected data as reported to the United States Census Bureau. It only includes the voluntary self-reported membership of religious bodies with 750,000 or more.

If this current growth rate continues, by 2050, around 51% of Americans will not have a religion.[67]\\r\\nA survey conducted in 2014 by the same organization indicated that the percentage of Americans unaffiliated with a religion rose to nearly 23% of the population, up from 16% in 2007.[68]\\r\\nReligious affiliation within each state that has the largest deviation compared to the national average, 2001.\\r\\nPercentage of state populations that identify with a religion rather than \\"no religion\\", 2001.\\r\\nPlurality religion by state, 2001.

When the ages of the respondents were correlated with the expressed importance rankings, seven (some put 8 or 9) distinct cohorts became evident.\\r\\nToday the following descriptors are frequently used for these cohorts:\\r\\nSubdivided groups are present when peak boom years or inverted peak bust years are present, and may be represented by a normal or inverted bell-shaped curve (rather than a straight curve). The boom subdivided cohorts may be considered as \\"pre-peak\\" (including peak year) and \\"post-peak\\". The year 1957 was the baby boom peak with 4.3 million births and 122.7 fertility rate. Although post-peak births (such as trailing edge boomers) are in decline, and sometimes referred to as a \\"bust\\", there are still a relatively large number of births. The dearth-in-birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year, and those including and beyond, leading up to the subsequent normal birth rate. The Baby boom began around 1943 to 1946.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrom the decline in U.S. birth rates starting in 1958 and the introduction of the birth control pill in 1960, the Baby Boomer normal distribution curve is negatively skewed. The trend in birth rates from 1958 to 1961 show a tendency to end late in the decade at approximately 1969, thus returning to pre-WWII levels, with 12 years of rising and 12 years of declining birth rates. Pre-war birth rates were defined as anywhere between 1939 and 1941 by demographers such as the Taeuber's, Philip M. Hauser and William Fielding Ogburn.[93]\\r\\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[94]\\r\\nMedian ages are 37.3 years; males are 36.1 years; females are 38.5 years estimated as of 2012.\\r\\nAs of 2012, people are distributed by age as follows:\\r\\nThe growth rate is 0.76% as estimated from 2014ÿ2010 by the US Census\\r\\nThe birth rate is 12.5 births/1,000 population, estimated as of 2013. This was the lowest since records began. There were 3,957,577 births in 2013.[95]\\r\\nIn 2009, Time magazine reported that 40% of births were to unmarried women.[97] The following is a breakdown by race for unwed births: 17% Asian, 29% White, 53% Hispanics, 66% Native Americans, and 72% Black American.[98]\\r\\nThe drop in the birth rate from 2007 to 2009 is believed to be associated with the Late-2000s recession.[99]\\r\\nA study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that more than half (51 percent) of live hospital births in 2008 and 2011 were male.[100]\\r\\nPer U.S. federal government data released in March 2011, births fell 4% from 2007 to 2009, the largest drop in the U.S. for any two-year period since the 1970s.[101] Births have declined for three consecutive years, and are now 7% below the peak in 2007.[102] This drop has continued through 2010, according to data released by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics in June 2011.[103] Numerous experts have suggested that this decline is largely a reflection of unfavorable economic conditions.[104] This connection between birth rates and economic downturns partly stems from the fact that American birth rates have now fallen to levels that are comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s.[105] Teen birth rates in the U.S. are at the lowest level in U.S. history.[106] In fact, teen birth rates in the U.S. have consistently decreased since 1991 through 2011, except for a brief increase between 2005 and 2007.[106] The other aberration from this otherwise steady decline in teen birth rates is the 6% decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009.[106] Despite these years of decrease, U.S. teen birth rates are still higher than in other developed nations.[106] Racial differences prevail with teen birth and pregnancy rates as well. The American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teen birth rate.[107]\\r\\nNote: Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.[108][8] Also note that growth arrows indicate an increase or decrease in the number of births, not in the fertility rate.\\r\\nNOTE:\\r\\nAs of July 2010, it was estimated that there were 8.18 deaths/1,000 population per year.[110]\\r\\n13% of the population was foreign-born in 2009 ÿ a rise of 350% since 1970 when foreign-born people accounted for 3.7% of the population,[111] including 11.2 million illegal aliens,[112] 80% of whom come from Latin America.[113] Latin America is the largest region-of-birth group, accounting for over half (53%) of all foreign born population in US,[114] and thus is also the largest source of both legal and illegal immigration to US.[115] In 2011, there are 18.1 million naturalized citizens in the United States, accounting for 45% of the foreign-born population (40.4 million) and 6% of the total US population at the time,[116] and around 680,000 legal immigrants are naturalized annually.[117]\\r\\n4.32 people migrate per 1,000 population, estimated in 2010.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs of July 2016[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.9 percent (U3 Rate).[120]\\r\\nAs of July 2015[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 5.3 percent (U3 Rate).[121]\\r\\nAs of July 2014[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 6.2 percent (U3 Rate).[120]\\r\\nAs of April 2017[update], the U6 unemployment rate is 8.6 percent.[122] The U6 unemployment rate counts not only people without work seeking full-time employment (the more familiar U-3 rate), but also counts \\"marginally attached workers and those working part-time for economic reasons.\\" Note that some of these part-time workers counted as employed by U-3 could be working as little as an hour a week.

The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the World Cup Finals. After this, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams. Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, France and inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain with one title each.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29?billion with an estimated 715.1?million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.[1][2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n17 countries have hosted the World Cup.

Qatar are planned as hosts of the 2022 finals, and 2026 will be a joint hosted finals between Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to have hosted games in three different finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England,[5] which ended in a 0ÿ0 draw. The first international tournament, the inaugural British Home Championship, took place in 1884.[6] As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics (however, the IOC has retroactively upgraded their status to official events), and at the 1906 Intercalated Games.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, football became an official competition. Planned by The Football Association (FA), England's football governing body, the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the England national amateur football team) won the gold medals. They repeated the feat at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, Sir Thomas Lipton organised the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as The First World Cup,[9] and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur side from County Durham, to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a \\"world football championship for amateurs\\", and took responsibility for managing the event.[10] This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, contested by Egypt and 13 European teams, and won by Belgium.[11] Uruguay won the next two Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928. Those were also the first two open world championships, as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the success of the Olympic football tournaments, FIFA, with President Jules Rimet as the driving force, again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam decided to stage a world championship itself.[12] With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country of the inaugural World Cup tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously on 13 July 1930, and were won by France and the USA, who defeated Mexico 4ÿ1 and Belgium 3ÿ0 respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by Lucien Laurent of France.[13] In the final, Uruguay defeated Argentina 4ÿ2 in front of 93,000 people in Montevideo, and became the first nation to win the World Cup.[14] After the creation of the World Cup, FIFA and the IOC disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the 1932 Summer Olympics.[15] Olympic football returned at the 1936 Summer Olympics, but was now overshadowed by the more prestigious World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the 1934 World Cup and all North and South American nations except Brazil and Cuba boycotted the 1938 tournament. Brazil was the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and 1946 competitions, which Germany and Brazil sought to host,[16] were cancelled due to World War II and its aftermath.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was the first to include British participants. British teams withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football,[17] but rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation.[18] The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again after defeating the host nation Brazil, in the match called \\"Maracanazo\\" (Portuguese: Maracana?o).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the tournaments between 1934 and 1978, 16 teams competed in each tournament, except in 1938, when Austria was absorbed into Germany after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when India, Scotland, and Turkey withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams.[19] Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: USA, semi-finalists in 1930; Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in 1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tournament was expanded to 24 teams in 1982,[20] and then to 32 in 1998,[21] also allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals: Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1986; Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; South Korea, finishing in fourth place in 2002; Senegal, along with USA, both quarter-finalists in 2002; Ghana, quarter-finalists in 2010; and Costa Rica, quarter-finalists in 2014. Nevertheless, European and South American teams continue to dominate, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2018 were all from Europe or South America and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo hundred teams entered the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification rounds; 198 nations attempted to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, while a record 204 countries entered qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2013, Sepp Blatter spoke of guaranteeing the Caribbean Football Union's region a position in the World Cup.[23] In the edition of 25 October 2013 of the FIFA Weekly Blatter wrote that: \\"From a purely sporting perspective, I would like to see globalisation finally taken seriously, and the African and Asian national associations accorded the status they deserve at the FIFA World Cup. It cannot be that the European and South American confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the World Cup.\\"[24] Those two remarks suggested to commentators that Blatter could be putting himself forward for re-election to the FIFA Presidency.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the magazine's publication, Blatter's would-be opponent for the FIFA Presidency, UEFA President Michel Platini, responded that he intended to extend the World Cup to 40 national associations, increasing the number of participants by eight. Platini said that he would allocate an additional berth to UEFA, two to the Asian Football Confederation and the Confederation of African Football, two shared between CONCACAF and CONMEBOL, and a guaranteed place for the Oceania Football Confederation.[26] Platini was clear about why he wanted to expand the World Cup. He said: \\"[The World Cup is] not based on the quality of the teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup?... but it's a good compromise.?... It's a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2016 FIFA president Gianni Infantino stated his support for a 48-team World Cup in 2026.[27] On 10 January 2017, FIFA confirmed the 2026 World Cup will have 48 finalist teams.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy May 2015, the games were under a particularly dark cloud because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights (rigged bids) for FIFA games,[29] with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150?million over 24 years. In late May, the U.S. Justice Department announced a 47-count indictment with charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people. Arrests of over a dozen FIFA officials were made since that time, particularly on 29 May and 3 December.[30] By the end of May 2015, a total of nine FIFA officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption. At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced he would relinquish his position in February 2016.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 June 2015 Chuck Blazer while co-operating with the FBI and the Swiss authorities admitted that he and the other members of FIFA's then-executive committee were bribed in order to promote the 1998 and 2010 World Cups.[32] On 10 June 2015 Swiss authorities seized computer data from the offices of Sepp Blatter.[33] The same day, FIFA postponed the bidding process for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in light of the allegations surrounding bribery in the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. Then-secretary general Jr?me Valcke stated, \\"Due to the situation, I think it's nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being.\\"[34] On 28 October 2015, Blatter and FIFA VP Michel Platini, a potential candidate for presidency, were suspended for 90 days; both maintained their innocence in statements made to the news media.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 December 2015 two FIFA vice-presidents were arrested on suspicion of bribery in the same Zurich hotel where seven FIFA officials had been arrested in May.[36] An additional 16 indictments by the U.S. Department of Justice were announced on the same day.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn equivalent tournament for women's football, the FIFA Women's World Cup, was first held in 1991 in China.[38] The women's tournament is smaller in scale and profile than the men's, but is growing; the number of entrants for the 2007 tournament was 120, more than double that of 1991.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMen's football has been included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932. Unlike many other sports, the men's football tournament at the Olympics is not a top-level tournament, and since 1992, an under-23 tournament with each team allowed three over-age players.[40] Women's football made its Olympic debut in 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FIFA Confederations Cup is a tournament held one year before the World Cup at the World Cup host nation(s) as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming World Cup. It is contested by the winners of each of the six FIFA confederation championships, along with the FIFA World Cup champion and the host country.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nFIFA also organises international tournaments for youth football (FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup), club football (FIFA Club World Cup), and football variants such as futsal (FIFA Futsal World Cup) and beach soccer (FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup). The latter three do not have a women's version, although a FIFA Women's Club World Cup has been proposed.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup is held the year before each Women's World Cup and both tournaments are awarded in a single bidding process. The U-20 tournament serves as a dress rehearsal for the larger competition.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy was awarded to the World Cup winning team. It was originally simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1970, a new trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven countries, evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy is 36?cm (14.2?in) high, made of solid 18 carat (75%) gold and weighs 6.175?kg (13.6?lb).[45] The base contains two layers of semi-precious malachite while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since 1974.[45] The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: \\"The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory.\\"[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently. World Cup winners retain the trophy only until the post-match celebration is finished. They are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original immediately afterwards.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, all members (players, coaches, and managers) of the top three teams receive medals with an insignia of the World Cup Trophy; winners' (gold), runners-up' (silver), and third-place (bronze). In the 2002 edition, fourth-place medals were awarded to hosts South Korea. Before the 1978 tournament, medals were only awarded to the eleven players on the pitch at the end of the final and the third-place match. In November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals.[48][49][50]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the second World Cup in 1934, qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament.[51] They are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, and Europe), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental play-offs. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the 2010 World Cup.[52] From the 1938 World Cup onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the 2006 FIFA World Cup onward, requiring the champions to qualify. Brazil, winners in 2002, were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current final tournament has been used since 1998 and features 32 national teams competing over the course of a month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: the group stage followed by the knockout stage.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are seeded, including the hosts, with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the FIFA World Rankings and/or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups.[55] The other teams are assigned to different \\"pots\\", usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since 1998, constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach group plays a round-robin tournament, in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. This means that a total of six matches are played within a group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams.[57] The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one considers all possible outcomes (win, draw, loss) for all six matches in a group, there are 729 (= 36) outcome combinations possible. However, 207 of these combinations lead to ties between the second and third places. In such case, the ranking among these teams is determined as follows:[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe knockout stage is a single-elimination tournament in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the round of 16 (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 January 2017, FIFA approved a new format, the 48-team World Cup (to accommodate more teams), which consists of 16 groups of three teams each, with two teams qualifying from each group, to form a round of 32 knockout stage, to be implemented by 2026.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing.[60] The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1958 FIFA World Cup, to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the Americas and Europe, which continued until the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosted jointly by South Korea and Japan, was the first one held in Asia, and the first tournament with multiple hosts.[62] South Africa became the first African nation to host the World Cup in 2010. The 2014 FIFA World Cup was hosted by Brazil, the first held in South America since Argentina 1978,[63] and was the first occasion where consecutive World Cups were held outside Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Council. This is done under an exhaustive ballot system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a \\"Hosting Agreement\\" from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the World Cup is usually made six or seven years in advance of the tournament. However, there have been occasions where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the same time, as was the case for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar, with Qatar becoming the first Middle Eastern country to host the tournament.[64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament is rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018.[66] This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2026 FIFA World Cup was chosen to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, marking the first time a World Cup has been shared by three host nations.[68] The 2026 tournament will be the biggest World Cup ever held, with 48 teams playing 80 matches. Sixty matches will take place in the US, including all matches from the quarter-finals onward, while Canada and Mexico will host 10 games each.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix of the eight champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland, the exceptions being Brazil, who finished as runners-up after losing the deciding match on home soil in 1950 and lost their semi-final against Germany in 2014, and Spain, which reached the second round on home soil in 1982. England (1966) won its only title while playing as a host nation. Uruguay (1930), Italy (1934), Argentina (1978) and \\r\\nFrance (1998) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again, while Germany (1974) won their second title on home soil.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther nations have also been successful when hosting the tournament. Switzerland (quarter-finals 1954), Sweden (runners-up in 1958), Chile (third place in 1962), South Korea (fourth place in 2002), and Mexico (quarter-finals in 1970 and 1986) all have their best results when serving as hosts. So far, South Africa (2010) has been the only host nation to fail to advance beyond the first round.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\n The best-attended single match, shown in the last three columns, has been the final in half of the 20 World Cups as of 2014. Another match or matches drew more attendance than the final in 1930, 1938, 1958, 1962, 1970ÿ1982, 1990 and 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Cup was first televised in 1954 and is now the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup is estimated to be 26.29?billion.[1] 715.1?million individuals watched the final match of this tournament (a ninth of the entire population of the planet). The 2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into groups, was watched by 300 million viewers.[73] The World Cup attracts many sponsors such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Adidas. For these companies and many more, being a sponsor strongly impacts their global brands. Host countries typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the month-long event.\\r\\nThe governing body of the sport, FIFA, generated $4.8?billion in revenue from the 2014 tournament.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach FIFA World Cup since 1966 has its own mascot or logo. World Cup Willie, the mascot for the 1966 competition, was the first World Cup mascot.[75] World Cups have also featured official match balls specially designed for each tournament.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Cup even has a statistically significant effect on birth rates, the male/female sex ratio of newborns, and heart attacks in nations whose national teams are competing.[77][78][79]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all, 79 nations have played in at least one World Cup.[83] Of these, eight national teams have won the World Cup, and they have added stars to their badges, with each star representing a World Cup victory. (Uruguay, however, choose to display four stars on their badge, representing their two gold medals at the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics and their two World Cup titles in 1930 and 1950).\\r\\n\\r\\nWith five titles, Brazil are the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have played in every World Cup (21) to date.[84] Brazil were also the first team to win the World Cup for the third (1970), fourth (1994) and fifth (2002) time. Italy (1934 and 1938) and Brazil (1958 and 1962) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles. West Germany (1982ÿ1990) and Brazil (1994ÿ2002) are the only nations to appear in three consecutive World Cup finals. Germany has made the most top-four finishes (13), medals (12), as well as the most finals (8).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by teams from the UEFA (Europe) and CONMEBOL (South America) confederations. European nations have won twelve titles, while South American have won nine. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: United States (North, Central America and Caribbean) in 1930 and South Korea (Asia) in 2002. The best result of an African team is reaching the quarter-finals: Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010. Only one Oceanian qualifier, Australia in 2006, has advanced to the second round.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the only teams to win a World Cup outside their continental confederation; Brazil came out victorious in Europe (1958), North America (1970 and 1994) and Asia (2002). Argentina won a World Cup in North America in 1986, while Spain won in Africa in 2010. In 2014, Germany became the first European team to win in the Americas. Only on five occasions have consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent, and currently it is the first time with four champions in a row from the same continental confederation. Italy and Brazil successfully defended their titles in 1938 and 1962 respectively, while Italy's triumph in 2006 has been followed by wins for Spain in 2010, Germany in 2014 and France in 2018. Currently, it is also the first time that one of the currently winning continents (Europe) is ahead of the other (South America) by more than one championship.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of each World Cup, awards are presented to the players and teams for accomplishments other than their final team positions in the tournament. There are currently six awards:[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn All-Star Team consisting of the best players of the tournament has also been announced for each tournament since 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree players share the record for playing in the most World Cups; Mexico's Antonio Carbajal (1950ÿ1966) and Rafael Mrquez (2002-2018); and Germany's Lothar Matth?us (1982ÿ1998) all played in five tournaments.[91] Matth?us has played the most World Cup matches overall, with 25 appearances.[92] Brazil's Djalma Santos (1954ÿ1962), West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer (1966ÿ1974) and Germany's Philipp Lahm (2006ÿ2014) are the only players to be named to three Finals All-Star Teams.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiroslav Klose of Germany (2002ÿ2014) is the all-time top scorer at the finals, with 16 goals. He broke Ronaldo of Brazil's record of 15 goals (1998ÿ2006) during the 2014 semi-final match against Brazil. West Germany's Gerd Mller (1970ÿ1974) is third, with 14 goals.[94] The fourth placed goalscorer, France's Just Fontaine, holds the record for the most goals scored in a single World Cup; all his 13 goals were scored in the 1958 tournament.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals.[48] This made Brazil's Pel the only player to have won three World Cup winners' medals (1958, 1962, and 1970, although he did not play in the 1962 final due to injury),[96] with 20 other players who have won two winners' medals. Seven players have collected all three types of World Cup medals (winners', runner- ups', and third-place); five players were from West Germany's squad of 1966ÿ1974 including Franz Beckenbauer, Jrgen Grabowski, Horst-Dieter H?ttges, Sepp Maier and Wolfgang Overath (1966ÿ1974), Italy's Franco Baresi (1982, 1990, 1994) and the most recent has been Miroslav Klose of Germany (2002ÿ2014) with four consecutive medals.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrazil's Mrio Zagallo, West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer and France's Didier Deschamps are the only people to date to win the World Cup as both player and head coach. Zagallo won in 1958 and 1962 as a player and in 1970 as head coach.[98] Beckenbauer won in 1974 as captain and in 1990 as head coach,[99] and Deschamps repeated the feat in 2018, after having won in 1998 as captain.[100] Italy's Vittorio Pozzo is the only head coach to ever win two World Cups (1934 and 1938).[101] All World Cup-winning head coaches were natives of the country they coached to victory.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the national teams, Germany and Brazil have played the most World Cup matches (109), Germany appeared in the most finals (8), semi-finals (13), quarter-finals (16), while Brazil has appeared in the most World Cups (21), has the most wins (73) and has scored the most goals (229).[103][104] The two teams have played each other twice in the World Cup, in the 2002 final and in the 2014 semi-final.[105]","field3":"How many games in each world cup group?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"made from soshoni","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The Shoshone or Shoshoni (/?o???o?ni?/?(?listen) or /????o?ni?/?(?listen)) are a Native American tribe with four large cultural/linguistic divisions:\\r\\nThey traditionally speak the Shoshoni language, part of the Numic languages branch of the large Uto-Aztecan language family. The Shoshone were sometimes called the Snake Indians by neighboring tribes and early American explorers.[2]\\r\\nTheir peoples have become members of federally recognized tribes throughout their traditional areas of settlement, often colocated with the Paiute and Washoe peoples of the Great Basin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"Shoshone\\" comes from Sosoni, a Shoshone word for high-growing grasses. Some neighboring tribes call the Shoshone \\"Grass House People,\\" based on their traditional homes made from soshoni.

Speakers are scattered from central Nevada to central Wyoming.[1]\\r\\nThe largest numbers of Shoshoni speakers (including children) live on the federally recognized Duck Valley Indian Reservation, located on the border of Nevada and Idaho; and Goshute Reservation in Utah. Idaho State University also offers Shoshoni-language classes.[1]\\r\\nThe Shoshone are a Native American tribe, who originated in the western Great Basin and spread north and east into present-day Idaho and Wyoming. By 1500, some Eastern Shoshone had crossed the Rocky Mountains into the Great Plains. After 1750, warfare and pressure from the Blackfoot, Crow, Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho pushed Eastern Shoshone south and westward. Some of them moved as far south as Texas, emerging as the Comanche by 1700.[2]\\r\\nAs more European-American settlers migrated west, tensions rose with the indigenous people over competition for territory and resources. Wars occurred throughout the second half of the 19th century. The Northern Shoshone, led by Chief Pocatello, fought during the 1860s with settlers in Idaho (where the city Pocatello was named for him). As more settlers encroached on Shoshone hunting territory, the natives raided farms and ranches for food, and attacked immigrants.\\r\\nThe warfare resulted in the Bear River Massacre (1863), when US forces attacked and killed an estimated 410 Northwestern Shoshone, who were at their winter encampment. A large number of the dead were civilians, including women and children, deliberately killed by the soldiers. This was the highest number of deaths which the Shoshone suffered at the hands of United States forces.\\r\\nAllied with the Bannock, to whom they were related, the Shoshone fought against the United States in the Snake War from 1864 to 1868. They fought US forces together in 1878 in the Bannock War. In 1876, by contrast, the Shoshone fought alongside the U.S. Army in the Battle of the Rosebud against their traditional enemies, the Lakota and Cheyenne.\\r\\nIn 1879 a band of approximately 300 Eastern Shoshone (known as \\"Sheepeaters\\") became involved in the Sheepeater Indian War. It was the last Indian war fought in the Pacific Northwest region of the present-day United States.\\r\\nIn 1911 a small group of Bannock under a leader named Mike Daggett, also known as \\"Shoshone Mike,\\" killed four ranchers in Washoe County, Nevada.[3] The settlers formed a posse and went out after the Native Americans. They caught up with the Bannock band on February 26, 1911 and killed eight. They lost one man of the posse, Ed Hogle.[4] The posse captured three children and a woman.\\r\\nA rancher donated the partial remains of three adult males, two adult females, two adolescent males, and three children (believed to be Shoshone Mike and his family, according to contemporary accounts) to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC for study. In 1994, the institution repatriated the remains to the Fort Hall Idaho Shoshone-Bannock Tribe.[5]\\r\\nIn 2008 the Northwestern Shoshone acquired the site of the Bear River Massacre and some surrounding land. They wanted to protect the holy land and to build a memorial to the massacre, the largest their nation had suffered. \\"In partnership with the American West Heritage Center and state leaders in Idaho and Utah, the tribe has developed public/private partnerships to advance tribal cultural preservation and economic development goals.\\" They have become a leader in developing tribal renewable energy.[6]\\r\\nIn 1845 the estimated population of Northern and Western Shoshone was 4,500, much reduced after they had suffered infectious disease epidemics and warfare. The completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 was followed by European-American immigrants arriving in unprecedented numbers in the territory.\\r\\nIn 1937 the Bureau of Indian Affairs counted 3,650 Northern Shoshone and 1,201 Western Shoshone. As of the 2000 census, some 12,000 persons identified as Shoshone.\\r\\nShoshone people are divided into traditional bands based both on their homelands and primary food sources. These include:","field3":"What kind of home did the shoshone live in?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Campfire Smores company in the 1920s","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"A s'more is a traditional nighttime campfire treat popular in the United States and Canada, consisting of a fire-roasted marshmallow and a layer of chocolate sandwiched between two pieces of graham cracker.[1] National S'mores Day is celebrated annually on August 10.[2] The Guinness World Record for number of people making s'mores at one time was 423, set April 21, 2016, in Huntington Beach, California.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nS'more is a contraction of the phrase \\"some more\\".

A marshmallow, usually held by a metal or wooden skewer, is heated over the fire until it is golden brown. The warm marshmallow is then added on top of half of a graham cracker and a piece of chocolate. The second half of the cracker is then added on top.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious confections containing graham cracker, chocolate, and marshmallow are often sold as some derivative of a s'mores, but they are not necessarily heated or served in the same shape as the traditional s'mores.

Long held parliamentary procedure that required immediate consideration of no-confidence motions intended to prevent illegitimate governments from passing laws was ignored by the speaker. Amidst a lot of protest in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Parliament of India), the bill was introduced by the speaker Meira Kumar at 12:00?pm on 13 February 2014.[10] During this time, there was a lot of shouting of slogans and disruption of proceedings by the Seemandhra (non-Telangana) MPs in the parliament who were determined to stop the bill. The Indian National Congress party MP's attacked the anti-Telangana protestors, and the MP Lagadapati Rajagopal used pepper spray in the parliament. Later he said he was attacked by some Congress MPs from other states and had to use it in self-defence. The parliament was then adjourned at 12:05?pm to 02:00?pm.[11]\\r\\nThe leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said she did not know if the bill was introduced.[12] On 18 February 2014, the Telangana Bill was passed by the Voice Vote in the Lok Sabha with support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while the live telecast of the House was cut off and the doors and galleries were sealed.[13][14][15] The Seemandhra leaders accused the United Progressive Alliance government of having taken it up for electoral gains and said it was a \\"black day\\" for the Indian parliament.[16]\\r\\nOn 20 February, the Telangana bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha (the higher house of parliament) with support from the BJP.

Non-Telangana MLAs opposed the bill. This was the first instance a state was re-organized after a state clearly expressed an opinion against the re-organization in Indian history.\\r\\nNine petitions were filed in the Supreme Court of India requesting a stay of the tabling of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill in parliament. The court rejected the pleas saying, \\"We do not think this is the appropriate stage for us to interfere\\". They would only consider the petition if the bill was passed in parliament.[24] But the court issued notices to the centre regarding the issue on 7 March 2014. The apex court would take up the issue on 5 May 2014.[25] The next hearing in the Supreme Court was scheduled for 20 August 2014[26] One petitioner approached the Supreme Court praying that the parliament does not have the power either under Articles 3, 4(2) or any other provision of the Constitution of India to divide a state except by an appropriate amendment of the Constitution under article 368 and with the unanimous consent of the people of the affected State or States.[27] While invoking Articles 2 & 3, the deemed constitutional amendment provision under article 4 (2) of the constitution bypassing Article 368 was said to be invalid after the 24th amendment in 1971.[28][dubious ÿ discuss] The law ministry of the union government considered bringing appropriate amendments (including constitutional amendments) to the Act to bring legality to it.[29]\\r\\nThe common high court of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states stated that the division of the high court located at Hyderabad can only be done with the formation of separate high court for Andhra Pradesh located in that state as per section 31 of the Act. A separate high court for Telangana can not be formed by dividing the present common high court as the existing high court at Hyderabad would become high court of Telangana state after the formation of one for Andhra Pradesh.[30]\\r\\nOn the applicability of the section 47 of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, Supreme Court in its judgement clarified the manner the financial assets and liabilities of undivided state departments and corporations are to be shared between the new states.[31][32] In an effort to avoid the huge financial burden to finance the creation of many institutions in the truncated AP state, the affidavit of central government clinched the dispute against the Telangana state[33] AP state also decided to approach Supreme Court regarding the discriminatory sharing of commercial taxes income and refunds under sections 50, 51 and 56 of the act. The state is weary of centres inaction for a long time to amend these sections such that AP state would not loose INR 36 billions.[34]\\r\\nThe bill was introduced on 5 December 2013, the first day of the winter session in the Legislative Assembly of Andhra Pradesh.

The Boards would be responsible for the administration, regulation and maintenance of the head works of the dams, reservoirs or head works of canals, as notified by the Government of India on Krishna and Godavari rivers, to implement all the awards made by the Tribunals. The Boards would be responsible for making an appraisal of proposals for construction of new projects on Krishna and Godavari rivers and give technical clearance.[38] While not agreeing for the fresh water allocation of Krishna river among all the four riparian states, the extented Justice Brijesh Kumar tribunal ruled that the water sharing between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states would be finalised project wise from the water allocations made to earstwhile Andhra Pradesh state by earlier Bachawat tribunal. It also stated that the primary reason for the division of the erstwhile state was to fulfil the political and democratic aspirations of the people of Telangana region, and not inequitable sharing of water.[39]\\r\\nThe Governor shall have special responsibility to the security of life, liberty and property of all those who reside in the common capital of Hyderabad.

The Bishops of Ely continued to oversee the chapel which was used for Anglican worship after the English Reformation.\\r\\nIn 1576 a lease on a portion of the house and lands surrounding the chapel was granted by Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely, to Sir Christopher Hatton, a favourite of Elizabeth I. The rent was S10, ten loads of hay and one red rose per year, a small enough sum to give rise to suspicion that Elizabeth had put pressure on the bishop. Hatton borrowed extensively from the crown to pay for refurbishment and upkeep of the property. During his tenancy, the crypt was used as a tavern.\\r\\nEly Palace is mentioned in two of Shakespeare's plays, Richard II and Richard III.\\r\\nIn 1620, the upper church was granted to Count Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, to use as a private chapel and considered to be on Spanish soil. Roman Catholic worship, still illegal in England, was allowed in the church. Two years later, during a diplomatic dispute between England and Spain, Gondomar was recalled to Spain and use of the chapel was not given to his successor.\\r\\nMatthew Wren, Bishop of Ely from 1638 (and uncle of Christopher Wren), worshipped at St Etheldreda's chapel before his imprisonment in 1641.\\r\\nIn 1642, the palace and church was requisitioned by Parliament for use as a prison and hospital during the English Civil War. During Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth (1649ÿ1660) most of the palace was demolished and the gardens were destroyed.\\r\\nIn 1772, an Act of Parliament allowed the Bishops of Ely to sell the property to the Crown.

The chapel was extensively refurbished in the Georgian style before it re-opened in 1786.\\r\\nIn 1820 the chapel was taken over by the National Society for the Education of the Poor who hoped to convert the Catholic Irish immigrants then settling in the area. A short time later the church closed.\\r\\nIn 1836, Ely Chapel was reopened by the Reverend Alexander D'Arblay (son of Fanny Burney) as a place of Anglican worship but he died the following year. In 1843, the church was leased by Welsh Anglicans with services celebrated in the Welsh language.[2] The chapel was put up for auction in 1874 and purchased for S5,400 by the Roman Catholic convert Father William Lockhart of the Rosminian order.\\r\\nUnder Lockhart's direction, the crypt and upper church were restored by George Gilbert Scott to their original 13th-century designs. John Francis Bentley designed a choir screen incorporating a confessional, an organ and a choir gallery. The royal coat of arms, added during the reign of Charles I, was removed to the cloister. The church received a relic from the Duke of Norfolk: a piece of St Etheldreda's hand which is kept in a jewel cask to the right of the high altar.\\r\\nThe restoration was completed in 1878 and a Roman Catholic Mass was celebrated in St Ethelreda's for the first time in over 200 years. The upper church was reopened in 1879 on the Feast of St Etheldreda (23 June).\\r\\nFor many years, St Etheldreda's church was the oldest Roman Catholic church building in England, but since 1971 it has been surpassed by the 12th century church of Ss Leonard & Mary in Malton, North Yorkshire.\\r\\nIn 1925, the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments scheduled the chapel as an ancient monument.\\r\\nIn May 1941, during the Blitz, the church was hit by a bomb that tore a hole in the roof and destroyed the Victorian stained glass windows. It took seven years to repair the structural damage.\\r\\nIn 1952, new stained glass by Joseph Nuttgens was installed in the east window. It features the Trinity, the evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, as well as the Virgin Mary, St Joseph, St Bridget of Kildare and St Etheldreda. The stained glass windows in the south wall depict scenes from the Old Testament, and the ones in the north wall shows scene from the New Testament.\\r\\nIn the 1960s, two groups of four statues of English Catholic martyrs from the time of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I were installed along the north and south walls.

The mall, which opened in 1963, consisted of two distinct buildings known as The Plaza and The Court until August 2016, when a major expansion was completed and the two buildings were finally connected to create one massive shopping mall.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King of Prussia Mall is located in the community of King of Prussia in Upper Merion Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, 20 miles (32?km) northwest of Philadelphia. The mall is near the convergence of four major highways: the Schuylkill Expressway (Interstate 76), the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76/Interstate 276), U.S. Route 202, and U.S. Route 422.[5][6] The mall is located northeast of the Schuylkill Expressway and south of the Pennsylvania Turnpike on the north side of US 202 between Gulph Road to the southwest and Allendale Road to the northeast, with Mall Boulevard providing access to and running through the mall grounds between Gulph Road and US 202. Mall Boulevard passes under a portion of the shopping mall. Ramps to and from the westbound direction of the Schuylkill Expressway connect to Mall Boulevard.[5][7] Six SEPTA Suburban Division bus routes serve the King of Prussia Mall at the King of Prussia Transit Center. These bus routes provide service to West Chester, the Exton Transportation Center at the Exton Square Mall, the Norristown Transportation Center, Phoenixville, the 69th Street Transportation Center, Center City Philadelphia, Chesterbrook, Valley Forge, and Limerick.[8]\\r\\nThe mall has several outparcels, and several luxury and affordable hotels are nearby.[7] Among the outparcels is the Overlook at King of Prussia shopping center, which consists of a United Artists Theatres, Saks Off 5th, Best Buy, and an iFLY indoor skydiving center.[9] Lockheed Martin also has a campus overlooking the mall area.[7] Also located nearby is the King of Prussia Town Center, a lifestyle center that consists of Wegmans, multiple other big-box retailers, and a downtown area with dining, retail, and service establishments and a Town Square.[10][11] The town center is part of the Village at Valley Forge, a 122-acre mixed-use development under construction that consists of retail, apartments, townhouses, condominiums, office space, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Specialty Care and Surgery Center.[10][12]\\r\\nKing of Prussia Mall is anchored by Nordstrom, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale's, Lord & Taylor, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Primark and a diverse merchant mix of over 400 stores, including a collection of luxury retailers. The mall is managed by Simon Property Group of Indianapolis, who owns 97%. It is also the sole outpost in Philadelphia for a number of high-end stores. The mall has annual sales of $1.1 billion.[1] A selection of international dining options are available at four food courts and in over 40 casual and fine dining establishments.[6] The mall is a prominent tourist destination in the Philadelphia area, with an estimated 20% of visitors as tourists.[2] The King of Prussia Mall attracts 22 million visitors annually.[1] Several nearby hotels offer mall tourist packages, which typically include mall gift cards. The mall employs over 7,000 people.[citation needed] Due to the mall's size, several retailers rent more than one space.[13]\\r\\nA covered outdoor walkway, which features an array of plants, benches, and speakers playing jazz music, connects Macy's & Neiman Marcus. The Eastern portion of the mall (originally known as the Court) has two anchor stores, Macy's and Bloomingdale's. It originally had a third anchor, Abraham & Straus, which sold its store in 1988 to Strawbridge and Clothier, which subsequently relocated to the former Wanamaker location at The Plaza in 1996 upon its acquisition by May Department Stores Co. Its spot was redeveloped as the shopping complex's newest section, the Pavilion at King of Prussia. Stores in this section include a double-level Urban Outfitters, Old Navy, and The Cheesecake Factory. One of the complex's four food courts is also located on the lower level just past Bloomingdales[citation needed]\\r\\nThe mall was originally developed by the Kravco company. The Plaza at King of Prussia, the oldest portion of the complex, opened in 1963 as a modest open-air shopping mall anchored by JCPenney, discount department store E. J. Korvette, and an Acme \\"A-Frame\\" style supermarket. The Plaza prospered and by the late 1970s had become a partially enclosed super-regional mall anchored by department stores JCPenney, Gimbels, and Wanamaker's. The Wanamaker's store opened in 1965 in what had been an amphitheater.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy the late 1970s, The Plaza consisted of a small, fully enclosed section (connecting the three department stores) and a sprawling outdoor mall (featuring Woolworth's and Acme Markets). It was around this time Kravco noticed a demand for more upscale shopping in the northwest Philadelphia market. The company embarked on a second mall, The Court at King of Prussia, to be constructed across the street from The Plaza. The Court opened in 1981 as a fully enclosed mall anchored by department stores Bamberger's (later in 1986 to become Macy's), Bloomingdale's, and Abraham & Straus (A&S). In addition, Sears was added to The Plaza, relocating from Norristown. Sears was built as a \\"store of the future\\" and was completed along with an expansion of the multi-level portion of the Plaza.[14] The Garden Food Court was part of this expansion. Shoppers also said goodbye to inclement weather as the outdoor portion of The Plaza was enclosed. For the first time, King of Prussia visitors were inside all the time.\\r\\nThrough the 1980s, The Plaza sported such stores as Woolworth's, Herman's World of Sporting Goods, and a Lionel \\"Kiddie City\\" toy store. The Woolworth's store closed in 1993. The Plaza also featured two 1980s style video arcades, each named Spaceport, and the RKO Stanley Warner (later Sam Eric, and then United Artists Plaza) movie theater which, in an era before multiplexes, had only one extra large 7m screen. This theatre was later split in half to add a second screen.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy the early 1990s, demand for luxury goods had grown across the nation and many upscale retailers were in a growth mode. Lord & Taylor, Neiman Marcus, and Nordstrom were all looking for new locations in the area, and Kravco didn't want any of them to land at a competing mall. The company's dilemma, though, was that The Court was on a small piece of land and couldn't expand, while The Plaza was too downscale for these stores. Kravco decided to embark on an ambitious campaign to almost completely rebuild The Plaza to make it just as attractive to upscale retailers as The Court and to begin marketing the two malls as a single entity (a pedestrian bridge and walkway connecting the malls was constructed around this time, though there have always been informal passageways from one to the other). The former Acme Markets location was demolished during this project; beforehand it moved a bit down the road into a new building, with a strip mall including a Tower Records shop (since closed).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe new Plaza is fully enclosed and has two levels throughout. Lord & Taylor opened in the fall of 1995, while Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom opened in the spring of 1996. Upscale stores at The Plaza are clustered in the southern end of the mall near Lord & Taylor, Neiman Marcus, and Nordstrom, while middle-market stores remain clustered in the northern end of the mall near the former JCPenney and Sears anchor stores. The Court now contains a mix of upscale stores and middle-market stores.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe anchor lineup at both malls changed during the 1990s as the industry consolidated. Stern's, which had replaced Gimbels, left and JCPenney moved into its old space. John Wanamaker was acquired by May Department Stores, which rebranded all Wanamaker's as Hecht's, their Baltimore-Washington regional nameplate. Abraham & Straus was consolidated with Macy's and Strawbridge & Clothier briefly took its place at The Court. Soon after, May acquired Strawbridge & Clothier, rebranded it as simply Strawbridge's, and merged it with Hecht's Philadelphia operations. The Hecht's (former John Wanamaker) at The Plaza became a Strawbridge's and the Strawbridge's (former Abraham & Straus) at The Court closed. The mall even featured an outlet of the popular New York City toy company FAO Schwarz, complete with a giant teddy bear, before hard financial times forced it to close in 2004.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe growth of large-format specialty retailers in the 1990s led to the early 2000s conversion of the former Strawbridge's store at The Court into The Pavilion at King of Prussia, which might be considered the \\"third mall\\" at King of Prussia. The Pavilion connects directly to The Court (though not originally owned by Kravco, it was later acquired and is considered by many as an expansion of the Court).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe mall served as the home of the Philadelphia Freedoms tennis team of World TeamTennis in 2008 and 2009. Whenever a tennis event was to occur, a temporary tennis stadium that seated 3,000 was constructed in the parking lot of the Bloomingdale's anchor store. Eventually, the Freedoms left for The Pavilion at Villanova University in 2010.[15]\\r\\nIn 2011, Simon increased its ownership of the King of Prussia Mall from 12.4 percent to 96 percent, buying Lend Lease's 50 percent ownership of the mall. Lend Lease had bought its stake in the mall in 1996, with Kravco, Simon, and three family trusts owning the remaining 50 percent at the time.[16]\\r\\nIn January 2014, it was announced that Sears would sublease some of its space to Dick's Sporting Goods.[17] Sears would be closing this location in early December 2014. It was announced that Irish retailer Primark would be on the first level of its space while Dick's Sporting Goods would take parts of the second level.[18] The Primark store opened on November 25, 2015.[19] On March 17, 2017, JCPenney announced that its store would be closing as part of a plan to close 138 stores nationwide; the store closed on July 31, 2017.[20]\\r\\nThe sixth anchor store in the Plaza (the former Wanamaker's/Strawbridge's/Macy's building), was demolished during the fall of 2011. Over 100,000 sq ft. of retail space adjacent to the former department store has been since been redeveloped. A new loading dock was added during the redevelopment. [21] and some of the stores within the redevelopment have already opened, including a relocated, 2-level Forever 21 and an Athleta. H&M has relocated to a 2-level store as well, and they opened right next to the new Forever 21. A second H&M opened November 21, 2012.\\r\\nOn November 29, 2011, Simon Property Group announced plans to create a 140,000 sq ft. expansion to connect The Court and The Plaza.[22] This new retail connector would feature 50 stores, dining choices from some of Philadelphia's well-known celebrity chefs, an upscale dining pavilion, and a customer lounge. Upon completion, this project would make King of Prussia Mall the largest official shopping mall in the United States (larger than Mall of America in overall square footage), and it would be under one roof for the first time. The 155,000-square-foot expansion also included a new parking garage with speed ramps, space location technology and valet service.[23] Construction on this expansion was estimated to cost $150 million.[24] Several outparcels are also proposed for this expansion.[25] On November 18, 2014, construction began on the expansion to connect The Court and The Plaza.[26] The expansion opened August 18, 2016, with two ribbons joined from The Court and The Plaza.[27] Simon Property Group COO Rick Sokolov and U.S. Representative Brendan Boyle were present for the ribbon tying ceremony.[28]","field3":"How many stores does king of prussia have?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower and middle body into the right atrium of the heart.","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The inferior vena cava (or IVC) is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower and middle body into the right atrium of the heart. Its walls are rigid and has valves so the blood does not flow down via gravity. It is formed by the joining of the right and the left common iliac veins, usually at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inferior vena cava is the lower (\\"inferior\\") of the two venae cavae, the two large veins that carry deoxygenated blood from the body: the inferior vena cava carries blood from the lower half of the body whilst the superior vena cava carries blood from the upper half of the body. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a large retroperitoneal vein that lies posterior to the abdominal cavity and runs along the right side of the vertebral column. It enters the right atrium at the lower right, back side of the heart. The name derives from Latin: vena, \\"vein\\", cavus, \\"hollow\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inferior vena cava is formed by the joining of the left and right common iliac veins and brings collected blood into the right atrium of the heart. It also joins with the azygos vein (which runs on the right side of the vertebral column) and  venous plexuses next to the spinal cord.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inferior vena cava begins as the left and right common iliac veins behind the abdomen unite, at about the level of L5. It passes through the thoracic diaphragm at the caval opening at the level of T8.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe specific levels of the tributaries are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the inferior vena cava is located to the right of the midline, drainage of the tributaries is not always symmetrical. On the right, the gonadal veins and suprarenal veins drain into the inferior vena cava directly. On the left, they drain into the renal vein which in turn drains into the inferior vena cava. By contrast, all the lumbar veins and hepatic veins usually drain directly into the inferior vena cava.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the embryo, the inferior vena cava and right atrium are separated by the valve of the inferior vena cava, also known as the Eustachian valve. In the adult, this valve typically has totally regressed or remains as a small fold of endocardium.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nRarely, the inferior vena cava may vary in its size and position. In transposition of the great arteries the inferior vena cava may lie on the left. It may be replaced by two vessels beneath the level of the renal veins.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inferior vena cava is a vein. It carries deoxygenated blood from the lower half of the body to the right atrium of the heart.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe corresponding vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the upper half of the body is the superior vena cava.\\r\\n\\r\\nHealth problems attributed to the IVC are most often associated with it being compressed (ruptures are rare because it has a low intraluminal pressure). Typical sources of external pressure are an enlarged aorta (abdominal aortic aneurysm), the gravid uterus (aortocaval compression syndrome) and abdominal maligancies, such as colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer.  Since the inferior vena cava is primarily a right-sided structure, unconscious pregnant women should be turned on to their left side (the recovery position), to relieve pressure on it and facilitate venous return[citation needed].  In rare cases, straining associated with defecation can lead to restricted blood flow through the IVC and result in syncope (fainting).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlockage of the inferior vena cava is rare, and is treated urgently as a life-threatening condition. It is associated with deep vein thrombosis, IVC filters, liver transplantation and surgical procedures such as the insertion of a catheter in the femoral vein in the groin.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrauma to the vena cava is usually fatal as unstoppable excessive blood loss occurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nInferior vena cava\\r\\n\\r\\nInferior vena cava front view","field3":"What is the function of the vena cava?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak of Delhi","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra (literally \\"shed of 2? days\\") is a mosque in the Ajmer city of Rajasthan, India. It was commissioned by Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak, on orders of Muhammad Ghori, in 1192 CE. It was completed in 1199 CE, and further beautified by Iltutmish of Delhi in 1213 CE. The mosque was constructed on the remains of a Sanskrit college, with materials from destroyed Hindu and Jain temples. It is one of the oldest mosques in India, and the oldest surviving monument in Ajmer.\\r\\nAn early example of the Indo-Islamic architecture, most of the building was constructed by Hindu masons, under the supervision of Afghan managers. The site is now maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra\\" literally means \\"shed of two-and-a-half days\\". Alternative transliterations and names include Arhai Din ka Jhompra or Dhai Din ki Masjid. A legend states that a part of the mosque was built in two-and-a-half days (see #Conversion into a mosque below). Some Sufis claim that the name signifies a human's temporary life on the earth.[1]\\r\\nAccording to the ASI, the name probably comes from a two-and-a-half-day-long fair that used to be held at the site.[2] Har Bilas Sarda points out that the name \\"Adhai-Din-ka-Jhonpra\\" is not mentioned in any historical source. Before the 18th century, the mosque was simply known as a \\"Masjid\\" (\\"mosque\\"), since it had been the only mosque in Ajmer for centuries. It came to be known as a jhonpra (\\"shed\\" or \\"hut\\") when fakirs started gathering here to celebrate urs (death anniversary fair) of their leader Panjaba Shah. This happened during the Maratha era, in the second half of the 18th century. The urs lasted for two-and-a-half days, resulting in the modern name of the mosque.[3][4]\\r\\nAlexander Cunningham described the building as the \\"Great Mosque of Ajmer\\".\\r\\nThe site of the mosque was originally a Sanskrit college building commissioned by Vigraharaja IV (alias Visaladeva), a king of the Shakambhari Chahamana (Chauhan) dynasty. The original building was square-shaped, with a tower-chhatri (dome-shaped pavilion) at each corner.[5][6] A temple dedicated to Sarasvati was located on the western side. A tablet dated to 1153 CE was found at the site in the 19th century; based on this, it can be inferred that the original building must have been constructed sometime before 1153 CE.[3] According to the local Jain tradition, the building was originally constructed by Seth Viramdeva Kala in 660 CE as a Jain shrine to celebrate Panch Kalyanaka.[3]\\r\\nThe relics in the modern building show both Hindu and Jain features. According to KDL Khan, the building materials were taken from Hindu and Jain temples.[1] According to Caterina Mercone Maxwell and Marijke Rijsberman, the Sanskrit college was a Jain institution, and the building materials were taken from Hindu temples.[7] ASI Director-General Alexander Cunningham hypothesized that the pillars used in the building were probably taken from 20ÿ30 demolished Hindu temples, which featured at least 700 pillars in total. Based on the pillar inscriptions, he concluded that these original temples dated to 11th or 12th century CE.[8]\\r\\nThe original building was partially destroyed and converted into a mosque by Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak of Delhi in the late 12th century. According to a local legend, after defeating Vigraharaja's nephew Prithviraja III in the Second Battle of Tarain, Muhammad Ghori passed through Ajmer. There, he saw the magnificent temples, and ordered his slave general Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak to destroy them, and construct a mosque ÿ all within 60 hours (that is, ?2?1?2 days). The artisans could not build a complete mosque in 60 hours time, but constructed a brick screen wall where Ghori could offer prayers. By the end of the century, a complete mosque was built.[1]\\r\\nThe central mihrab in the mosque contains an inscription indicating the completion date of the mosque. It is dated Jumada II 595 AH (April 1199 CE). This makes the mosque one of the oldest in India, and the second mosque to be built by the Mamluks of Delhi (the first being the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque). Another inscription, dated Dhu al-Hijjah 596 AH (SeptemberÿOctober 1200 CE), names Abu Bakr ibn Ahmed Khalu Al-Hirawi as the supervisor of construction.[9] This makes Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra one of the oldest mosques in India,[10] and the oldest surviving monument in Ajmer.[11]\\r\\nIltutmish, the successor of Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak, subsequently beautified the mosque in 1213 CE, with a screen wall pierced by corbelled engrailed arches  a first in India.[2] An inscription on the central arch of the screen as well as two inscriptions of the northern minaret contain his name. The second arch from the south names one Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Arid as the construction supervisor.[9]\\r\\nThe mosque seems to have been ignored by the later kings. It does not find a mention in Taj-ul-Maasir, the earliest history of the Mamluk dynasty. It is not mentioned in Khalji, Lodi, Rathore, Sisodia and Mughal chronicles either. The Maratha leader Daulat Rao Sindhia (1779ÿ1827) restored the central dome of the building, and imposed a ban of removal of stones from the structure. An inscription dated Saavan 1866 VS (1809 CE) exhorts Hindus and Muslims not to remove stones from the ancient building.[3]\\r\\nIn 1818, Ajmer came under the Company rule. James Tod visited the mosque in 1819, and described it in his Annals and Antiquities of Rajast?han as \\"one of the most perfect as well as the most ancient monuments of Hindu architecture.\\" Subsequently, Alexander Cunningham, the Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) inspected the building in 1864, and described it in the ASI report of that year.[3] Tod believed the earlier structure to be a Jain temple. However, Cunningham pointed out that this could not be correct, since the pillars in the building feature several four-armed figures (characteristic of Hindu gods) besides a figure of the Hindu goddess Kali.[8]\\r\\nDuring an 1875ÿ76 archaeological survey, inscriptions referring to a Sanskrit college were unearthed in the mosque premises.[12] Several sculptures and 6 Devanagari basalt tablets (slabs) were recovered from the site. These artifacts are now exhibited at the Ajmer Museum.[1] The tablets are as follows:[3]\\r\\nThe tablets containing the plays were engraved by Bhaskar, son of Mahipati and grandson of Govinda, hailing from a family of Huna chiefs.[3]\\r\\nAnother Devanagari inscription is located on a marble pillar in the balcony of an entrance gate. It records the visit of Dharma, a mason of Bundi in the Jyeshtha 1462 VS (1405 CE), during the reign of Rana Mokal.[3]\\r\\nDuring the tenure of Viceroy Lord Mayo, between 1875 and 1878 CE, repairs to the structure were carried out at a cost of ? 23,128. Another restoration, costing ? 7,538 was carried out in 1900ÿ1903, under the supervision of Ajmer-Merwara commissioner ALP Tucker.[3] ASI archaeologists Alexander Cunningham and D. R. Bhandarkar carried out a restoration of the building in the first half of the 20th century.[1] Cunningham remarked that no other building of historical or archaeological importance in India was more worthy of preservation.[5]\\r\\nThe mosque is among the earliest examples of the Indo-Islamic architecture. It was designed by Abu Bakr of Herat, an architect who accompanied Muhammad Ghori. The mosque was built almost entirely by Hindu masons, under the supervision of Afghan managers.[1]\\r\\nThe mosque is much larger than the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque of Delhi. The exterior of the building is square-shaped, with each side measuring 259 feet.[8] There are two entrances, one at the south, and another at the east. The prayer area (the actual mosque) is located in the west, while the north side faces a hill rock. The actual mosque building on the western side has 10 domes and 124 pillars; there are 92 pillars on the eastern side; and 64 pillars on each of the remaining sides. Thus, there are 344 pillars in the entire building.[8] Out of these, only 70 pillars remain standing now.[3] It has a square dimension measuring 80?m (260?ft). The tall and slender pillars are not overcrowded and the ones in the courtyard are symmetrically placed. The sanctuary measures 43?m (141?ft) by 12?m (39?ft). The mihrab is built with white marbles. It is believed that Iltumish added the seven arch screen by 1230, is considered to be an architecturally most notable feature of the mosque. The large central arch is accompanied by two small fluted minarets.[13]\\r\\nArcade pillars\\r\\nArcade ceiling\\r\\nMihrab arcade\\r\\nEntrance staircase\\r\\nThe front facade of the structure features a huge screen with yellow limestone arches, built during the reign of Iltutmish. The main arch is nearly 60 feet high, and is flanked by six smaller arches. The arches have small rectangular panels for passage of daylight, similar to the ones found in early Arabian mosques. The archway features Kufic and Tughra inscriptions and quotations from Koran, and is reminiscent of Islamic architecture from Ghazni and Turkistan. Some of the carvings feature Arabesque floral and foliate patterns; their geometric symmetry is reminiscent of Persian tilework. Their filigree sets them apart from Hindu-style carvings in the same building. The Hindu patterns are similar to the ones seen in the 10th century structures at Nagda and the 11th century Sas-Bahu Temple at Gwalior.[1][9] The 19th century American traveler John Fletcher Hurst described the screen as \\"a gem of great renown throughout the Mohammedan world.\\"[14]\\r\\nOrnate carvings and Kufic inscriptions\\r\\nFloral motif\\r\\nArches with inscriptions from Koran\\r\\nDecorative screen wall\\r\\nInscriptions on the screen wall\\r\\nThe interior of the building is a quadrangle measuring 200 G 175 feet. It comprises a main hall (248 G 40 feet) supported by cloisters of pillars.[8] The pillars feature varying designs, and heavily decorated, similar to the ones in Hindu and Jain rock temples. They have large bases, and taper as they rise in height. According to K.D.L. Khan, the pillars and roofs are from the pre-Islamic structure, but the original carvings were destroyed by Muslims.[1] Michael W. Meister believes that some of the pillars were newly created by Hindu masons for their Muslim masters; these were combined with the older, plundered pillars (whose images were defaced). Similarly, he states that the ceilings combine newer and older work by Hindu workers.[9]\\r\\nThe muazzin's towers are located in two small minarets (10.5 in diameter). These minarets are located at the top of an 11.5 feet thick screen wall. The minarets are now ruined, but their remnants show that they were sloping hollow towers with 24 alternately angular and circular flutes, just like the ones in the Qutb Minar of Delhi.[8]\\r\\nAlexander Cunningham praised the architecture of Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra and Quwwat-ul-Islam mosques in the following words:[8]\\r\\nScottish architectural historian James Fergusson similarly remarked:[5][15]\\r\\nGate\\r\\nWindow\\r\\nNiche\\r\\nDome interior\\r\\nMinaret\\r\\nBracket\\r\\n Media related to Adhai Din-ka-Jhonpra at Wikimedia Commons","field3":"Who built adhai din ka jhopra at ajmer?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"May 25, 2010","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"","field3":"When did drake put out his first album?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"0.08%","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Drunk driving is the act of operating a motor vehicle while the operator's ability to do so impaired as a result of alcohol consumption, or with a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit.[1] For drivers 21 years or older, driving with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08% or higher is illegal. For drivers under 21 years old, the legal limit is lower, with state limits ranging from 0.00 to 0.02.[2] Different BAC limits apply when operating boats, airplanes, or commercial vehicles. Among other names, the criminal offense of drunk driving may be called driving under the influence (DUI), driving while impaired (DWI) or operating while impaired (OWI).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, approximately 1.5 million drunk driving arrests were made nationwide in 1996. In 2012, 29.1 million people admitted to driving under the influence of alcohol.[4] In 1997 an estimated 513,200 DUI offenders were under correctional supervision, down from 593,000 in 1990 and up from 270,100 in 1986.[5]\\r\\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that in 1996 local law enforcement agencies made 1,467,300 arrests nationwide for driving under the influence of alcohol, 1 out of every 10 arrests for all crimes in the U.S., compared to 1.9 million such arrests during the peak year in 1983, accounting for 1 out of every 80 licensed drivers in the U.S.[6][7] This represented a 220% increase in DUI arrests from 1970 to 1986, while the number of licensed drivers increased by just 42% in the same period.[8]\\r\\nThe arrest rate for alcohol-related offenses among American Indians was more than double that for the total population during 1996, and almost 4 in 10 American Indians held in local jails had been charged with a public order offense, most commonly driving while intoxicated.[9] In 2012, 29.1 million people admitted to driving under the influence of alcohol.[10][11]\\r\\nRecent analysis have shown cities in which ride sharing services operate show mixed results as to whether the availability of those services affects rates of impaired driving.[12]\\r\\nThe risk of having a traffic accident increases with a higher BAC.[13][14]\\r\\nThe NHTSA estimates that about 18,000 people died in 2006 from \\"alcohol-related\\" collisions, representing 40% of total traffic deaths in the US. Over the decade 2001-2010, this rate showed only a 3% variation, and no trend.[15]\\r\\nDrivers with a BAC of 0.10% are 6 to 12 times more likely to get into a fatal crash or injury than drivers without positive blood alcohol.[13][14][16] The NHTSA states 275,000 were injured in alcohol-related accidents in 2003.[17] Approximately 60% of the BAC values for motor vehicle accidents are missing or unknown. To analyze what they believe is the complete data, statisticians estimate BAC information.[18]\\r\\nThe NHTSA defines fatal collisions as \\"alcohol-related\\" if they believe the driver, a passenger, or non-motorist (such as a pedestrian or pedal cyclist) had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.01% or greater. The NHTSA defines nonfatal collisions as alcohol-related if the accident report indicates evidence of alcohol present, even if no driver or occupant was tested for alcohol.[11] The NHTSA specifically notes that alcohol-related does not necessarily mean a driver or non-occupant was tested for alcohol and that the term does not indicate a collision or fatality was caused by the presence of alcohol.[11] If anyone involved in the accident (even a passenger) has a BAC of 0.01% of greater, then the NTHSA classifies the accident as alcohol-related.[11] Alcohol-related injuries were estimated at 275,000 in 2003.[17]\\r\\nFor the most part, DUI or DWI are synonymous terms that represent the criminal offense of operating (or in some jurisdictions merely being in physical control of) a motor vehicle while being under the influence of alcohol or drugs or a combination of both. The key inquiry focuses on whether the driver's faculties were impaired by the substance that was consumed. The detection and successful prosecution of drivers impaired by prescription medication or illegal drugs can therefore be difficult. Breathalyzers have been developed for the purpose of administering roadside or laboratory tests that can detect the actual level of a controlled substance in an individual's body.\\r\\nNew Jersey enacted the first law that specifically criminalized driving an automobile while intoxicated, in 1906. The New Jersey statute provided that \\"[n]o intoxicated person shall drive a motor vehicle.\\" Violation of this provision was punishable by a fine of up to $500, or a term of up to 60 days in county jail.[19]\\r\\nEarly laws, such as that enacted in New Jersey, required proof of a state of intoxication with no specific definition of what level of inebriation qualified.[20] The first generally accepted legal BAC limit was 0.15%. New York, for example, which had enacted a prohibition on driving while intoxicated in 1910,[21] amended this law in 1941 to provide that it would constitute prima facie evidence of intoxication when an arrested person was found to have a BAC of .15 percent or higher, as ascertained through a test administered within two hours of arrest.[22]\\r\\nIn 1938, the American Medical Association created a \\"Committee to Study Problems of Motor Vehicle Accidents\\". At the same time, the National Safety Council set up a \\"Committee on Tests for Intoxication\\".\\r\\nIn the US, most of the laws and penalties were greatly enhanced starting in the late 1970s, and through the 1990s, largely due to pressure from groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD) and leaders like Candy Lightner. Significantly, zero tolerance laws were enacted which criminalized driving a vehicle with 0.01% or 0.02% BAC for drivers under 21. This is true even in Puerto Rico, despite maintaining a legal drinking age of 18.[23]\\r\\nOn May 14, 2013, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that all 50 states lower the benchmark for determining when a driver is legally drunk from 0.08 blood-alcohol content to 0.05. The idea is part of an initiative to eliminate drunk driving, which accounts for about a third of all road deaths.[24] In light of this push by the NTSB, and in addition to numerous media reports, many bloggers/authors have posted content addressing the Debate Surrounding Lowering the Legal Limit from 0.08% to 0.05%.\\r\\nAfter the passage of federal legislation, the legal limit for commercial drivers is now set at 0.04%. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulation prohibits those who hold a commercial driver's license from driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. A commercial driver with an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, must be removed from duty for 24 hours.[25]\\r\\nIn construing the terms DUI, DWI, OWI and OVI, some states make it illegal to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence or driving while intoxicated while others indicate that it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle. There is a split of authority across the country regarding this issue. Some states permit enforcement of DUI, DWI and OWI/OVI statutes based on \\"operation and control\\" of a vehicle, while others require actual \\"driving\\". \\"The distinction between these terms is material, for it is generally held that the word 'drive,' as used in statutes of this kind, usually denotes movement of the vehicle in some direction, whereas the word 'operate' has a broader meaning so as to include not only the motion of the vehicle, but also acts which engage the machinery of the vehicle that, alone or in sequence, will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle.\\" (State v. Graves (1977) 269 S.C. 356 [237 S.E.2d 584, 586-588, 586. fn. 8]\\r\\nEvery state in the U.S. designates a \\"per se\\" blood or breath alcohol level as the threshold point for an independent criminal offense. This is often referred to as the \\"legal limit\\". It is a permissive presumption of guilt where the person's BAC is 0.08% or greater (units of milligrams per deciliter, representing 8 g of alcohol in 10 liters of blood).[26] Some states (e.g., Colorado) include a lesser charge, sometimes referred to as \\"driving while ability impaired\\" that may apply to individuals with a 0.05% or above, but less than the 0.08% per se limit for the more serious charge.[26]\\r\\nEvery state has a \\"catch-all\\" provision designed to cover those circumstances where the person is below 0.08%, but the person still appears impaired by definition of law. These types of \\"catch-all\\" statutes cover situations involving a person under the influence of drugs or under the combined influence of alcohol and drugs. With the advent of the legalization of marijuana, these catch-all provisions cover those prosecutions pursuing those charged with driving under the influence of drugs or even drugs and alcohol.\\r\\nAll U.S. states have implied consent laws which state that a licensed driver has given their consent to a field sobriety test and/or a Breathalyzer or similar manner of determining blood alcohol concentration. In 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States in Birchfield v. North Dakota held that both breath tests and blood tests constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment, concluding that requiring breath tests is constitutional without a search warrant, however, requiring more intrusive blood tests involving piercing the skin is not, as the goal of traffic safety can be obtained by less invasive means.[27]\\r\\nEvery state has enhanced penalties for refusing to submit to an Implied Consent Test pursuant to the State's Implied Consent Laws. In California, refusing to submit to a test of one's breath or blood upon being arrested for driving under the influence carries an additional punishment of a one-year license suspension pursuant to California Vehicle Code Section 13558(c)(1).\\r\\nArizona has a 0.08% BAC limit for standard DUI, but drivers can also face more severe DUI charges like an Extreme DUI ( 28-1382(A)(1)) for having a BAC over 0.15% or Super Extreme DUI ( 28-1382(A)(2)) for a BAC over 0.20%.[28]\\r\\nLike every other state, California has a \\"per se\\" BAC limit of 0.08% pursuant to California Vehicle Code Section 23152(b); and based on the aforementioned federal legislation, a lower limit of 0.04% for drivers holding commercial drivers licenses (CDL). California also has a limit of 0.01% for drivers who are under 21 or on probation for previous DUI offenses pursuant to California Vehicle Code Sections 23136 and 23140. California also makes it illegal for persons who are on probation for a DUI conviction to drive with a blood or breath alcohol concentration of 0.01% or greater pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 23154. While the existence of a BAC of 0.01% or greater may not always result in prosecution for driving under the influence, it will expose such drivers to a one or two-year suspension through an administrative action by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. If that same person has a BAC of 0.08% or greater, it will prompt what is referred to as a \\"dual action\\", meaning a suspension for driving with a BAC of 0.08% or greater and a suspension for driving with a BAC of 0.01% or greater while on DUI Probation.\\r\\nIn California, in Mercer v. DMV (1991) 53 Cal.3d 753,[29] the California State Supreme Court contrasted the term drive, commonly understood to require volitional movement of the vehicle, with the term driver, defined in California Vehicle Code  305 as one who is either driving or in actual physical control. The court pointed out that the phrase actual physical control does not appear anywhere in the drunk driving offense statutes. Further, the court noted that since driver is defined as one who drives or is in actual physical control, the two terms (drive vs. actual physical control) must have different meanings. Construing these penal statutes strictly, rather than broadly, as is required by Keeler v. Superior Court of Amador County (1970) 2 Cal.3d 619, 631, the court held that mere actual physical control is not enough to constitute driving. Therefore, the term: drive, at least for purposes of the drunk driving statutes, requires volitional movement of the vehicle. In coming to this conclusion, the California Supreme Court held that in everyday usage the phrase, \\"to drive a vehicle,\\" is understood as requiring evidence of volitional movement of a vehicle. Numerous dictionary definitions-including Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1981), cited by the Court of Appeal in the case that led to the California Supreme Court's review of this case, support a definition of \\"drive\\" that includes movement. (See, e.g., Id., at p.?692.) fn. 5. The Mercer Court held that it believed that these definitions are consistent with the usual and ordinary understanding of that term, and suggest the sense in which the word was intended by the Legislature in the present context.\\r\\nCalifornia's \\"catch-all\\" provision was previously found in California Vehicle Code Section 23152(a); however new statutes that were made effective on January 1, 2014, two new sections were created to make sections specifically addressing those charged with driving under the influence of drugs, (which includes prescription medications if it can be shown that those medications impaired the driver), and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs.\\r\\nNevada has an implied consent law, an agreement every motor vehicle license recipient must accept, that makes breath or blood testing mandatory if an officer has reasonable suspicion of impairment. Refusal is grounds for arrest and law enforcement may use reasonable force to obtain blood samples[30]\\r\\nWisconsin regards first offense drunk driving as a municipal offense, and New Jersey treats all drunk driving cases without serious injury or death as traffic violations.[31] The amount of alcohol intake to reach a BAC of 0.08% may vary with the individual's body composition and state of health. Prior to increased emphasis on drinking and driving in the 1980s, standards of 0.10%-0.15% were in place.\\r\\nNew Jersey has a general 0.08% BAC limit, but people can be convicted of drunk driving even when the BAC is under that limit.[32]\\r\\nNorth Carolina has a general 0.08% BAC limit,[33] a lower limit of 0.04% for drivers holding commercial drivers licenses (CDL) while operating a commercial vehicle.[34] Additionally, it is illegal for anyone under the age of twenty-one (21) to possess or consume alcohol.[35]\\r\\nSix states require physicians to report patients who drive while impaired.[36] Another 25 states permit physicians to violate doctor-patient confidentiality to report impaired drivers, if they so choose.[36] The American Medical Association endorsed physician reporting in 1999, but deferred to the states on whether such notification should be mandatory or permissive.[36] Medical bioethicist Jacob Appel of New York University says physician reporting may deter some patients from seeking care, writing \\"Reporting may remove some dangerous drivers from the roads, but if in doing so it actually creates other dangerous drivers, by scaring them away from treatment, then society has sacrificed confidentiality for no tangible return in lives saved.\\"[36]\\r\\nThe consequences of an impaired driving charge include both criminal and administrative penalties. Criminal penalties are imposed as a result of criminal prosecution. Administrative penalties are imposed by a state agency, and in some cases may apply even if a person stopped for impaired driving is not convicted of the offense.\\r\\nThe penalties for drunk driving from state-to-state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is not uncommon for the penalties to be different from county-to-county within any given state depending on the practices of the individual jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions require jail time and larger fines, even on a first offense. For instance, Ohio requires a mandatory 72-hour jail sentence for a first offense conviction; however, the jail time component is satisfied by attendance of the Ohio A.W.A.R.E. Program, which is a 72-hour alcohol-education program. Compared to many other countries, such as Sweden, penalties for drunk driving in the United States are considered less severe unless alcohol is involved in an incident causing injury or death of another, such DUI, DWI or OWI with Great Bodily Injury (GBI) or Vehicular Manslaughter.\\r\\nThe State of Washington used to permit those charged with a first offense drunk driving to complete a diversion program that resulted in the charges being dismissed upon the completion of a Diversion Program. In 1975, under the revised code of Washington or RCW Section 10.05, the Washington State Legislature established a deferred prosecution option for offenders arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or impairing drugs (DUI). It was intended to encourage individuals to seek appropriate treatment and, under this option, defendants with a significant alcohol or drug dependence problem could petition a court to defer disposition of their charge until they have completed intensive substance dependence treatment and met other conditions required by the court. If the defendant successfully completed the terms of the program, the charge was dismissed; for those who failed, the deferred status was revoked and the defendant was prosecuted for the original DUI charge. (RCW 10.05.010 and 10.05.020) In 1992, the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute evaluated DUI deferred prosecution and concluded the program reduced DUI recidivism.[37] In 1998, the legislature modified the DUI statutes. Among other things, the length of deferred prosecution supervision was increased from two to five years and defendants were restricted to one deferred prosecution per lifetime.\\r\\nThese innovative courts use substance abuse intervention with repeat offenders who plead guilty to driving while intoxicated. Those accepted into the diversionary program are required to abstain from alcohol. Some are required to wear a device that monitors and records any levels of alcohol detected in their bloodstreams.\\r\\nThe federal Assimilative Crimes Act, which makes state law applicable on lands reserved or acquired by the Federal government when the act or omission is not made punishable by an enactment of Congress, recognizes collateral actions related to DUI convictions as punishments. According to 18 U.S.C.??13:\\r\\n that which may or shall be imposed through judicial or administrative action under the law of a State, territory, possession, or district, for a conviction for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of a drug or alcohol, shall be considered to be a punishment provided by that law \\r\\nAn SR-22 is an addendum to an insurance policy. It is an administrative form that attests to an insurance company's coverage, or the posting of a personal public bond in the amount of the state's minimum liability coverage for the licensed driver or vehicle registration. The SR in SR-22 stands for Safety Responsibility, and it is needed to reinstate a suspended driver's license after a DUI conviction in 49 states and the District of Columbia. It is submitted to the State's DMV by an auto insurance company to serve as proof that a driver has the minimum liability insurance that the states requires. They are essentially an agreement between a driver's insurance company and the respective State's DMV that requires the driver's insurance company to notify the respective State's DMV that the driver's insurance has either been terminated or lapsed; thus instituting a suspension of the driver's driving privileges until proof of insurance is re-filed with the State's DMV.\\r\\nWhile SR-22s are typically filed with the respective State's DMV, some States require the driver to carry proof of the SR-22 or to carry it in the registered vehicle, (particularly if the driver has been cited for coverage lapses or other administrative infractions). SR-22s may attest coverage for a vehicle regardless of operator (owner liability coverage), or cover a specific person regardless of the specific vehicle operated (operator liability coverage).\\r\\nAs stated, the form is required in 49 states and the US District of Columbia in order to register a vehicle for usage on public roads. It is also required to redeem a license which has been suspended due to coverage lapse in these required states. These states also, generally, require that the issuing insurance company provide the relevant state's DMV with timely updates as to the status of such coverage. If the policy with the SR22 cancels, a form called an SR26 is issued and sent to the state DMV.[38] Upon notice that there has been a lapse in coverage, the state will suspend the driver's license again.[39] Another SR-22 filing will need to be submitted to regain driving privileges.\\r\\nEvery jurisdiction imposes the completion of alcohol education programs, commonly known as DUI programs, subsequent to a DUI/DWI/OWI conviction. Additionally, some states impose an additional requirement that a person attend a Victim Impact Panel (VIP) administered by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), which was established in 1982. Both DUI classes and Victim Impact Panels are available in some states for first offense DUIs dependent on the judge's decision.[40]\\r\\nIn 1967, Ohio began to issue special license plates to DUI offenders who are granted limited driving privileges such as work-related driving until a court can rule that they can have full privileges back. In 2004, the plates became mandated by state law to all DUI offenders.[41] Unlike Ohio's standard-issue plates (which as of 2008 have a picture of the Ohio country side), the DUI plates are yellow with red writing with no registration stickers or graphics. They are commonly referred to as \\"party plates\\".[41]\\r\\nMinnesota has a similar program, where the plates are white with either blue or black text. The plate number is a \\"W\\", followed by a letter and four numbers. These plates may be issued to drivers with at least 2 offenses in a five-year period; three offenses in a ten-year period; having a BAC twice the legal limit; or having a child in the car at the time of arrest.[42] In Minnesota, DUI plates are referred to as \\"whiskey plates\\",[43] whiskey being the name of the letter W in the NATO phonetic alphabet.\\r\\nSome states, such as California, may impose the installation of ignition interlock devices in cases where the driver's BAC is over 0.20%, or 0.15% in some places. These additional sanctions are meant to deter and punish the operation of a vehicle at extremely high BAC levels and the concomitant danger posed to the safety of persons and property by heavily impaired drivers.\\r\\nAs of July 1, 2010, California implemented a pilot project for DUI sentencing. In four counties, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Tulare and Alameda, first offenders convicted of drunk driving are required to install an ignition interlock device in their car for a period of five months and second offenders for a period of one year.[44] Previously, this requirement was only required for third offenders and permitted for second offenders, and then for a three-year period. The California DMV has written guidelines to clear up some ambiguities in the law. Costs associated with ignition interlock devices include $70 ÿ $150 for installation and fees in the range of $60 - $80 per month thereafter.[45]\\r\\nSome states, such as California, allow for the impoundment and forfeiture of vehicles under certain conditions.[46][47]\\r\\nFollowing are common procedures when a law enforcement officer has reason to suspect a driver is intoxicated.\\r\\nThere are several situations in which the officer will come into contact with a driver, some examples are:\\r\\nThe following list of DUI symptoms, from a publication issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (DOT HS-805-711),[48] is widely used in training officers to detect drunk drivers. After each symptom is a percentage figure which, according to NHTSA, indicates the statistical chances through research, that a driver is over the legal limit.\\r\\nIf the officer observes enough evidence to have a \\"Reasonable Suspicion\\" to legally justify a further detention and investigation, they will ask the driver to step out of the vehicle.\\r\\nReasonable suspicion requires less evidence than \\"Probable Cause\\", but more than a mere hunch. A rule of thumb is that reasonable suspicion requires 25% proof, and probable cause requires more than 50% statistical chance. Therefore, if there is probable cause for arrest for DUI/DWIOWI, as suggested by the research and examples used above, then there is reasonable suspicion to stop a driver.\\r\\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, police officers should conduct DUI Investigations according to a specific protocol called phases. According to the NHTSA training, DUI Investigations are categorized by these phases:\\r\\nThe Vehicle in Motion Phase deals with the law enforcement officers observations of the suspect's driving maneuvers. The Personal Contact Phase is where the officer actually comes into contact with the DUI suspect. The Pre-Arrest Screening Phase is portion of the DUI Investigation that encompasses the Pre-Field Sobriety Test Questioning and the Field Sobriety Testing, including a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test where applicable. This Phase also includes the post-arrest evidentiary chemical test despite that it occurs subsequent to a DUI arrest, not prior to a DUI arrest.\\r\\nThe officer will typically approach the driver's window and ask some preliminary questions. During this phase of the stop the officer will note if they detect any of the following indicators of intoxication\\r\\nIf the officer observes enough to have a reasonable suspicion to legally justify a further detention and investigation, they will ask the driver to step out of the vehicle.\\r\\nOne of the most controversial aspects of a DUI stop is the field sobriety test (FSTs). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has developed a model system for managing Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) training. They have published numerous training manuals associated with FSTs. As a result of the NHTSA studies, the walk-and-turn test was determined to be 68% accurate, and the one-leg stand test is only 65% accurate when administered to people within the study parameters. The tests were not validated for people with medical conditions, injuries, 65 years or older, and 50 pounds or greater overweight. The officer will administer one or more field sobriety tests. FSTs are considered \\"divided attention tests\\" that test the suspect's ability to perform the type of mental and physical multitasking that is required to operate an automobile. However, these tests can be problematic for people with non-obvious disabilities affecting proprioception, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\\r\\nThe three validated tests by NHTSA are:\\r\\nAlternative tests, which have not been scientifically validated, include:\\r\\nAlthough most law enforcement agencies continue to use a variety of these FSTs, most use the 3-test battery of validated field sobriety tests, referred to as the Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFSTs). The NHTSA-approved battery of tests consists of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test, or HGN Test; the Walk-and-Turn Test, or the WAT Test, and the One-Leg-Stand Test, or the OLS Test.\\r\\nIn some states, such as Ohio, only the standardized tests will be admitted into evidence, provided they were administered and objectively scored \\"in substantial compliance\\" with NHTSA standards (ORC 4511.19(D)(4)(b)).[50]\\r\\nAccording to NHTSA, these tests were not designed to measure impairment, but rather to give a probability that a driver is at or above a 0.08% BAC. However, studies have shown that there are reasons to doubt the tests' usefulness in helping an officer to make such a determination. In 1991, Dr. Spurgeon Cole of Clemson University conducted a study of the accuracy of FSTs. His staff videotaped people performing six common field sobriety tests, then showed the tapes to 14 police officers and asked them to decide whether the suspects had \\"had too much to drink and drive\\" (sic). The blood-alcohol concentration of each of the 21 DUI subjects was 0.00, unknown to the officers. The result: the officers gave their opinion that 46% of these innocent people were too drunk to be able to drive. This study showed the possible inaccuracy of FSTs.[51]\\r\\nAn increasingly used field sobriety test involves having the suspect breathe into a small, handheld breath testing device. These are often referred to as PAS Tests, or \\"Preliminary Alcohol Screening\\" Tests\\", or a PBT, \\"Preliminary Breath Test\\" and precede the actual arrest and subsequent requirement to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of the suspect's breath or blood. These breath testing devices used are smaller, inexpensive versions of the larger, more sophisticated instruments at the police stations, commonly known as an Evidentiary Breath Test using an EBT device, or Evidentiary Breath Test device. However, an increasing number jurisdictions began using Portable Evidentiary Breath Test devices, or PEBT devices, that are more sophisticated versions of the smaller, inexpensive versions of the larger, larger instruments at the police stations. However, where the larger EBTs usually employ infrared spectroscopy, the PEBT and PAS devices use a relatively simple electrochemical (fuel cell) technology. When used for purposes of a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test, or PAS Test, their purpose, along with the other FSTs, is to assist the officer in determining whether he/she has probable cause for arrest.\\r\\nThere were three tests chosen to constitute the \\"Standardized Field Sobriety Tests\\", which are: (1) the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test; (2) the Walk & Turn Test; and (3) the One Leg Stand Test.\\r\\nThe Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test, or HGN Test, is administered by the police officer checking the test subject's eyes.\\r\\nHorizontal Gaze Nystagmus Instructions (HGN)\\r\\nHorizontal Gaze Nystagmus Evaluation\\r\\nThere are six cues or clues that a police officer is looking for on the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test, they are as follows:\\r\\nTotal Cues: 6 Cues - Decision Point: 4/6 Cues\\r\\nWhile the original research indicated that 6 out of 6 cues meant that a person was more likely above 0.08% at the time of the test, subsequent research conducted by the NHTSA has indicated that a Hit occurred when the number of reported signs for a given BAC fell within the range: > a 0.06% at 4ÿ6 cues or clues; a .05ÿ.059% at 2ÿ4 cues or clues; a 0.03ÿ0.049% at 0ÿ4 cues or clues and a < 0.03% at 0ÿ2 cues or clues. \\"The Robustness of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Study\\" (September, 2007)\\r\\nThe walk-and-turn test is composed of two phases: the Instruction Phase and Walking Phase. During the test, the individual is directed to take nine steps along a straight line. The individual is supposed to walk heel to toe, and while looking down at a real or imaginary line, count the steps out loud. The test subject's arms must remain at their side. Reaching the ending point, the individual must turn around using a series of small steps, and return to the starting point. The proper instruction, according to the NHTSA Guidelines, is as follows:\\r\\nThere are eight cues or clues that a police officer is looking for on the Walk & Turn Test, they are as follows:\\r\\nTotal Cues: 8 Cues ÿ Decision Point: 2/8 Cues\\r\\nThe One Leg Stand Test is composed of two stages: the Instruction Phase and Balancing Phase. The proper instruction, according to the NHTSA Guidelines, is as follows:\\r\\nThere are four cues or clues that a police officer is looking for on the One Leg Stand Test, they are as follows\\r\\nTotal Cues: 4 Cues ÿ Decision Point: 2/4 Cues\\r\\nCritics of standardized field sobriety tests often question the statistical evidence behind them, and the ability of the officers to administer the tests and actually judge for impairments related to alcohol. According to Barone, one study involved completely sober individuals who were asked to perform the standardized field sobriety tests, and their performances were videotaped. \\"After viewing the 21 videos of sober individuals taking the standardized field tests, the police officers believed that forty-six percent of the individuals had 'too much to drink'\\". It should not be out of the question for the standardized field sobriety tests to be re-examined for reliability and validity. A standardized test that claims to have scientific support should be able to be repeated. Along with that, the standardized field sobriety tests do not have a specific standard for grading, and it is left up to the discretion of the officer to determine whether what he/she see observes is actually a cue sufficient to count against the test subject. To err is human. The NHTSA's 1977 study had an error rate of 47 percent, and the 1981 study had an error rate of 32 percent, which is considered unusually high for a scientific study.[52]\\r\\nOne of the main criticisms of field sobriety tests is that the judgment is left up to the discretion of the police officer. An officer may have some bias towards a suspect and judge the test more critically than necessary. Additionally, it is almost impossible to tell whether or not a police officer used proper procedures for administering the field sobriety test when a case is brought to court. The original research conducted by the NHTSA is often disputed because of the manner in which they were conducted and the conclusions that were reported. One author comments that \\"The reports for all three studies issued by NHTSA are lacking much of the material and analysis expected in a scientific paper, and none have been published in peer-reviewed journals\\" (Rubenzer 2011).\\r\\nOne of the main problems with the walk-and-turn test is that some of the signs of alcohol impairment may stem from other physical problems. Along with that, there are other signs of physical impairment that can stem from various causes, including fatigue, an injury or illness, and nervousness. Those who are physically inactive, elderly, or obese may have trouble completing the walk-and-turn test without flaw. The NTSA used to say that those who are 50 pounds or more overweight may have difficulty performing the test, and that the suspect must walk along a real line. \\"Later NHTSA manuals removed the weight comment, and also inserted the phrase 'imaginary line' at the instruction phase, even though original research always used a visible line\\".[52] The fact that officers are no longer required to provide a line for the suspect to walk along may affect the outcome of the test, and often adds to the scrutiny received from critics.\\r\\nIf the officer has sufficient probable cause that the suspect has been driving under the influence of alcohol, they will make the arrest, handcuff the suspect and transport them to the police station. En route, the officer may advise them of their legal implied consent obligation to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of blood, breath or possibly urine depending on the jurisdiction.\\r\\nLaws relating to what exactly constitutes probable cause vary from state to state. In California it is a refutable presumption that a person with a BAC of 0.08% or higher is driving under the influence. However, section 23610(a)(2) of the California Vehicle Code states that driving with a BAC between 0.05% and 0.08% \\"shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of an alcoholic beverage\\".\\r\\nAn arrestee will be offered a chemical test of breath, blood or, much less frequently, urine. Breath test results are usually available immediately; urine and blood samples are sent to a lab for later analysis to determine the BAC or possible presence of drugs. Some states sought to impose criminal punishment for a refusal to submit to a chemical test of his/her breath or blood; however, in Birchfield v. North Dakota, the United States Supreme Court visited the issue of whether states can criminalize a refusal to submit to a chemical test. The United States Supreme Court decided that states may criminalize a refusal to submit to a breath test; but not a refusal to submit to a blood test absent a McNeely warrant, named after Missouri v. McNeely (2013), which was a case decided by United States Supreme Court, on appeal from the Supreme Court of Missouri, regarding exceptions to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution under exigent circumstances.[1] The United States Supreme Court ruled that police must generally obtain a warrant before subjecting a drunken-driving suspect to a blood test, and that the natural metabolism of blood alcohol does not establish a per se exigency that would justify a blood draw without consent.\\r\\nRegarding blood tests, some commentators, such as Brown University's Jacob Appel, have criticized the role of medical personnel in this process. According to Appel, \\"If physicians acquiesce today in the removal of a resistant patient's blood, soon they may be called upon to pump the contents of an unwilling patient's stomach or even to perform involuntary surgery to retrieve an evidential bullet\\".[53]\\r\\nWhile chemical tests are used to determine the driver's BAC, they do not determine the driver's level of impairment. However, state laws usually provide for a rebuttable legal presumption of intoxication at a BAC of 0.08% or higher (see blood alcohol test assumptions).\\r\\nIf it is determined after arrest that the person's BAC is not at or above the legal limit of 0.08%, they will probably be released without any charges. One may, however, still be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol on the basis of driving symptoms, observed impairment, admissions or performance on the field sobriety tests. And if there is suspicion of drug usage, a blood or urine test is likely, or at least the testimony of a specially trained officer called a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE). Assuming sufficient evidence of impaired driving from drugs, the arrested may face charges of driving under the influence of drugs or the combined influence of alcohol and drugs.\\r\\nMost of the time, the driver will either be kept in a holding cell (sometimes referred to as the \\"drunk tank\\") until they are deemed sober enough to be released on bail or on his \\"own recognizance\\" (\\"O.R.\\"). A date to appear in court for an arraignment will be given to them. If they cannot make bail or is not granted O.R., they will be kept in jail to wait for the arraignment on remand.\\r\\nIn the United States, paying the DUI ticket, court costs, and attorney fees is just the start of a person's financial obligations after a DUI conviction. Additional costs of a DUI conviction will often involve the installation and maintenance fees of a vehicle Ignition Interlock Device, which serves the same function as a Breathalyzer to enable the vehicle to start. A person convicted of a driving under the influence charge, can also expect to pay higher insurance rates and premiums.[54][55][56] In addition, DUI records prevent entry into Canada without proper documentation.[57]\\r\\nDrunk driving is a public health concern in the United States, and reducing its frequency may require an integrated community-based approach utilizing sanctions and treatments.[58] Several intervention programs have been developed, such as the Paradigm Developmental Model of Treatment (PDMT), a program encouraging a paradigm shift in the offender's view of oneself and the world.[59]\\r\\nThe National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism suggests environmental interventions to help eliminate drinking and driving all together.[citation needed]\\r\\nFederal Aviation Regulation 91.17 (14 C.F.R. 91.17) prohibits pilots from flying aircraft with an alcohol level of 0.04% or more, or within eight hours of consuming alcohol, or while under the impairing influence of any drug. The same prohibition applies to any other crew members on duty aboard the aircraft (flight attendants, etc.). Some airlines impose additional restrictions, and many pilots also impose stricter standards upon themselves. Commercial pilots found to be in violation of regulations are typically fired or resign voluntarily, and they may lose their pilot certificates and be subject to criminal prosecution under Federal or State laws, effectively ending their careers.\\r\\nSimilar laws apply to other activities involving transportation; Michigan prohibits intoxicated bicycling, horseback riding, buggy driving, use of motorized farm implements, or boating, the latter whether a pilot or passenger, with much the same threshold of intoxication. In the case of boating, the laws extend to include kayaks, canoes, sailboatsany flotation device that needs to be steered in water. Different states have different laws and classifications on the level of transgression attached to a citation for boating under the influence. For example, Virginia has very similar penalties for a BUI as it does for a DUI. Those convicted of boating while intoxicated face penalties including, fines of up to $2,500, jail time of up to one year, loss of your operators license for up to three years and mandatory enrollment and completion of a Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program.[60]\\r\\nAlcohol use was the number one contributing factor in U.S. recreational boating deaths between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 15 percent of the fatalities in 2003, and 17 percent in 2012.[61] A Canadian study published in 2011 examined 18 years of data on recreational boating, and concluded that a \\"true figure\\" of alcohol-related deaths in that country \\"may lie between 46% and 56%\\".[62]:15\\r\\nIn countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia drunk driving and deaths caused by drunk driving are considerably lower than in the USA. Drunk driving deaths in the UK (population 61 million, 31 million cars) were 380 in 2010 (21% of all fatal accidents).[63][64][65] In California (population 36 million, 32 million cars) there were 950 deaths from traffic accidents involving drivers with a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of 0.08 or greater) in 2009 (31% of all fatal accidents).[66][67] Alcohol consumption per capita in the UK and Australia is higher than in the USA and the legal age for drinking lower.[68]\\r\\nResearch in the United Kingdom has shown that the danger group for drunk driving is young men in their early 20s rather than teenagers.[69] It is not uncommon for police forces in Australia to randomly stop motorists and submit them to a Random breath test. This test involves speaking or blowing into a hand held device to give a reading. Refusing a roadside test is an offense, and is subject to the same penalty as high range drunk driving. This detection method is not employed in the UK, and it is not an offence in England or Wales for a fully licensed driver to drive with a BAC of less than 0.08% (Australia and Scotland have limits of 0.05%). Also in Australia it is an offence for any person driving on Learner or probationary ('P1 or P2') plates (aged under 20 years) to drive with any alcohol at all in their system. The BAC must be 0.00% and still remains under 0.05% for an \\"instructing a learner\\".\\r\\nUnlike the USA, these countries do not see restricting access to alcohol as having any useful role to play in reducing drunk driving. Their experience is that random breath tests, severe penalties, including imprisonment for a first offense (in UK), combined with blanket public service broadcasting are a more effective strategy.[70]\\r\\nAlso, Australian and British Law do not recognize the crime of DUI Manslaughter and sentences for causing death by drunk driving are much lower than the USA. In the UK, a judge makes a sentencing decision based on the amount of alcohol present. This can lead to imprisonment for a first offence.[71][72]\\r\\nIn Germany, a legal limit of 0.05% lowers to 0.03% if a driver is found to be at fault in a traffic accident. 0.00% is the standard for those who are under 21 years of age.[73]","field3":"What's the legal drinking limit in florida?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"231 for the Army, 62 for the Marine Corps, 198 for the Air Force, and 162 for the Navy","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"In the United States Army, United States Marine Corps, and United States Air Force, general (abbreviated as GEN in the Army or Gen in the Air Force and Marine Corps) is a four-star general officer rank, with the pay grade of O-10. General ranks above lieutenant general and below General of the Army or General of the Air Force; the Marine Corps does not have an established grade above general. General is equivalent to the rank of admiral in the other uniformed services. Since the grades of General of the Army and General of the Air Force are reserved for wartime use only, and since the Marine Corps has no five-star equivalent, the grade of general is currently considered to be the highest appointment an officer can achieve in these three services.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFormally, the term General is always used when referring to a four-star general. However, a number of different terms may be used to refer to them informally, since lower-ranking generals may also be referred to as simply General. These may include Full General, Four-star General (or simply four-star), or O-10 (in reference to pay grade).\\r\\nThe United States Code explicitly limits the total number of general officers (termed flag officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) that may be on active duty at any given time. The total number of active duty general officers is capped at 231 for the Army, 62 for the Marine Corps, 198 for the Air Force, and 162 for the Navy.[1] No more than about 25% of a service's active duty general or flag officers may have more than two stars,[2] and statute sets the total number of four-star officers allowed in each service.[2] This is set at 7 four-star Army generals, 9 four-star Air Force generals, 2 four-star Marine generals, and 6 four-star Navy admirals.[2]\\r\\nSeveral of these slots are reserved by statute. For example, the two highest-ranking members of each service (the service chief and deputy service chief) are designated as four-star generals. For the Army the Chief of Staff and the Vice Chief of Staff are four-star generals; for the Marine Corps, the Commandant and the Assistant Commandant are both four-star generals; and for the Air Force, the Chief of Staff and Vice Chief of Staff are four-star generals. In addition, for the National Guard, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau[3] is a four-star general under active duty in the Army or Air Force.\\r\\nThere are several exceptions to these limits allowing more than allotted within the statute[citation needed]:\\r\\nFinally, all statutory limits may be waived at the President's discretion during time of war or national emergency.[6]\\r\\nFour-star grades go hand-in-hand with the positions of office to which they are linked; the active rank of four-star general can only be held for so long- though upon retirement, if satisfactory service requirements are met, the general or admiral is normally allowed to hold that rank in retirement, rather than reverting to a lower position, as was formerly usually the case.[7] Their active rank expires with the expiration of their term of office, which is usually set by statute.[7] Generals are nominated for appointment by the President from any eligible officers holding the rank of brigadier general or above who meet the requirements for the position, with the advice of the Secretary of Defense, service secretary (Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, or Secretary of the Air Force), and if applicable the Joint Chiefs of Staff.[7] For some positions, statute allows the President to waive those requirements for a nominee deemed to serve national interests.[8] The nominee must be confirmed by the United States Senate before the appointee can take office and assume the rank.[7] Four-star ranks may also be given by act of Congress but this is extremely rare. The standard tour for most four-star positions is three years, bundled as a two-year term plus a one-year extension, with the following exceptions:\\r\\nExtensions of the standard tour length can be approved, within statutory limits, by their respective service secretaries, the Secretary of Defense, the President, or Congress but these are rare, as they block other officers from being promoted. Some statutory limits can be waived in times of national emergency or war.\\r\\nOther than voluntary retirement, statute sets a number of mandates for retirement. A four-star general must retire after 40 years of service unless he or she is reappointed to serve longer.[9] Otherwise all general officers must retire the month after their 64th birthday.[10] However, the Secretary of Defense can defer a four-star officer's retirement until the officer's 66th birthday[10] and the President can defer it until the officer's 68th birthday.[10]\\r\\nGeneral officers typically retire well in advance of the statutory age and service limits, so as not to impede the career paths of more junior officers. Since only a limited number of four-star slots are available to each service, typically one officer must leave office before another can be promoted.[11] Maintaining a four-star rank is a game of musical chairs: once an officer vacates a position bearing that rank, he or she has no more than 60 days to be appointed or reappointed to a position of equal or greater importance before he or she must involuntarily retire.[7][11] Historically, officers leaving four-star positions were allowed to revert to their permanent two-star ranks to mark time in lesser jobs until statutory retirement, but now such officers are expected to retire immediately to avoid obstructing the promotion flow.\\r\\nTo retire at four-star grade, an officer must accumulate at least three years of satisfactory active duty service in that grade, as certified by the Secretary of Defense.[12] The Secretary of Defense may reduce this requirement to two years, but only if the officer is not being investigated for misconduct. Officers who do not meet the service-in-grade requirement revert to the next highest grade in which they served satisfactorily for at least six months. It is extraordinarily rare for a four-star officer not to retire in that grade.\\r\\nFour-star officers typically step down from their posts up to 60 days in advance of their official retirement dates. Officers retire on the first day of the month, so once a retirement month has been selected, the relief and retirement ceremonies are scheduled by counting backwards from that date by the number of days of accumulated leave remaining to the retiring officer. During this period, termed transition leave or terminal leave, the officer is considered to be awaiting retirement but still on active duty.","field3":"How many generals does the us military have?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"December 16, 2009","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Aria Resort and Casino is a luxury resort and casino, part of the CityCenter complex on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. Aria consists of two curved glass and steel highrise towers adjoined at the center. It opened on December 16, 2009 as a joint venture between MGM Resorts International and Infinity World Development. At 4,000,000?sq?ft (370,000?m2) and 600?ft (180?m) in height, it is the largest and tallest structure at CityCenter.\\r\\nThe resort's 61 and 51-story towers contain an American Automobile Association five diamond[3] hotel with 4,004 guest rooms and suites, 16 restaurants, 10 bars and nightclubs, and a casino with 150,000?sq?ft (14,000?m2) of gaming space. It also has a 215,000?sq?ft (20,000?m2) pool area with 34 cabanas, an 80,000?sq?ft (7,400?m2) salon and spa, a 300,000?sq?ft (28,000?m2) convention center and a 1,800-seat theater which hosted Zarkana by Cirque du Soleil, until closing April 30, 2016.\\r\\nAmong the most notable aspects of Aria is its incorporation of technology in the exterior and interior design of the hotel,[4] specifically for the reduction of energy consumption. It is the largest hotel in the world to have earned LEED Gold certification.[5] On account of its smart rooms which automatically adjust curtains, turn off unused lights and electronics, and regulate the temperature when a guest enters or leaves a room, Aria was described in Popular Mechanics as possibly \\"the most technologically advanced hotel ever built\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAria was conceived by MGM Mirage (now MGM Resorts International)[7] as part of the broader CityCenter development project, which was announced on November 10, 2004. The architectural design of Aria was conducted by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects, and construction began in early 2006 on a plot of land located between the Bellagio and Monte Carlo. This site was previously occupied by the former Boardwalk Hotel and Casino, retail stores, and a large parking lot, all of which were excavated beginning in April 2006. Following excavation, Aria's foundation was poured in June 2006. Vertical progression commenced in September 2007, at which point construction workers built upwards at a rate of one floor every seven days until reaching the final height of 61 floors.[8]\\r\\nAmid ongoing construction in 2007, Infinity World Development, a subsidiary of Dubai World,[9] invested about $2.7 billion to acquire a 50% stake in the CityCenter project. From this point on, Aria was jointly owned by MGM Resorts International and Infinity World Development, with MGM solely responsible for operations and management. The economic downturn and its ripple effects ÿ including litigation ÿ threatened to halt construction of Aria at one point in early 2009,[10] but an additional funding arrangement was made, allowing construction to continue on schedule.[11] The resort opened on December 16, 2009, in the same month as several other CityCenter properties such as The Crystals, an attached retail shopping complex.[12][13]\\r\\nThe completed structure comprises two curvilinear glass towers, measuring 61 stories tall.[14] At the base of the connected high-rise towers is a casino and a three-story lobby that incorporates natural materials including foliage, flowers, glass, wood, and stone.[15] Aria's design is described as not adhering to an overarching theme, in contrast to themed resorts prevalent on the Las Vegas Strip.[16][17] It was named Aria due to its placement as the central feature of CityCenter, as arias are focal points in operas.[18]\\r\\nArtwork is incorporated throughout the lobby and interior of the building. The main entrance contains a lighted water feature called \\"Lumia\\" created by WET, which syncs water bursts to music.[19] Maya Lin, designer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., created an 87?ft (27?m) reclaimed silver sculpture of the Colorado River called Silver River which is suspended behind Aria's hotel registration desk.[8] A result of its design, Aria is the largest hotel in the world to have received LEED Gold certification.[5]\\r\\nAria contains 4,004 hotel rooms within its 4,000,000?sq?ft (370,000?m2).[20] The suites make up 568 of the rooms, and a portion are referred to as Sky Suites, a Forbes Five Star hotel. Sky Suites are categorized separately since they are accessed via a private entrance and elevator, and include transportation between the hotel and airport in limousines fueled by compressed natural gas.[21] At the time of its opening in 2009, Aria was the 9th-largest hotel in the world as measured by the total number of rooms.[22]\\r\\nAll rooms have a touch-screen automation system which automatically adjusts curtains, turns off unused lights and electronics, and regulates the temperature when a guest enters or leaves the room. Room dimensions begin at 520?sq?ft (48?m2). The standard suites range in size from 1,050 to 2,060?sq?ft (98 to 191?m2).[6][20][23] The two top floors of the hotel consist of a separately designated room category entitled Sky Villas, which range from 2,000 to 7,000?sq?ft (190 to 650?m2) in size.[24] All rooms outside the Sky Suite are non-smoking.\\r\\nA three-story, 300,000?sq?ft (28,000?m2) convention center includes four ballrooms (three with fully functioning theatrical stages), 38 meeting rooms and a three-story 400?ft (120?m) long window overlooking the pool. As of 2009, the window was the largest glass-curtain wall of its type ever constructed in a public building. An additional 900,000?sq?ft (84,000?m2) is allocated for back-of-house areas, offices, and a subterranean parking garage.[25] In December 2015, Aria announced an expansion of its convention center with construction to begin in May 2016 and completed in February 2018.[26]\\r\\nThe only casino within the CityCenter complex is located at Aria. Its 150,000?sq?ft (14,000?m2) of gaming space includes slots, poker, table games, and a race and sports book.[20] The gaming machines are controlled and monitored by a 3,000?sq?ft (280?m2) data center and are changed to play the most popular games based on real-time data collected about the performance of each machine.[6] Exterior windows are present along the edges of the casino floor and skylights are part of the ceiling in the high-limit gaming area, differing from traditional casino design which historically omits natural light.[20][27] Lemongrass, the first Thai restaurant to be opened on the Las Vegas Strip, is one of multiple restaurants located within the casino area.[28]\\r\\nLocated at the base of the Aria Casino is the 182,985?sq?ft (16,999.9?m2) Pool Deck containing one large pool surrounded by tropical landscaping and multiple smaller pools. The general Pool Deck has a security kiosk and retail shop at the entrance as well as the Breeze Cafe, Pool Bar, and 34 cabanas. The Pool Deck structures were designed by Graft's Los Angeles[29] office with structural engineering provided by Geiger Engineers,[30] exclusive of the Liquid Pool area. The cabanas are structural steel covered with tensile fabric. The Breeze Cafe and Pool Bar are sweeping canopies created by layering stucco on top of unusual curved steel skeletons. A separate outdoor pool area called LIQUID Pool Lounge was opened in March 2010.[31] The Breeze Caf at Aria Pool Deck has since closed, but guests can order food pool-side from a limited menu via a waitress.\\r\\nThere are 16 restaurants as well as 10 bars and clubs within Aria, covering a total of about 250,000?sq?ft (23,000?m2).[32] Julian Serrano, a tapas restaurant in the lobby named after its chef, was noted as one of Esquire Magazine's \\"20 Best New Restaurants in 2010\\".[33] Sage, described as a contemporary American restaurant, is also located in the lobby area.[34] Among the other restaurants led by celebrity chefs are BARMASA, a modern Japanese restaurant by Masa Takayama and a steakhouse run by Jean-Georges Vongerichten.[20][35][36]\\r\\nAn 80,000-square-foot (7,400?m2) salon and spa covers two floors of Aria, and a coed balcony attached to the spa overlooks an outdoor infinity-edge pool.[37]\\r\\nCirque du Soleil's Gold Lounge is located in the Aria Resort & Casino and is 3,756 square feet (349?m2).[38] The design is reminiscent of Elvis' mansion, Graceland, and black and gold are utilized extensively throughout the dcor. The bar has the same shape as the bar in the Elvis mansion as well.[39] The music played changes throughout the night including upbeat Classic rock, commercial House music, Elvis remixes, minimal hip-hop, Top 40, and Pop.[40] As of mid-2015, Gold Lounge is closed for remodeling and undergoing a $4 Million makeover.[41] Jewel, will replace Haze as the new nightclub in Aria.

Executive power is exercised by the King's council, the cabinet, led by the Prime Minister of Norway. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Storting, elected within a multi-party system. The Judiciary is independent of the executive branch and the legislature.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Norwegian constitution, signed by the Eidsvoll assembly on 17 May 1814, transformed Norway from being an absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. The 1814 constitution granted rights such as freedom of speech (100) and rule of law (ҡ?96, 97, 99). Important amendments include:\\r\\nNorway is a constitutional monarchy, where the King has a mainly symbolic power. The Royal House is a branch of the princely family of Glcksburg, originally from Schleswig-Holstein in Germany. The functions of the King, Harald V, are mainly ceremonial, but he has influence as the symbol of national unity. Although the constitution of 1814 grants important executive powers to the King, these are always exercised by the Council of State in the name of the King (King's Council, or cabinet). The King is also High Protector of the Church of Norway (the state church), Grand Master of The Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, and symbolically Supreme Commander of the Norwegian armed forces.\\r\\nThe Council of State is formally convened by the reigning monarch. The Council of State consists of a Prime Minister and his/her council, formally appointed by the King. Parliamentarism has evolved since 1884 and entails that the cabinet must not have the parliament against it, and that the appointment by the King is a formality. The council must have the confidence of the Norwegian legislative body, known as the Storting. In practice, the monarch will ask the leader of a parliamentary block that has a majority in the Storting to form a government. After elections resulting in no clear majority to any party or coalition, the leader of the party most likely to be able to form a government is appointed Prime Minister. Since World War II, most non-Socialist governments have been coalitions, and Labour Party governments have often relied on the support of other parties to retain the necessary parliamentary votes.\\r\\nThe executive branch is divided into the following Ministries:\\r\\nThe Labour Party has been the largest party in Parliament ever since the election of 1927 up to the recent 2013 election. Labour formed their first brief minority government in 1928 which lasted for 18 days only. After the 1936 election the Labour Party formed a new minority government, which had to go into exile 1940ÿ45 because of the German occupation of Norway. After a brief trans-party government following the German capitulation in 1945, Labour gained a majority of the seats in parliament in the first post-war election of 1945.\\r\\nNorway was ruled by Labour governments from 1945 to 1981, except for three periods (1963, 1965ÿ71, and 1972ÿ73). The Labour Party had a single party majority in the Storting from 1945 to 1961. Since then no party has single-handedly formed a majority government, hence minority and coalition governments have been the rule. After the centre-right Willoch government lost its parliamentary majority in the election of 1985, there were no majority governments in Norway until the second Stoltenberg government was formed after the 2005 election.\\r\\nFrom 1981 to 1997, governments alternated between minority Labour governments and Conservative-led centre-right governments. The centre-right governments gained power in 3 out of 4 elections during this period (1981, 1985, 1989), whereas Labour toppled those governments twice between elections (1986, 1990) and stayed in power after one election (1993). Elections take place in September and governments change in October of election years.\\r\\nConservative leader K?re Willoch formed a minority government after the election of 1981. In 1983, midway between elections, this government was expanded to a majority three-party coalition of the Conservatives, the Centre Party and the Christian Democrats. In the election of 1985 the coalition lost its majority but stayed in office until 1986, when it stepped down after losing a parliamentary vote on petrol taxes.\\r\\nLabour leader Gro Harlem Brundtland served three periods as Prime Minister. First briefly from February 1981 until the election the same year, then from May 1986 to the election of 1989, and last from November 1990 until October 1996 when she decided to step out of domestic politics. Brundtland strongly influenced Norwegian politics and society during this period and was nicknamed the \\"national mother\\".\\r\\nAfter the election of 1989 a centre-right coalition was formed with the same three parties as in 1983ÿ1986, this time headed by Conservative leader Jan P. Syse. This coalition governed from 1989 to November 1990 when it collapsed from inside over the issue of Norwegian membership in the European Economic Area.\\r\\nWhen Brundtland resigned in 1996, Labour leader Thorbj?rn Jagland formed a new Labour government that stayed in office until October 1997 when he, after the September 1997 election, declared that his government would step down because the Labour Party failed to win at least 36.9% of the national vote ÿ the percentage Labour had won in the 1993 election.\\r\\nA three-party minority coalition of the Centre, Christian Democratic, and Liberal parties, headed by Christian Democrat Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, moved into office in October 1997. That government fell in March 2000 over the issue of proposed natural gas plants, opposed by Bondevik due to their impact on climate change.\\r\\nThe Labour Party's Jens Stoltenberg, a Brundtland protg, took over in a minority Labour government but lost power in the September 2001 election when Labour posted its worst performance since World War I.\\r\\nBondevik once again became Prime Minister in 2001, this time as head of a minority coalition of the Conservatives, Christian Democrats and Liberals, a coalition dependent on support from the Progress Party. This coalition government was the first to stay in office for a complete four-year election period since Per Borten's coalition government of 1965ÿ69.\\r\\nA coalition between the Labour Party, Socialist Left Party, and Centre Party, took over from 17 October 2005[update] after the 2005 general election, where this coalition obtained a majority of 87 out of 169 seats in the Storting. Jens Stoltenberg became Prime Minister and formed a cabinet known as Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet.\\r\\nThis was a historical coalition in several aspects. It was the first time the Socialist Left sat in cabinet, the first time the Labour Party sat in a coalition government since the 1945 four-month post-war trans-party government (otherwise in government alone), and the first time the Centre Party sat in government along with socialist parties (otherwise in coalition with conservative and other centre parties).\\r\\nIn the 2009 general election the coalition parties kept the majority in the Storting by winning 86 out of 169 seats.[1] Stoltenberg's second cabinet thus continued. There have been several reshuffles in the cabinet during its existence.\\r\\nIn the 2013 election, the incumbent redÿgreen coalition government obtained 72 seats and lost its majority. The election ended with a victory for the four opposition non-socialist parties, winning a total of 96 seats out of 169 (85 needed for a majority). Following convention, Stoltenberg's government resigned and handed over power in October 2013. The Labour Party, however, remained the largest party in parliament with 30.8% of the popular vote. The Progress Party also lost ground, but nevertheless participates in the new cabinet. Among the smaller parties, the centrist Liberal Party and Christian Peoples Party hold the balance of power. Both campaigned on a change in government. On September 30 the two smaller parties announced that they would support a minority coalition of the Conservative and Progress parties, but they would not take seats in the cabinet themselves. The new Erna Solberg government was re-elected in 2017.\\r\\nNorway has a unicameral Parliament, the Storting (\\"Great Council\\"), with members elected by popular vote for a four-year term (during which it may not be dissolved) by proportional representation in multi-member constituencies. Voting rights are granted in the year a person turns 18.\\r\\nThe Storting currently has 169 members (increased from 165, effective from the elections of 12 September 2005). The members are elected from the 19 counties for 4-year terms according to a system of proportional representation. Until 2009, the Storting divided itself into two chambers, the Odelsting and the Lagting for the sole purpose of voting on legislation. Laws were proposed by the government through a Member of the Council of State or by a member of the Odelsting and decided on by the Odelsting and Lagting, in case of repeated disagreement by the joint Storting. In practice, the Lagting rarely disagreed and mainly just rubber-stamped the Odelsting's decision. In February 2007, the Storting passed a constitutional amendment to repeal the division, which abolished the Lagting for the 2009 general election, thereby establishing a fully unicameral system.[2]\\r\\nElections are to be held every 4 years on the second Monday of September.\\r\\nThe Norwegian legal system is a mixture of customary law, civil law system, and common law traditions; the Supreme Court renders advisory opinions to legislature when asked; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction, with reservations.\\r\\nThe regular courts include the Supreme Court (H?yesterett) with 18 permanent judges and a president, courts of appeal (court of second instance in most cases), city and county courts (court of first instance in most cases), and conciliation councils (court of first instance in most civil-code cases). Judges attached to the regular courts are appointed by the King in council after nomination by the Ministry of Justice.\\r\\nThe special High Court of the Realm (Riksrett) hears impeachment cases against members of the Government, Parliament, or Supreme Court. Following an amendment to the Norwegian constitution in February 2007, impeachment cases are heard by the five highest ranking Supreme Court justices and six lay members in one of the Supreme Court courtrooms The High Court of the Realm had generally lost most of its significance after 1884, and this institution has been passive ever since 1927. The new system is meant to restore the Riksrett to its earlier significance.\\r\\nImpeachment may be brought against Members of the Council of State, or of the Supreme Court or of the Storting, for criminal offenses which they may have committed in their official capacity. Indictments are raised by the Storting and judged by five Supreme Court justices and six lay judges.\\r\\nThe mainland of Norway is divided into 19 counties (fylker, singular fylke): Akershus, Aust-Agder, Buskerud, Finnmark, Hedmark, Hordaland, M?re og Romsdal, Nordland, Nord-Tr?ndelag, Oppland, Oslo, ?stfold, Rogaland, Sogn og Fjordane, S?r-Tr?ndelag, Telemark, Troms, Vest-Agder, and Vestfold. In addition are the island group Svalbard and the island Jan Mayen.\\r\\nCounties and municipalities have local autonomy, but this autonomy is circumscribed by national controls. Counties and municipalities are subject to the oversight of a governor (fylkesmann) appointed by the King in the Council of State. One governor exercises authority in both Oslo and the adjacent county of Akershus. Each county has a directly elected county assembly, led by a mayor, which decides upon matters falling within purview of the counties (upper secondary and vocational education, some culture, transport and social services). There is also a governor (sysselmann) on Svalbard, who is under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and not the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development as the other counties.\\r\\nThe counties are divided into 428 municipalities (kommuner, singular kommune). The municipalities are led by directly elected assemblies, which elect a board of aldermen and a mayor. Some municipalities, most notably Oslo, have a parliamentary system of government, where the city council elects a city government that is responsible for executive functions. Some municipalities are also divided into municipal districts or city districts (again, Oslo is one of these) responsible for certain welfare and culture services. These districts are also headed by political assemblies, in some cases elected directly by the citizens. The municipalities deal with a wide range of planning issues and welfare services, and are mostly free to engage in activities which are not explicitly restricted by law. Lately, the functions of the counties and municipalities have been the subject of debates, and changes may take place in the near future.\\r\\nNorway has three dependent areas, all in or near Antarctica: Bouvet Island in the South Atlantic Ocean, Queen Maud Land in Antarctica, and Peter I Island off West Antarctica. The Norwegian Act of 27 February 1930 declares these areas are subject to Norwegian sovereignty as dependencies.\\r\\nAn attempt to annex East Greenland ended in defeat at the Hague Tribunal in 1933.\\r\\nAfDB, AsDB, Australia Group, BIS, CBSS, CE, CERN, EAPC, EBRD, ECE, EFTA, ESA, FAO, IADB, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICCt, ICC, ICFTU, ICRM, IDA, IEA, IFAD, IFC, International IDEA, IFRCS, IHO, ILO, IMF, International Maritime Organization, Inmarsat, Intelsat, Interpol, IOC, IOM, ISO, ITU, MINURSO, NAM (guest), NATO, NC, NEA, NIB, NSG, OECD, OPCW, OSCE, PCA, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNHCR, UNIDO, UNMIBH, UNMIK, UNMOP, UNTSO, UPU, WCO, WEU (associate), WHO, WIPO, WMO, WTO, Zangger Committee.","field3":"What form of government is used in norway?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"5 September 1914","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"U-boat is the anglicised version of the German word U-Boot [?u?bo?t]?(?listen), a shortening of Unterseeboot, literally \\"undersea boat\\".[1] While the German term refers to any submarine, the English one (in common with several other languages) refers specifically to military submarines operated by Germany, particularly in the First and Second World Wars. Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships, they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role (commerce raiding) and enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping. The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada and other parts of the British Empire, and the United States to the United Kingdom and (during the Second World War) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean.\\r\\nAustro-Hungarian navy submarines were also known as U-boats.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first submarine built in Germany, the three-man Brandtaucher, sank to the bottom of Kiel harbor on 1 February 1851 during a test dive.[2][3] The inventor and engineer Wilhelm Bauer had designed this vessel in 1850, and Schweffel & Howaldt constructed it in Kiel. Dredging operations in 1887 rediscovered Brandtaucher; it was later raised and put on historical display in Germany.\\r\\nThere followed in 1890 the boats WW1 and WW2, built to a Nordenfelt design. In 1903 the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel completed the first fully functional German-built submarine, Forelle,[4] which Krupp sold to Russia during the Russo-Japanese War in April 1904.[5] The SM U-1 was a completely redesigned Karp-class submarine and only one was built. The Imperial German Navy commissioned it on 14 December 1906.[6] It had a double hull, a K?rting kerosene engine, and a single torpedo tube. The 50%-larger SM U-2 (commissioned in 1908) had two torpedo tubes. The U-19 class of 1912ÿ13 saw the first diesel engine installed in a German navy boat. At the start of World War I in 1914, Germany had 48 submarines of 13 classes in service or under construction. During that war the Imperial German Navy used SM U-1 for training. Retired in 1919, it remains on display at the Deutsches Museum in Munich.[7]\\r\\nOn 5 September 1914, HMS?Pathfinder was sunk by SM?U-21, the first ship to have been sunk by a submarine using a self-propelled torpedo. On 22 September, U-9 sank the obsolete British warships HMS?Aboukir, HMS?Cressy and HMS?Hogue (the \\"Live Bait Squadron\\") in a single hour.\\r\\nIn the Gallipoli Campaign in early 1915 in the eastern Mediterranean, German U-boats, notably the U-21, prevented close support of allied troops by 18 pre-Dreadnought battleships by sinking two of them.[8]\\r\\nFor the first few months of the war, U-boat anticommerce actions observed the \\"prize rules\\" of the time, which governed the treatment of enemy civilian ships and their occupants. On 20 October 1914, SM?U-17 sank the first merchant ship, the SS?Glitra, off Norway.[9] Surface commerce raiders were proving to be ineffective, and on 4 February 1915, the Kaiser assented to the declaration of a war zone in the waters around the British Isles. This was cited as a retaliation for British minefields and shipping blockades. Under the instructions given to U-boat captains, they could sink merchant ships, even potentially neutral ones, without warning.\\r\\nIn February 1915, a submarine U-6 (Lepsius) was rammed and both periscopes were destroyed off Beachy Head by the collier SS Thordis commanded by Captain John Bell RNR after firing a torpedo.[10] On 7 May 1915, SM?U-20 sank the liner RMS Lusitania. The sinking claimed 1,198 lives, 128 of them American civilians, and the attack of this unarmed civilian ship deeply shocked the Allies. According to the ship's manifest, Lusitania was carrying military cargo, though none of this information was relayed to the citizens of Britain and the United States who thought that the ship contained no ammunition or military weaponry whatsoever and it was an act of brutal murder. Munitions that it carried were thousands of crates full of ammunition for rifles, 3-inch artillery shells, and also various other standard ammunition used by infantry. The sinking of the Lusitania was widely used as propaganda against the German Empire and caused greater support for the war effort. A widespread reaction in the U.S was not seen until the sinking of the ferry SS?Sussex. The sinking occurred in 1915 and the United States entered the war in 1917.\\r\\nThe initial U.S. response was to threaten to sever diplomatic ties, which persuaded the Germans to issue the Sussex pledge that reimposed restrictions on U-boat activity. The U.S. reiterated its objections to German submarine warfare whenever U.S. civilians died as a result of German attacks, which prompted the Germans to fully reapply prize rules. This, however, removed the effectiveness of the U-boat fleet, and the Germans consequently sought a decisive surface action, a strategy that culminated in the Battle of Jutland.\\r\\nAlthough the Germans claimed victory at Jutland, the British Grand Fleet remained in control at sea. It was necessary to return to effective anticommerce warfare by U-boats. Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, Commander in Chief of the High Seas Fleet, pressed for all-out U-boat war, convinced that a high rate of shipping losses would force Britain to seek an early peace before the United States could react effectively.\\r\\nThe renewed German campaign was effective, sinking 1.4 million tons of shipping between October 1916 and January 1917. Despite this, the political situation demanded even greater pressure, and on 31 January 1917, Germany announced that its U-boats would engage in unrestricted submarine warfare beginning 1 February. On 17 March, German submarines sank three American merchant vessels, and the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917.\\r\\nUnrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917 was initially very successful, sinking a major part of Britain-bound shipping. Nevertheless, with the introduction of escorted convoys, shipping losses declined and in the end the German strategy failed to destroy sufficient Allied shipping. An armistice became effective on 11 November 1918 and all surviving German submarines were surrendered. Of the 360 submarines that had been built, 178 were lost, but more than 11 million tons of shipping had been destroyed. Of the 178 submarines destroyed, SM U-103 was sunk when the troopship RMS Olympic rammed it as it attempted to crash-dive, killing all on board.\\r\\nUnder the terms of armistice, all U-boats were to immediately surrender. Those in home waters sailed to the British submarine base at Harwich. The entire process was done quickly and in the main without difficulty, after which the vessels were studied, then scrapped or given to Allied navies. Stephen King-Hall wrote a detailed eyewitness account of the surrender.[11]\\r\\nAt the end of World War I, as part of the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, the Treaty of Versailles restricted the total tonnage of the German surface fleet. The treaty also restricted the independent tonnage of ships and forbade the construction of submarines. However, a submarine design office was set up in the Netherlands and a torpedo research program was started in Sweden. Before the start of World War II, Germany started building U-boats and training crews, labeling these activities as \\"research\\" or concealing them using other covers. When this became known, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement limited Germany to parity with Britain in submarines. When World War II started, Germany already had 65 U-boats, with 21 of those at sea, ready for war.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring World War II, U-boat warfare was the major component of the Battle of the Atlantic, which lasted the duration of the war. Germany had the largest submarine fleet of the revived German War Navy (Kriegsmarine) since 1935 into World War II (1939-1945), since the Armistice of November 11th, 1918, scuttled most of the old Imperial German Navy from the First World War and the following Treaty of Versailles of 1919, had limited the surface navy of Germany's new Weimar Republic to only six battleships (of less than 10,000 tons each), six cruisers, and 12 destroyers.[12] British Prime Minister Winston Churchill later wrote \\"The only thing that really frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril.\\"\\r\\nIn the early stages of the war the U-boats were extremely effective in destroying Allied shipping due to the large gap in mid-Atlantic air cover. Cross-Atlantic trade in war supplies and food was extensive and critical for Britain's survival. The continuous action surrounding British shipping became known as the Battle of the Atlantic, as the British developed technical defences such as ASDIC and radar, and the German U-boats responded by hunting in what were called \\"wolfpacks\\" where multiple submarines would stay close together, making it easier for them to sink a specific target. Britain's vulnerable shipping situation existed until 1942, when the tides changed as the U.S. merchant marine and Navy entered the war, drastically increasing the amount of tonnage of supplies sent across the Atlantic. The combination of increased tonnage and increased naval protection of shipping convoys made it much more difficult for U-boats to make a significant dent in British shipping. Once the United States entered the war, U-boats ranged from the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, and from the Arctic to the west and southern African coasts and even as far east as Penang. The U.S. military engaged in various tactics against German incursions in the Americas; these included military surveillance of foreign nations in Latin America, particularly in the Caribbean, to deter any local governments from supplying German U-boats.\\r\\nBecause speed and range were severely limited underwater while running on battery power, U-boats were required to spend most of their time surfaced running on diesel engines, diving only when attacked or for rare daytime torpedo strikes. The more ship-like hull design reflects the fact that these were primarily surface vessels that could submerge when necessary. This contrasts with the cylindrical profile of modern nuclear submarines, which are more hydrodynamic underwater (where they spend the majority of their time), but less stable on the surface. While U-boats were faster on the surface than submerged, the opposite is generally true of modern submarines. The most common U-boat attack during the early years of the war was conducted on the surface and at night. This period, before the Allied forces developed truly effective antisubmarine warfare tactics, which included convoys, was referred to by German submariners as \\"die glckliche Zeit\\" or The First Happy Time[13]\\r\\nThe U-boats' main weapon was the torpedo, though mines and deck guns (while surfaced) were also used. By the end of the war, almost 3,000 Allied ships (175 warships; 2,825 merchant ships) were sunk by U-boat torpedoes.[14] Early German World War II torpedoes were straight runners, as opposed to the homing and pattern-running torpedoes that were fielded later in the war. They were fitted with one of two types of pistol triggers: impact, which detonated the warhead upon contact with a solid object, and magnetic, which detonated upon sensing a change in the magnetic field within a few meters.\\r\\nOne of the most effective uses of magnetic pistols would be to set the torpedo's depth to just beneath the keel of the target. The explosion under the target's keel would create a detonation shock wave, which could cause a ship's hull to rupture under the concussive water pressure. In this way, even large or heavily armored ships could be sunk or disabled with a single, well-placed hit.\\r\\nIn practice, however, the depth-keeping equipment and magnetic and contact exploders were notoriously unreliable in the first eight months of the war. Torpedoes often ran at an improper depth, detonated prematurely, or failed to explode altogethersometimes bouncing harmlessly off the hull of the target ship. This was most evident in Operation Weserbung, the invasion of Norway, where various skilled U-boat commanders failed to inflict damage on British transports and warships because of faulty torpedoes. The faults were largely due to a lack of testing. The magnetic detonator was sensitive to mechanical oscillations during the torpedo run, and to fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field at high latitudes. These were eventually phased out, and the depth-keeping problem was solved by early 1942.[15]\\r\\nLater in the war, Germany developed an acoustic homing torpedo, the G7/T5. It was primarily designed to combat convoy escorts. The acoustic torpedo was designed to run straight to an arming distance of 400 m and then turn toward the loudest noise detected. This sometimes ended up being the U-boat itself; at least two submarines may have been sunk by their own homing torpedoes. Additionally, these torpedoes were found to be only effective against ships moving at greater than 15 knots (28?km/h). The Allies countered acoustic torpedoes with noisemaker decoys such as Foxer, FXR, CAT and Fanfare. The Germans, in turn, countered this by introducing newer and upgraded versions of the acoustic torpedoes, like the late-war G7es, and the T11 torpedo. However, the T11 torpedoes did not see active service.[16]\\r\\nU-boats also adopted several types of \\"pattern-running\\" torpedoes that ran straight out to a preset distance, then traveled in either a circular or ladder-like pattern. When fired at a convoy, this increased the probability of a hit if the weapon missed its primary target.\\r\\nDuring World War II, the Kriegsmarine produced many different types of U-boats as technology evolved. Most notable is the Type VII, known as the \\"workhorse\\" of the fleet, which was by far the most-produced type, and the Type IX boats, which were larger versions of the VII designed for long-range patrols, some traveling as far as Japan and the east coast of the United States.\\r\\nWith the increasing sophistication of Allied detection and subsequent losses, German designers began to fully realise the potential for a truly submerged boat. The Type XXI \\"Elektroboot\\" was designed to favor submerged performance, both for combat effectiveness and survival. It was the first true submersible. The Type XXI featured an evolutionary design that combined several different strands of the U-Boat development program, most notably from the Walter U-boats, the Type XVII, which featured an unsuccessful yet revolutionary hydrogen peroxide air-independent propellant system. These boats featured a streamlined hull design, which formed the basis of the later USS?Nautilus nuclear submarine, and was adapted for use with more conventional propulsion systems. The larger hull design allowed for a greatly increased battery capacity, which enabled the XXI to cruise submerged for longer periods and reach unprecedented submerged speeds for the time.\\r\\nThroughout the war, an arms race evolved between the Allies and the Kriegsmarine, especially in detection and counterdetection. Sonar (ASDIC in Britain) allowed Allied warships to detect submerged U-boats (and vice versa) beyond visual range, but was not effective against a surfaced vessel; thus, early in the war, a U-boat at night or in bad weather was actually safer on the surface. Advancements in radar became particularly deadly for the U-boat crews, especially once aircraft-mounted units were developed. As a countermeasure, U-boats were fitted with radar warning receivers, to give them ample time to dive before the enemy closed in, as well as more anti aircraft guns. However, by early to mid-1943, the Allies switched to centimetric radar (unknown to Germany), which rendered the radar detectors ineffective. U-boat radar systems were also developed, but many captains chose not to use them for fear of broadcasting their position to enemy patrols and lack of sufficient electronic countermeasures.\\r\\nEarly on, the Germans experimented with the idea of the Schnorchel (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines, but saw no need for them until rather late in the war. The Schnorchel was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at periscope depth, allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. Problems occurred with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Waste disposal was a problem when the U-boats spent extended periods without surfacing, as it is today. Speed was limited to 8 knots (15?km/h), lest the device snap from stress. The Schnorchel also had the effect of making the boat essentially noisy and deaf in sonar terms. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the Schnorchel mast could be detected beyond visual range.\\r\\nSeveral other pioneering innovations included acoustic- and electro-absorbent coatings to make them less of an ASDIC or RADAR target. The Germans also developed active countermeasures such as facilities to release artificial chemical bubble-making decoys, known as Bold, after the mythical kobold.\\r\\nAdvances in convoy tactics, high-frequency direction finding (referred to as \\"Huff-Duff\\"), radar, active sonar (called ASDIC in Britain), depth charges, ASW spigot mortars (also known as \\"hedgehog\\"), the intermittent cracking of the German Naval Enigma code, the introduction of the Leigh light, the range of escort aircraft (especially with the use of escort carriers), the use of mystery ships, and the full entry of the U.S. into the war with its enormous shipbuilding capacity, all turned the tide against the U-boats. In the end, the U-boat fleet suffered extremely heavy casualties, losing 793 U-boats and about 28,000 submariners (a 75% casualty rate, the highest of all German forces during the war).\\r\\nAt the same time, the Allies targeted the U-boat shipyards and their bases with strategic bombing.\\r\\nThe British had a major advantage in their ability to read some German naval Enigma codes. An understanding of the German coding methods had been brought to Britain via France from Polish code-breakers. Thereafter, code books and equipment were captured by raids on German weather ships and from captured U-boats. A team including Alan Turing used special purpose \\"Bombes\\" and early computers to break new German codes as they were introduced. The speedy decoding of messages was vital in directing convoys away from wolf packs and allowing interception and destruction of U-boats. This was demonstrated when the Naval Enigma machines were altered in February 1942 and wolf-pack effectiveness greatly increased until the new code was broken.\\r\\nThe German submarine?U-110, a Type IXB, was captured in 1941 by the Royal Navy, and its Enigma machine and documents were removed. U-559 was also captured by the British in October 1942; three sailors boarded her as she was sinking, and desperately threw all the code books out of the submarine so as to salvage them. Two of them, Able Seaman Colin Grazier and Lieutenant Francis Anthony Blair Fasson, continued to throw code books out of the ship as it went under water, and went down with it. Further code books were captured by raids on weather ships. U-744 was boarded by crew from the Canadian ship HMCS?Chilliwack on 6 March 1944, and codes were taken from her, but by this time in the war, most of the information was known.[17] The U-505, a Type IXC, was captured by the United States Navy in June 1944. It is now a museum ship in Chicago at the Museum of Science and Industry.\\r\\nTwo events in the battle took place in 1942 when German U-boats attacked four allied ore carriers at Bell Island, Newfoundland. The carriers SS?Saganaga and SS?Lord Strathcona were sunk by U-513 on 5 September 1942, while the SS?Rosecastle and PLM 27 were sunk by U-518 on 2 November with the loss of 69 lives. When the submarine launched a torpedo at the loading pier, Bell Island became the only location in North America to be subject to direct attack by German forces in World War II.\\r\\n\\"Operation Deadlight\\" was the code name for the scuttling of U-boats surrendered to the Allies after the defeat of Germany near the end of the war. Of the 154 U-boats surrendered, 121 were scuttled in deep water off Lisahally, Northern Ireland, or Loch Ryan, Scotland, in late 1945 and early 1946.\\r\\nM?ltenort U-Boat Memorial\\r\\nFrom 1955, the West German Bundesmarine was allowed to have a small navy. Initially two sunken Type XXIIIs and a Type XXI were raised and repaired. In the 1960s, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) re-entered the submarine business. Because West Germany was initially restricted to a 450 tonne displacement limit, the Bundesmarine focused on small coastal submarines to protect against the Soviet Union (Russian) threat in the Baltic Sea. The Germans sought to use advanced technologies to offset the small displacement, such as amagnetic steel to protect against naval mines and magnetic anomaly detectors.\\r\\nThe initial Type 201 was a failure because of hull cracking; the subsequent Type 205, first commissioned in 1967, was a success, and 12 were built for the German navy. To continue the U-boat tradition, the new boats received the classic U designation starting with the U-1.\\r\\nWith the Danish government's purchase of two Type 205 boats, the West German government realized the potential for the submarine as an export. Three of the improved Type 206 boats were later sold to the Israeli Navy, becoming the Gal-class. The German Type 209 diesel-electric submarine was the most popular export-sales submarine in the world from the late 1960s into the first years of the 21st century. With a larger 1,000ÿ1,500 tonne displacement, the class was very customizable and has seen service with 14 navies with 51 examples being built as of 2006.\\r\\nGermany has brought the U-boat name into the 21st century with the new Type 212. The 212 features an air-independent propulsion system using hydrogen fuel cells. This system is safer than previous closed-cycle diesel engines and steam turbines, cheaper than a nuclear reactor and quieter than either. While the Type 212 is also being purchased by Italy, the Type 214 has been designed as the follow-on export model and has been sold to Greece, South Korea and Turkey.\\r\\nIn July 2006, Germany commissioned its newest U-boat, the U-34, a Type 212.","field3":"When were u boats first used in ww1?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Series 5","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eleventh Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television programme Doctor Who.

Smith's incarnation is a quick-tempered but compassionate man whose youthful appearance is at odds with his more discerning and world-weary temperament.

He also frequently appeared alongside River Song (Alex Kingston), a fellow time traveller with whom he shared a romantic storyline, and was the last Doctor to appear alongside the long-serving companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) prior to the actress' death, featuring in two episodes of the spin-off programme The Sarah Jane Adventures.\\r\\n\\r\\nExecutive producer and head writer Steven Moffat on Smith's casting.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Tennant announced at the National Television Awards on 29 October 2008 that he would be stepping down from portraying the Doctor because he felt that the four years he spent portraying the character was enough.[6] At the time, BBC News published that Paterson Joseph, who appeared in the Doctor Who episodes \\"Bad Wolf\\" and \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", was the bookmakers' favourite to succeed Tennant,[7] followed by David Morrissey, who would be appearing in the 2008 Christmas special, \\"The Next Doctor\\".  Other candidates included Sean Pertwee, son of Third Doctor actor Jon Pertwee;[8] Russell Tovey, who portrayed Alonso Frame in the 2007 Christmas special, \\"Voyage of the Damned\\";[9] and James McAvoy.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Steven Moffat anticipated choosing a middle-aged actor for the new Doctor,[11] Smith was aged 26 when cast. This made him the youngest actor to portray the Doctor, three years younger than Peter Davison was at the time he began his role as the Fifth Doctor. Show producers were cautious about casting Smith because they felt that a 26-year-old could not play the Doctor adequately; BBC Wales Head of Drama Piers Wenger shared the sentiment, but noted that Smith was capable enough to play the role.[5][12] Smith's casting in the role was revealed during an episode of Doctor Who's companion show Doctor Who Confidential, during which he described the role as \\"a wonderful privilege and challenge that I hope I will thrive on\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eleventh Doctor spends most of his first full episode, \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", in the tattered remains of the Tenth Doctor's clothing, leading young Amelia Pond to nickname him \\"the Raggedy Doctor.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor's initial outfit, chosen within the narrative of \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" from an array of clothes found in a hospital, is a brown tweed jacket with elbow patches, bow tie, braces, black trousers and black, ankle-high boots. He has a fondness for bow ties and fezzes, proclaiming them as \\"cool.\\"[13] The details of the outfit vary, switching from a braces and bow tie combination in red to the same in blue. In later stories, a green military coat makes its way into the Doctor's ensemble, occasionally replacing the Harris jacket. On other occasions he does not wear a coat and wears a bow-tie and dress shirt. After the Doctor loses his original tweed jacket in the episode \\"Flesh and Stone\\" he replaces it with a plain brown jacket which he wears until the Christmas special \\"A Christmas Carol\\", which aired the Christmas after the eleventh Doctor's first series. In this episode the Doctor wears his most famous \\"Prince of Wales check\\" tweed jacket which he wears, with some switching to a green military coat, until parting ways with Amy and Rory in \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn \\"The Big Bang\\", the Doctor briefly dons a fez, stating, \\"I wear a fez now, fezzes are cool.\\" This began a running gag with \\"cool\\" headgear, including a Stetson hat, a Victorian-era top hat, and the recurring fez. After appearing in Victorian period clothing throughout \\"The Snowmen\\", the Doctor rejects his tweed jacket (\\"The Bells of Saint John\\") in favour of a purple-brown cashmere frock coat and a variety of waistcoats, and generally more sober colours of shirt and bow tie. Amy Pond's reading glasses, which were left behind with the Doctor after Amy and Rory's departure in the episode \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\", are also occasionally worn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview with Doctor Who Magazine, Steven Moffat revealed that the Eleventh Doctor had an entirely different costume until close to the start of filming. The original look had a swashbuckling feel which Doctor Who Magazine editor Tom Spilsbury described as \\"a little like something Captain Jack Sparrow wears in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies\\". However, Matt Smith was unhappy with the costume as he felt it reflected how someone else would dress the Doctor, rather than how the Doctor would dress himself. Smith also mentioned in a 2012 interview that his Doctor was going to have a \\"very long black leather jacket, but it was too Matrix-style\\".[14] The eventual costume, in particular the bow-tie, was influenced by Patrick Troughton's Second Doctor, after Matt Smith fell in love with the Troughton story The Tomb of the Cybermen.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSteven Moffat describes the Eleventh Doctor as an \\"old man trapped in a young man's body\\" and Matt Smith characterises him as someone with \\"a lot of blood on his hands\\" who copes via constant travelling and thrill-seeking.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depictions of the personalities of the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors shared certain similarities[18][19] e.g. both being youthful, energetic, friendly, childlike, \\"good boyfriend Doctors\\", as Steven Moffat described them[20] and, according to Mark Gatiss \\"very human Doctors\\" when compared to other incarnations.[21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eleventh Doctor first appears in the final scene of The End of Time (2010) when his previous incarnation regenerates. Smith debuts fully in \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", where he first meets Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) as a child while investigating a mysterious crack in her wall. Many years later, Amy joins the Doctor as his travelling companion on the eve of her marriage to Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill). In \\"Victory of the Daleks\\", he is tricked into spawning a new generation of Daleks. In \\"The Time of Angels\\"/\\"Flesh and Stone\\", he re-encounters future companion River Song (Alex Kingston) and his enemies the Weeping Angels, and learns that cracks like the one in Amy's wall are erasing individuals entirely from time and space. After Amy attempts to seduce the Doctor, the Doctor recruits Rory as a second companion from \\"The Vampires of Venice\\" up until \\"Cold Blood\\", where he is killed protecting the Doctor and is erased from history. The Doctor also confronts his dark side in \\"Amy's Choice\\", where he is put through trials by a manifestation of his self-loathing, the Dream Lord (Toby Jones). In the final episodes \\"The Pandorica Opens\\" and \\"The Big Bang\\", an unknown force makes the TARDIS explode, causing the universe to collapse in on itself. Though he closes the cracks reversing their effects and preventing the explosion the Doctor himself is erased from history. River assists Amy in remembering the Doctor back into existence; he returns at her wedding to Rory, and the couple rejoin him as his companions. He next appears later in Death of the Doctor, a two-part story of spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures, alongside former companions Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) and Jo Grant (Katy Manning), while Amy and Rory are on honeymoon.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeries 6 in 2011 continues to examine mysteries left unexplained at the end of Series 5.[24] In \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\"/\\"Day of the Moon\\", Amy, Rory and River witness a future version of the Doctor murdered, which they vow to keep a secret from the present-day Doctor as they encounter hypnotic aliens called \\"the Silence\\". Eventually, Amy unknowingly lets slip that the Doctor dies in \\"The Almost People\\", when it also turns out that she is pregnant and has been kidnapped by the nefarious Madame Kovarian (Frances Barber). In \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\", the Doctor calls in old favours from across time and space to raise an army to rescue Amy from Demons Run, an asteroid in the 52nd century being used as a base by a religious order, but is unable to rescue her child, Melody Pond. The Doctor also learns that Melodythough Rory and Amy's childis part Time Lord due to being conceived in the TARDIS, and will grow up to become River Song. In \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\", the Doctor encounters a younger iteration of River and learns she has been conditioned by the Silence, explained to be a religious order, to assassinate him. She nearly succeeds using a kiss of poisoned lipstick before Amy convinces her to save his life instead. The Doctor also learns the circumstances of his death from historical records on a time-travelling shape-shifting robot ship called the Teselecta. In \\"The God Complex\\", the Doctor leaves Amy and Rory on Earth when he realises Amy's apotheosis of him endangers their lives. Some time passes before the Doctor is ready to confront his death. In \\"The Wedding of River Song\\", he devises an escape by concealing himself within the Teselecta, which is disguised to look like him, to make it seem he is shot and burned as history records. In a doomed alternate reality caused by River's reluctance to shoot the Doctor, the two become married; during the ceremony, she is let in on the Doctor's original plan and helps fake and corroborate his death. The Doctor is then warned by his old friend Dorium Maldovar (Simon Fisher Becker) that more prophecies still concern him. The Doctor learns he will be asked the oldest question in the universe, \\"Doctor who?\\", on the battlefields of Trenzalore; the Silence had intended his death to prevent this.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Christmas special \\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\\" (2011), the Doctor has Christmas dinner with Amy and Rory, who had been informed by River of his survival. They unite again in the Series 7 premiere \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\" (2012), in which the Doctor is erased from the Daleks' memory banks due to the actions of Oswin Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman), a young woman turned Dalek who had retained her human mind; she subsequently dies. The Doctor then takes Amy and Rory on several adventures, eventually taking them back on as full-time companions in \\"The Power of Three\\" before losing them during the events of \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\". The Doctor subsequently \\"retires\\" to a secluded lifestyle in Victorian London, until the 2012 Christmas special \\"The Snowmen,\\" when he is inspired to save the world by a barmaid/governess called Clara (Coleman) who he considers an ideal companion. Mid-adventure, Clara dies, and when the Doctor sees her tombstone, reading \\"Clara Oswin Oswald\\", he realises that Oswin and Clara are the same woman in different moments of time. He resolves to find her again in another era. The Doctor succeeds in \\"The Bells of Saint John\\", saving a present-day version of Clara Oswald from agents of the Great Intelligence. He takes her as his companion and attempts to solve the mystery of \\"the Impossible Girl\\". The Doctor eventually gets his answer in \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" when he is forced by the Great Intelligence to go to Trenzalore, revealed to be planet on which the Doctor will die. Within the Doctor's tomb, the Great Intelligence uses the dead Doctor's remnantshis disembodied \\"timestream\\"to spread himself across the Doctor's history, turning his victories into defeats. Clara pursues him and is scattered throughout the Doctor's timeline creating Oswin Oswald and Clara Oswin Oswald among numerous other incarnations who undo the Great Intelligence's work. The Doctor has a mournful conversation with River's apparition, giving her closure before entering the timeline to retrieve Clara. However, once he saves her, the Doctor is forced to reveal the existence of a previous incarnation (John Hurt) who broke the promise represented by the name \\"Doctor\\"  during the Time War of his past.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the show's 50th anniversary special, while investigating a strange occurrence in beneath London's National Gallery, the Doctor encounters his past incarnation who fought in the Time War (John Hurt) as well as his immediate previous incarnation (David Tennant). Though the older Doctors berate the 'War Doctor' for his killing both Time Lords and Daleks with a sentient weapon known as the Moment, they ultimately choose to support his decision and forgive themselves for this past atrocity. Led by the Moment into the midst of the Time War, the Doctors realise they have the potential to change its outcome and enlist the aid of their previous incarnations in an uncertain bid to save Gallifrey from destruction. They place the planet in stasis and transport it to a pocket universe, making it appear to be destroyed. As an effect of time travel, only the Eleventh Doctor will remember saving Gallifrey; he learns from a cryptic curator (played by Tom Baker) that his plan worked.[26] In \\"The Time of the Doctor,\\" the Doctor is lured to what he learns is the planet Trenzalore to decode what he discovers is a message from the displaced Time Lords through the last remaining crack in the universe: the oldest question in the universe, \\"Doctor who?\\". Learning that the verification of his identity would allow the Time Lords to return, the Doctor finds out that the signal caught the attention of an assortment of his enemies, who wish to prevent Gallifrey's return, and the powerful Church of the Papal Mainframe, who wish to destroy the planet and avoid the possibility of a new Time War. After attempting to send Clara back to her time, the Doctor spends centuries defending the planet from alien incursions. During this time, a faction of the Church led by the Silence breaks away and attempts to avert these events by destroying the Doctor earlier in his timeline, as seen in series 5 and 6. The Doctor also reveals to Clara he has no regenerations remaining and will likely die in the siege. The siege escalates into all-out war and after centuries pass, only the Daleks remain. Though the heavily aged Doctor anticipates his predestined death on the battlefields of Trenzalore, Clara convinces the Time Lords to give the Doctor a new regeneration cycle as he uses a fiery blast of regenerative energy to destroy the Dalek mothership. The Doctor regains his youth before retiring to the TARDIS to complete the process. He hallucinates a final farewell to Amy Pond and delivers a eulogy to his present incarnation, before abruptly completing his transition into the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi). He made a reappearance in \\"Deep Breath\\" (2014).  While adjusting to the new Doctor, Clara receives a phone call from the Eleventh Doctor made moments prior to their final meeting.  He asks her to help his new self and not to be afraid of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the Tenth Doctor, the Eleventh and Amy (and later Rory) appear in New Series Adventures novels in 2010. The first of these is Apollo 23 by Justin Richards, as well as the Decide Your Destiny series of interactive novels.  The character also appears in comic books published in Doctor Who Magazine, Doctor Who Adventures, and he took over from the Tenth Doctor in IDW Publishing's Doctor Who series before BBC Worldwide awarded the license to Titan Magazines. He'll continue to appear in these, as will the Tenth and Twelfth Doctors in their own stories.[27] He appeared in the crossover series Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2, where he was working with the crew of the Enterprise-D to defeat a Borg/Cybermen alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eleventh Doctor also appears in a series of audiobooks. The first release of these is The Runaway Train by Oli Smith.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eleventh Doctor is the first of the Doctors to appear in full-on action adventure games. Doctor Who: The Adventure Games is composed of four stories (\\"episodes\\"), produced alongside the 2010 series. Smith and Gillan lent their voices and likenesses. The first, City of the Daleks, carries on from the TV episode \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" and is a stealth and puzzle game set in 1960s Earth and the Dalek planet of Skaro. The second, Blood of the Cybermen, is the Eleventh Doctor and Amy's first Cyberman story. The third episode is the video game TARDIS, and the fourth is The Shadows of the Vashta Nerada, featuring the titular enemy return in an underwater setting. The fifth Adventure Game The Gunpowder Plot was released on 31 October 2011, again featuring Matt Smith's voice.\\r\\nIn May 2012, The Eternity Clock was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PC, starring Matt Smith and Alex Kingston.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nMatt Smith's portrayal of the Doctor was met with critical acclaim. Martin Anderson of Shadowlocked claimed him to be the best Doctor since \\"Tom Baker practically redefined the character in the 1970s\\".[29] Smith's performance in \\"Flesh and Stone\\" was acclaimed by fans and critics. In his review for The Daily Telegraph, Gavin Fuller noted that \\"Matt Smith's 'quick-paced delivery' is 'a major facet' of the success of the current series.\\"[30] In his review of \\"The Big Bang\\", Fuller once again praised Smith's acting.  \\"Matt Smith was superb in his scenes where the Doctor sacrifices himself in the Pandorica to rescue the multiverse\\".[31] Kyle Anderson of Nerdist wrote \\"I don't know about you all, but the Eleventh Doctor was MY Doctor.\\"[32] Dan Martin of The Guardian also claimed Smith as \\"my ultimate Doctor.\\"[33]","field3":"Which season did matt smith became the doctor?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"October 17, 1979","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The United States Department of Education (ED or DoED), also referred to as the ED for (the) Education Department, is a Cabinet-level department of the United States government. Recreated by the Department of Education Organization Act (Public Law 96-88) and signed into law by President Jimmy Carter on October 17, 1979, it began operating on May 4, 1980.[2]\\r\\nThe Department of Education Organization Act divided the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare into the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services. The Department of Education is administered by the United States Secretary of Education. It has approximately 4,400 employees and an annual budget of $68 billion (2016).[1]\\r\\nThe agency's official abbreviation is \\"ED\\", because \\"DOE\\" instead refers to the United States Department of Energy. It is also often abbreviated informally as \\"DoEd\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary functions of the Department of Education are to \\"establish policy for, administer and coordinate most federal assistance to education, collect data on US schools, and to enforce federal educational laws regarding privacy and civil rights.\\"[3] The Department of Education does not establish schools or colleges.[4]\\r\\nUnlike the systems of most other countries, education in the United States is highly decentralized, and the federal government and Department of Education are not heavily involved in determining curricula or educational standards (with the recent exception of the No Child Left Behind Act). This has been left to state and local school districts. The quality of educational institutions and their degrees is maintained through an informal private process known as accreditation, over which the Department of Education has no direct public jurisdictional control.\\r\\nThe Department's mission is: to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.[5] Aligned with this mission of ensuring equal access to education, the Department of Education is a member of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness,[6] and works with federal partners to ensure proper education for homeless and runaway youth in the United States.\\r\\nOpposition to the Department of Education mainly stems from conservatives, who see the department as an undermining of states rights, and libertarians who believe it results in a state-imposed leveling towards the bottom and low value for taxpayers' money.[7]\\r\\nFor 2006, the ED discretionary budget was $56 billion and the mandatory budget contained $23 billion.[9] In 2009 it received additional ARRA funding of $102 billion.[10] As of 2011, the discretionary budget is $70 billion.[9]\\r\\nA previous Department of Education was created in 1867 but was soon demoted to an Office in 1868.[11][12] As an agency not represented in the president's cabinet, it quickly became a relatively minor bureau in the Department of the Interior. In 1939, the bureau was transferred to the Federal Security Agency, where it was renamed the Office of Education. In 1953, the Federal Security Agency was upgraded to cabinet-level status as the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.\\r\\nIn 1979, President Carter advocated for creating a cabinet-level Department of Education.[13] Carter's plan was to transfer most of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's education-related functions to the Department of Education.[13] Carter also planned to transfer the education-related functions of the departments of Defense, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, as well as a few other federal entities.[13] Among the federal education-related programs that were not proposed to be transferred were Headstart, the Department of Agriculture's school lunch and nutrition programs, the Department of the Interior's Native Americans' education programs, and the Department of Labor's education and training programs.[13]\\r\\nUpgrading Education to cabinet level status in 1979 was opposed by many in the Republican Party, who saw the department as unconstitutional, arguing that the Constitution doesn't mention education, and deemed it an unnecessary and illegal federal bureaucratic intrusion into local affairs. However, many see the department as constitutional under the Commerce Clause, and that the funding role of the Department is constitutional under the Taxing and Spending Clause. The National Education Association supported the bill, while the American Federation of Teachers opposed it.[14]\\r\\nAs of 1979, the Office of Education had 3,000 employees and an annual budget of $12 billion.[15] Congress appropriated to the Department of Education an annual budget of $14 billion and 17,000 employees when establishing the Department of Education.[16] During the 1980 presidential campaign, Gov. Reagan called for the total elimination of the U.S. Department of Education, severe curtailment of bilingual education, and massive cutbacks in the federal role in education. Once in office, President Reagan succeeded significantly to reduce the budget.[17]\\r\\nThe Republican Party platform of 1980 called for the elimination of the Department of Education created under Carter and President Ronald Reagan promised during the 1980 presidential election to eliminate it as a cabinet post,[18] but he was not able to do so with a Democratic House of Representatives.[19] In the 1982 State of the Union Address, he pledged: \\"The budget plan I submit to you on Feb. 8 will realize major savings by dismantling the Department of Education.\\"[19]\\r\\nBy 1984 the GOP had dropped the call for elimination from its platform, and with the election of President George H. W. Bush the Republican position evolved in almost lockstep with that of the Democrats, with Goals 2000 a virtual joint effort.\\r\\nAfter the Newt Gingrich-led \\"revolution\\" in 1994 had taken control of both Houses of Congress, federal control of and spending on education soared. That trend continued unabated despite the fact that the Republican Party made abolition of the Department a cornerstone of 1996 platform and campaign promises, calling it an inappropriate federal intrusion into local, state, and family affairs.[19] The GOP platform read: \\"The Federal government has no constitutional authority to be involved in school curricula or to control jobs in the market place. This is why we will abolish the Department of Education, end federal meddling in our schools, and promote family choice at all levels of learning.\\"[19][20] During his 1996 presidential run, Senator Bob Dole promised, \\"We're going to cut out the Department of Education.\\"[20]\\r\\nIn 2000, the Republican Liberty Caucus passed a resolution to abolish the Department of Education.[21] Abolition of the organization was not pursued under the George W. Bush administration, which made reform of federal education a key priority of the President's first term. In 2008 and 2012, presidential candidate Ron Paul campaigned in part on an opposition to the Department.[22]\\r\\nUnder President George W. Bush, the Department primarily focused on elementary and secondary education, expanding its reach through the No Child Left Behind Act. The Department's budget increased by $14 billion between 2002 and 2004, from $46 billion to $60 billion.[19]\\r\\nOn March 23, 2007, President George W. Bush signed into law H.R. 584, which designates the ED Headquarters building as the Lyndon B. Johnson Department of Education Building.[24]\\r\\nOn February 7, 2017, Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) introduced H.R. 899, a bill to abolish the department. Massie's bill, which is one sentence long, states, \\"The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2018.\\"[25]","field3":"When was the us department of education established?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Athens, Greece","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The 1896 Summer Olympics (Greek: ɚ? Ѯϫ? ʽ?? 1896, Therino Olympiako Ag܇nes 1896), officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad, was the first international Olympic Games held in modern history. Organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which had been created by Pierre de Coubertin, it was held in Athens, Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896.\\r\\nWinners were given a silver medal, while runners-up received a copper medal. Retroactively, the IOC has converted these to gold and silver, and awarded bronze medals to third placed athletes. Ten of the 14 participating nations earned medals. The United States won the most gold medals, 11; host nation Greece won the most medals overall, 46. The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by their compatriot Spyridon Louis. The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnast Carl Schuhmann, who won four events.\\r\\nAthens had been unanimously chosen to stage the inaugural modern Games during a congress organised by Coubertin in Paris on 23 June 1894, during which the IOC was also created, because Greece was the birthplace of the Ancient Olympic Games. The main venue was the Panathenaic Stadium, where athletics and wrestling took place; other venues included the Neo Phaliron Velodrome for cycling, and the Zappeion for fencing. The opening ceremony was held in the Panathenaic Stadium on 6 April, during which most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organising committee, Crown Prince Constantine, his father officially opened the Games. Afterwards, nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an Olympic Hymn, composed by Spyridon Samaras, with words by poet Kostis Palamas.\\r\\nThe 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. The Panathenaic Stadium, the only Olympic stadium used in the 1800s, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.[3] After the Games, Coubertin and the IOC were petitioned by several prominent figures, including Greece's King George and some of the American competitors in Athens, to hold all the following Games in Athens. However, the 1900 Summer Olympics were already planned for Paris and, except for the Intercalated Games of 1906, the Olympics did not return to Greece until the 2004 Summer Olympics, 108 years later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 19th century, several small-scale sports festivals across Europe were named after the Ancient Olympic Games. The 1870 Olympics at the Panathenaic stadium, which had been refurbished for the occasion, had an audience of 30,000 people.[4] Pierre de Coubertin, a French pedagogue and historian, adopted Dr William Penny Brookes' idea to establish a multi-national and multi-sport eventthe ancient games only allowed male athletes of Greek origin to participate.[5][6] In 1890, Coubertin wrote an article in La Revue Athletique, which espoused the importance of Much Wenlocka rural market town in the English county of Shropshire. It was here that, in October 1850, the local physician William Penny Brookes had founded the Wenlock Olympian Games, a festival of sports and recreations that included athletics and team sports, such as cricket, football and quoits.[7] Coubertin also took inspiration from the earlier Greek games organised under the name of Olympics by businessman and philanthropist Evangelis Zappas in 1859, 1870 and 1875.[8] The 1896 Athens Games was funded by the legacies of Evangelis Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas[9][10][11] and by George Averoff[12] who had been specifically requested by the Greek government, through crown prince Constantine, to sponsor the second refurbishment of the Panathenaic Stadium. This the Greek government did despite the fact that the cost of refurbishing the stadium in marble had already been funded in full by Evangelis Zappas forty years earlier.[13]\\r\\nWith deep feeling towards Baron de Coubertin's courteous petition, I send him and the members of the Congress, with my sincere thanks, my best wishes for the revival of the Olympic Games.\\r\\nOn 18 June 1894, Coubertin organised a congress at the Sorbonne, Paris, to present his plans to representatives of sports societies from 11 countries. Following his proposal's acceptance by the congress, a date for the first modern Olympic Games needed to be chosen. Coubertin suggested that the Games be held concurrently with the 1900 Universal Exposition of Paris. Concerned that a six-year waiting period might lessen public interest, congress members opted instead to hold the inaugural Games in 1896. With a date established, members of the congress turned their attention to the selection of a host city. It remains a mystery how Athens was finally chosen to host the inaugural Games. In the following years both Coubertin and Demetrius Vikelas would offer recollections of the selection process that contradicted the official minutes of the congress. Most accounts hold that several congressmen first proposed London as the location, but Coubertin dissented. After a brief discussion with Vikelas, who represented Greece, Coubertin suggested Athens. Vikelas made the Athens proposal official on 23 June, and since Greece had been the original home of the Olympics, the congress unanimously approved the decision. Vikelas was then elected the first president of the newly established International Olympic Committee (IOC).[15]\\r\\nNews that the Olympic Games would return to Greece was well received by the Greek public, media, and royal family. According to Coubertin, \\"the Crown Prince Constantine learned with great pleasure that the Games will be inaugurated in Athens.\\" Coubertin went on to confirm that, \\"the King and the Crown Prince will confer their patronage on the holding of these games.\\" Constantine later conferred more than that; he eagerly assumed the presidency of the 1896 organising committee.[16]\\r\\nHowever, the country had financial troubles and was in political turmoil. The job of prime minister alternated between Charilaos Trikoupis and Theodoros Deligiannis frequently during the last years of the 19th century. Because of this financial and political instability, both prime minister Trikoupis and Stephanos Dragoumis, the president of the Zappas Olympic Committee, which had attempted to organise a series of national Olympiads, believed that Greece could not host the event.[17] In late 1894, the organising committee under Stephanos Skouloudis presented a report that the cost of the Games would be three times higher than originally estimated by Coubertin. They concluded the Games could not be held, and offered their resignation. The total cost of the Games was 3,740,000 gold drachmas.[18]\\r\\nWith the prospect of reviving the Olympic games very much in doubt, Coubertin and Vikelas commenced a campaign to keep the Olympic movement alive. Their efforts culminated on 7 January 1895 when Vikelas announced that crown prince Constantine would assume the presidency of the organising committee. His first responsibility was to raise the funds necessary to host the Games. He relied on the patriotism of the Greek people to motivate them to provide the required finances.[19] Constantine's enthusiasm sparked a wave of contributions from the Greek public. This grassroots effort raised 330,000 drachmas. A special set of postage stamps were commissioned; the sale of which raised 400,000 drachmas. Ticket sales added 200,000 drachmas. At the request of Constantine, businessman George Averoff agreed to pay for the restoration of the Panathenaic Stadium. Averoff would donate 920,000 drachmas[12] to this project.[20] As a tribute to his generosity, a statue of Averoff was constructed and unveiled on 5 April 1896 outside the stadium. It stands there to this day.[21]\\r\\nSome of the athletes would take part in the Games because they happened to be in Athens at the time the Games were held, either on holiday or for work (e.g., some of the British competitors worked for the British embassy). A designated Olympic Village for the athletes did not appear until the 1932 Summer Olympics. Consequently, the athletes had to provide their own lodging.\\r\\nThe first regulation voted on by the new IOC in 1894 was to allow only amateur athletes to participate in the Olympic Games.[22] The various contests were thus held under amateur regulations with the exception of fencing matches.[23] The rules and regulations were not uniform, so the Organising Committee had to choose among the codes of the various national athletic associations. The jury, the referees and the game director bore the same names as in antiquity (Ephor, Helanodic and Alitarc). Prince George acted as final referee; according to Coubertin, \\"his presence gave weight and authority to the decisions of the ephors.\\"[24]\\r\\nSeven venues were used for the 1896 Summer Olympics. Panathenaic Stadium was the main venue, hosting four of the nine sports contested. The city of Marathon served as host to the marathon event and the individual road race events. Swimming was held in the Bay of Zea, fencing at the Zappeion, sport shooting at Kallithea, and tennis at the Athens Lawn Tennis Club. Tennis was a sport unfamiliar to Greeks at the time of the 1896 Games.[25]\\r\\nThe Bay of Zea is a seaport and marina in the Athens area;[26] it was used as the swimming venue because the organizers of the Games wanted to avoid spending money on constructing a special purpose swimming venue.[27]\\r\\nFour of the 1896 venues were reused as competition venues for the 2004 Games. The velodrome would be renovated into a football stadium in 1964 and was known as Karaiskakis Stadium.[28] This venue was renovated in 2003 for use as a football venue for the 2004 Games.[29] During the 2004 Games, Panathinaiko Stadium served as host for archery competitions and was the finish line for the athletic marathon event.[30] The city of Marathon itself served as the starting point for both marathon events during the 2004 Games.[31] The Zappeion served as the first home of the organizing committee (ATHOC) for the 2004 Games from 1998 to 1999, and served as the main communications center during those Games.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\n? The iconic Olympic rings symbol was not designed by Baron Pierre de Coubertin until 1912.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 April (25 March according to the Julian calendar then in use in Greece), the games of the First Olympiad were officially opened; it was Easter Monday for both the Western and Eastern Christian Churches and the anniversary of Greece's independence.[40] The Panathenaic Stadium was filled with an estimated 80,000 spectators, including King George I of Greece, his wife Olga, and their sons. Most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organising committee, Crown Prince Constantine, his father officially opened the Games with the words (in Greek):[41]\\r\\n\\"I declare the opening of the first international Olympic Games in Athens. Long live the Nation. Long live the Greek people.\\"\\r\\nAfterwards, nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an Olympic Hymn, composed by Spyridon Samaras, with words by poet Kostis Palamas. Thereafter, a variety of musical offerings provided the backgrounds to the Opening Ceremonies until 1960, since which time the Samaras/Palamas composition has become the official Olympic Anthem (decision taken by the IOC Session in 1958). Other elements of current Olympic opening ceremonies were initiated later: the Olympic flame was first lit in 1928, the first athletes' oath was sworn at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and the first officials' oath was taken at the 1972 Olympic Games.[41]\\r\\nAt the 1894 Sorbonne congress, a large roster of sports were suggested for the program in Athens. The first official announcements regarding the sporting events to be held featured sports such as football and cricket,[42] but these plans were never finalised, and these sports did not make the final list for the Games.[43] Rowing and yachting were scheduled, but had to be cancelled due to poor weather on the planned day of competition.[44] As a result, the 1896 Summer Olympics programme featured 9 sports encompassing 10 disciplines and 43 events. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.\\r\\nThe athletics events had the most international field of any of the sports. The major highlight was the marathon, held for the first time in international competition. Spyridon Louis, a previously unrecognised water carrier, won the event to become the only Greek athletics champion and a national hero. Although Greece had been favoured to win the discus and the shot put, the best Greek athletes finished just behind the American Robert Garrett in both events.[3]\\r\\nNo world records were set, as few top international competitors had elected to compete. In addition, the curves of the track were very tight, making fast times in the running events virtually impossible. Despite this, Thomas Burke, of the United States, won the 100-meter race in 12.0 seconds and the 400-meter race in 54.2 seconds. Burke was the only one who used the \\"crouch start\\" (putting his knee on soil), confusing the jury. Eventually, he was allowed to start from this \\"uncomfortable position\\".[45]\\r\\nAustralian competitor Edwin Flack came to Athens to watch the games, but decided to compete in the athletics events. He won two racesthe 800-meter and the 1500-meter.\\r\\nChile claims one athlete, Luis Subercaseaux, competed for the nation at the 1896 Summer Olympics. This makes Chile one of the 14 nations to appear at the inaugural Summer Olympic Games. Subercaseaux's results are not listed in the official report, though that report typically includes only winners and Subercaseaux won no medals.[46][46] A study conducted by Chilean forensic police decided (by use of facial recognition), that Subercaseaux was the participant in a famous photo of 100 meter's second series.[47]\\r\\nThe rules of the International Cycling Association were used for the cycling competitions.[48] The track cycling events were held at the newly built Neo Phaliron Velodrome. Only one road event was held, a race from Athens to Marathon and back (87 kilometres).\\r\\nIn the track events, the best cyclist was Frenchman Paul Masson, who won the one lap time trial, the sprint event, and the 10,000 meters. In the 100 kilometres event, Masson entered as a pacemaker for his compatriot Lon Flameng. Flameng won the event, after a fall, and after stopping to wait for his Greek opponent Georgios Kolettis to fix a mechanical problem. The Austrian fencer Adolf Schmal won the 12-hour race, which was completed by only two cyclists, while the road race event was won by Aristidis Konstantinidis.[49]\\r\\nThe fencing events were held in the Zappeion, which, built with money Evangelis Zappas had given to revive the ancient Olympic Games, had never seen any athletic contests before.[50] Unlike other sports (in which only amateurs were allowed to take part at the Olympics), professionals were authorised to compete in fencing, though in a separate event. These professionals were considered gentlemen athletes, just as the amateurs.[24]\\r\\nFour events were scheduled, but the pe event was cancelled for unknown reasons. The foil event was won by a Frenchman, Eugne-Henri Gravelotte, who beat his countryman, Henri Callot, in the final.[50] The other two events, the sabre and the masters foil, were won by Greek fencers. Leonidas Pyrgos, who won the latter event, became the first Greek Olympic champion in the modern era.\\r\\nThe gymnastics competition was carried out on the infield of the Panathinaiko Stadium. Germany had sent an 11-man team, which won five of the eight events, including both team events. In the team event on the horizontal bar, the German team was unopposed. Three Germans added individual titles: Hermann Weing?rtner won the horizontal bar event, Alfred Flatow won the parallel bars; and Carl Schuhmann, who also competed successfully in wrestling, won the vault. Louis Zutter, a Swiss gymnast, won the pommel horse, while Greeks Ioannis Mitropoulos and Nikolaos Andriakopoulos were victorious in the rings and rope climbing events, respectively.[51]\\r\\nA regatta of sailing boats was on the program of the Games of the First Olympiad for 31 March 1896. However this event had to be given up.\\r\\nThe Official English report states:\\r\\nThe Regatta could not take place because some special boats embarkation had not been provided for.\\r\\nThe German version gives a bit more clues:\\r\\nDie Wettk?mpfe im Segeln wurden vereitelt, da man weder bei uns die besonderen Boote dafr besass, noch fremde Bewerber sich gemeldet hatten.\\r\\nHeld at a range at Kallithea, the shooting competition consisted of five eventstwo using a rifle and three with the pistol. The first event, the military rifle, was won by Pantelis Karasevdas, the only competitor to hit the target with all of his shots. The second event, for military pistols, was dominated by two American brothers: John and Sumner Paine became the first siblings to finish first and second in the same event. To avoid embarrassing their hosts, the brothers decided that only one of them would compete in the next pistol event, the free pistol. Sumner Paine won that event, thereby becoming the first relative of an Olympic champion to become Olympic champion himself.[52]\\r\\nThe Paine brothers did not compete in the 25-meter pistol event, as the event judges determined that their weapons were not of the required calibre. In their absence, Ioannis Phrangoudis won. The final event, the free rifle, began on the same day. However, the event could not be completed due to darkness and was finalised the next morning, when Georgios Orphanidis was crowned the champion.[52]\\r\\nThe swimming competition was held in the open sea because the organizers had refused to spend the money necessary for a specially constructed stadium. Nearly 20,000 spectators lined the Bay of Zea off the Piraeus coast to watch the events. The water in the bay was cold, and the competitors suffered during their races. There were three open events (men's 100-metre freestyle, men's 500-metre freestyle, and men's 1200 metre freestyle), in addition to a special event open only to Greek sailors, all of which were held on the same day (11 April).[49]\\r\\nFor Alfrd Haj܇s of Hungary, this meant he could only compete in two of the events, as they were held too close together, which made it impossible for him to adequately recuperate. Nevertheless, he won the two events in which he swam, the 100 and 1200 meter freestyle. Haj܇s later became one of only two Olympians to win a medal in both the athletic and artistic competitions, when he won a silver medal for architecture in 1924. The 500-meter freestyle was won by Austrian swimmer Paul Neumann, who defeated his opponents by more than a minute and a half.\\r\\nAlthough tennis was already a major sport by the end of the 19th century, none of the top players turned up for the tournament in Athens. The competition was held at the courts of the Athens Lawn Tennis Club, and the infield of the velodrome used for the cycling events. John Pius Boland, who won the event, had been entered in the competition by a fellow-student of his at Oxford; the Greek, Konstantinos Manos. As a member of the Athens Lawn Tennis sub-committee, Manos had been trying, with the assistance of Boland, to recruit competitors for the Athens Games from among the sporting circles of Oxford University. In the first round, Boland defeated Friedrich Traun, a promising tennis player from Hamburg, who had been eliminated in the 100-meter sprint competition. Boland and Traun decided to team up for the doubles event, in which they reached the final and defeated their Greek and Egyptian opponents after losing the first set.[53]\\r\\nThe sport of weightlifting was still young in 1896, and the rules differed from those in use today. Competitions were held outdoors, in the infield of the main stadium, and there were no weight limits. The first event was held in a style now known as the \\"clean and jerk\\". Two competitors stood out: Scotsman Launceston Elliot and Viggo Jensen of Denmark. Both of them lifted the same weight; but the jury, with Prince George as the chairman, ruled that Jensen had done so in a better style. The British delegation, unfamiliar with this tie-breaking rule, lodged a protest. The lifters were eventually allowed to make further attempts, but neither lifter improved, and Jensen was declared the champion.[54]\\r\\nElliot got his revenge in the one hand lift event, which was held immediately after the two-handed one. Jensen had been slightly injured during his last two-handed attempt, and was no match for Elliot, who won the competition easily. The Greek audience was charmed by the Scottish victor, whom they considered very attractive. A curious incident occurred during the weightlifting event: a servant was ordered to remove the weights, which appeared to be a difficult task for him. Prince George came to his assistance; he picked up the weight and threw it a considerable distance with ease, to the delight of the crowd.[54]\\r\\nNo weight classes existed for the wrestling competition, held in the Panathenaic Stadium, which meant that there would only be one winner among competitors of all sizes. The rules used were similar to modern Greco-Roman wrestling, although there was no time limit, and not all leg holds were forbidden (in contrast to current rules).\\r\\nApart from the two Greek contestants, all the competitors had previously been active in other sports. Weightlifting champion Launceston Elliot faced gymnastics champion Carl Schuhmann. The latter won and advanced into the final, where he met Georgios Tsitas, who had previously defeated Stephanos Christopoulos. Darkness forced the final match to be suspended after 40 minutes; it was continued the following day, when Schuhmann needed only fifteen minutes to finish the bout.[55]\\r\\nOn the morning of Sunday 12 April (or 3 April, according to the Julian calendar then used in Greece), King George the Great organised a banquet for officials and athletes (even though some competitions had not yet been held). During his speech, he made clear that, as far as he was concerned, the Olympics should be held in Athens permanently. The official closing ceremony was held the following Wednesday, after being postponed from Tuesday due to rain. Again the royal family attended the ceremony, which was opened by the national anthem of Greece and an ode composed in ancient Greek by George S. Robertson, a British athlete and scholar.[56]\\r\\nAfterwards, the king awarded prizes to the winners. Unlike today, the first-place winners received a silver medal, an olive branch and a diploma, while runners-up received a copper medal, a laurel branch, and diploma.[57][58] Third place winners did not receive a prize.\\r\\nSome winners also received additional prizes, such as Spyridon Louis, who received a cup from Michel Bral, a friend of Coubertin, who had conceived the marathon event. Louis then led the medalists on a lap of honour around the stadium, while the Olympic Hymn was played again. The King then formally announced that the first Olympiad was at an end, and left the Stadium, while the band played the Greek national hymn and the crowd cheered.[56]\\r\\nLike the Greek king, many others supported the idea of holding the next Games in Athens; most of the American competitors signed a letter to the Crown Prince expressing this wish. Coubertin, however, was heavily opposed to this idea, as he envisioned international rotation as one of the cornerstones of the modern Olympics. According to his wish, the next Games were held in Paris, although they would be somewhat overshadowed by the concurrently held Universal Exposition.[59]\\r\\nThe concept of national teams was not a major part of the Olympic movement until the Intercalated Games 10 years later, though many sources list the nationality of competitors in 1896 and give medal counts. There are significant conflicts with regard to which nations competed. The International Olympic Committee gives a figure of 14, but does not list them.[41] The following 14 are most likely the ones recognised by the IOC. Some sources list 12, excluding Chile and Bulgaria; others list 13, including those two but excluding Italy. Egypt is also sometimes included because of Dionysios Kasdaglis' participation. Belgium and Russia had entered the names of competitors, but withdrew.\\r\\nTen of the 14 participating nations earned medals, in addition to three medals won by mixed teams, i.e. teams made up of athletes from multiple nations. The IOC has retroactively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to the three best placed athletes in each event to comport with more recent traditions.[67] The United States won the most gold medals* (11), while host nation Greece won the most medals overall (46) as well as the most silver* (17) and bronze* (19) medals, finishing with one fewer gold medal than the United States.[67]\\r\\nTo sort this table by nation, total medal count, or any other column, click on the  icon next to the column title.\\r\\nKey ??Host nation (Greece)\\r\\nWomen were not entitled to compete at the 1896 Summer Olympics, because de Coubertin felt that their inclusion would be \\"impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic and incorrect\\".[71] However, one woman, Stamata Revithi, ran the marathon course on 11 April, the day after the men had run the official race. Although she was not permitted to enter the stadium at the end of her race, Revithi finished the marathon in about five hours and 30 minutes, and found witnesses to sign their names and verify the starting and finishing times. Revithi intended to present this documentation to the Hellenic Olympic Committee, hoping that they would recognise her achievement. Neither her reports nor documents from the Hellenic Olympic Committee have been discovered to provide corroboration.[72]","field3":"Where was the first modern olympic games held?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Paul Wesley","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPawe?

He started his theater studies in New  York City and transferred from Marlboro High School to Lakewood Prep School in Howell, New Jersey, because the school was able to better accommodate his acting schedule. During his junior year in high school, he was cast in the soap opera Guiding Light as character Max Nickerson.[5][7][8] He started college at Rutgers University in New Jersey but left after one semester when more roles were offered to him, and he realized he could make a career out of acting.[5][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the years, he has appeared in a variety of films.

Wesley began directing The Vampire Diaries in its fifth season and produced the series at the start of season 8.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe directed episode 16 in season 2 of Shadowhunters for Freeform. In November 2016, it was announced that under the label of his newly formed production company, Citizen Media, Wesley signed a deal with Warner Bros.

The term is often mistakenly used as a synonym for the Internet itself, but the Web is a service that operates over the Internet, just as e-mail also does. The history of the Internet dates back significantly further than that of the World Wide Web.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypertext portion of the Web in particular has an intricate intellectual history; notable influences and precursors include Vannevar Bush's Memex,[3] IBM's Generalized Markup Language,[4] and Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu.[3]\\r\\nPaul Otlet's Mundaneum project has also been named as an early 20th century precursor of the Web.[5]\\r\\nThe concept of a global information system connecting homes is prefigured in \\"A Logic Named Joe\\", a 1946 short story by Murray Leinster, in which computer terminals, called \\"logics,\\" are present in every home. Although the computer system in the story is centralized, the story anticipates a ubiquitous information environment similar to the Web. The cultural impact of the web was imagined even further back in a short story by E. M. Forster, \\"The Machine Stops,\\" first published in 1909.\\r\\nIn 1980, Tim Berners-Lee, an English independent contractor at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland, built ENQUIRE, as a personal database of people and software models, but also as a way to play with hypertext; each new page of information in ENQUIRE had to be linked to an existing page.[3]\\r\\nBerners-Lee's contract in 1980 was from June to December, but in 1984 he returned to CERN in a permanent role, and considered its problems of information management: physicists from around the world needed to share data, yet they lacked common machines and any shared presentation software.\\r\\nShortly after Berners-Lee's return to CERN, TCP/IP protocols were installed on some key non-Unix machines at the institution, turning it into the largest Internet site in Europe within a few years. As a result, CERN's infrastructure was ready for Berners-Lee to create the Web.[6]\\r\\nBerners-Lee wrote a proposal in March 1989 for \\"a large hypertext database with typed links\\".[7] Although the proposal attracted little interest, Berners-Lee was encouraged by his boss, Mike Sendall, to begin implementing his system on a newly acquired NeXT workstation.[8] He considered several names, including Information Mesh,[7] The Information Mine or Mine of Information, but settled on World Wide Web.[9]\\r\\nBerners-Lee found an enthusiastic supporter in Robert Cailliau. Berners-Lee and Cailliau pitched Berners-Lee's ideas to the European Conference on Hypertext Technology in September 1990, but found no vendors who could appreciate his vision of marrying hypertext with the Internet.[10]\\r\\nBy Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 0.9,[11] the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the first Web browser (named WorldWideWeb, which was also a Web editor), the first HTTP server software (later known as CERN httpd), the first web server (http://info.cern.ch), and the first Web pages that described the project itself. The browser could access Usenet newsgroups and FTP files as well. However, it could run only on the NeXT; Nicola Pellow therefore created a simple text browser, called the Line Mode Browser, that could run on almost any computer.[12] To encourage use within CERN, Bernd Pollermann put the CERN telephone directory on the web  previously users had to log onto the mainframe in order to look up phone numbers.[12]\\r\\nWhile inventing and working on setting up the Web, Berners-Lee spent most of his working hours in Building 31 (second floor) at CERN (461357N 60242E? / ?46.2325N 6.0450E? / 46.2325; 6.0450? (CERN Building 31, Birthplace of the World Wide Web)), but also at his two homes, one in France, one in Switzerland.[13] In January 1991 the first Web servers outside CERN itself were switched on.[14]\\r\\nThe first web page may be lost, but Paul Jones of UNC-Chapel Hill in North Carolina revealed in May 2013 that he has a copy of a page sent to him in 1991 by Berners-Lee which is the oldest known web page. Jones stored the plain-text page, with hyperlinks, on a floppy disk and on his NeXT computer.[15] CERN put the oldest known web page back online in 2014, complete with hyperlinks that helped users get started and helped them navigate what was then a very small web.[16][17]\\r\\nOn August 6, 1991,[18] Berners-Lee posted a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the alt.hypertext newsgroup, inviting collaborators.[19] This date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web servers, which had occurred months earlier.\\r\\nPaul Kunz from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center visited CERN in September 1991, and was captivated by the Web. He brought the NeXT software back to SLAC, where librarian Louise Addis adapted it for the VM/CMS operating system on the IBM mainframe as a way to display SLACs catalog of online documents;[12] this was the first web server outside of Europe and the first in North America.[20] The www-talk mailing list was started in the same month.[14]\\r\\nIn 1992 the Computing and Networking Department of CERN, headed by David Williams, did not support Berners-Lee's work. A two-page email sent by Williams stated that the work of Berners-Lee, with the goal of creating a facility to exchange information such as results and comments from CERN experiments to the scientific community, was not the core activity of CERN and was a misallocation of CERN's IT resources. Following this decision, Tim Berners-Lee left CERN despite many of his peers in the IT center advocating for his support (in particular M. Ben Segal from the distributed computing SHIFT project). He left for MIT, where he continued to develop the HTTP protocol.\\r\\nAn early CERN-related contribution to the Web was the parody band Les Horribles Cernettes, whose promotional image is believed to be among the Web's first five pictures.[21]\\r\\nIn keeping with its birth at CERN and the first page opened, early adopters of the World Wide Web were primarily university-based scientific departments or physics laboratories such as Fermilab and SLAC. By January 1993 there were fifty Web servers across the world; by October 1993 there were over five hundred.[14] Two of the earliest webcomics started on the World Wide Web in 1993: Doctor Fun and NetBoy.[22][23]\\r\\nEarly websites intermingled links for both the HTTP web protocol and the then-popular Gopher protocol, which provided access to content through hypertext menus presented as a file system rather than through HTML files. Early Web users would navigate either by bookmarking popular directory pages, such as Berners-Lee's first site at http://info.cern.ch/, or by consulting updated lists such as the NCSA \\"What's New\\" page. Some sites were also indexed by WAIS, enabling users to submit full-text searches similar to the capability later provided by search engines.\\r\\nBy the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still minute compared to present figures, but quite a number of notable websites were already active, many of which are the precursors or inspiring examples of today's most popular services.\\r\\nInitially, a web browser was available only for the NeXT operating system. This shortcoming was discussed in January 1992,[14] and alleviated in April 1992 by the release of Erwise, an application developed at the Helsinki University of Technology, and in May by ViolaWWW, created by Pei-Yuan Wei, which included advanced features such as embedded graphics, scripting, and animation.[12] ViolaWWW was originally an application for HyperCard. Both programs ran on the X Window System for Unix.[12] In 1992, the first tests between browsers on different platforms were concluded successfully between buildings 513 and 31 in CERN, between browsers on the NexT station and the X11-ported Mosaic browser.\\r\\nStudents at the University of Kansas adapted an existing text-only hypertext browser, Lynx, to access the web. Lynx was available on Unix and DOS, and some web designers, unimpressed with glossy graphical websites, held that a website not accessible through Lynx wasnt worth visiting.\\r\\nThe first Microsoft Windows browser was Cello, written by Thomas R. Bruce for the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School to provide legal information, since access to Windows was more widespread amongst lawyers than access to Unix. Cello was released in June 1993.[12]\\r\\nThe Web was first popularized by Mosaic,[24] a graphical browser launched in 1993 by Marc Andreessen's team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).[25] The origins of Mosaic date to 1992. In November 1992, the NCSA at the University of Illinois (UIUC) established a website. In December 1992, Andreessen and Eric Bina, students attending UIUC and working at the NCSA, began work on Mosaic with funding from the High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative, a US-federal research and development program.[26] Andreessen and Bina released a Unix version of the browser in February 1993; Mac and Windows versions followed in August 1993.[14] The browser gained popularity due to its strong support of integrated multimedia, and the authors rapid response to user bug reports and recommendations for new features.\\r\\nAfter graduation from UIUC, Andreessen and James H. Clark, former CEO of Silicon Graphics, met and formed Mosaic Communications Corporation in April 1994, to develop the Mosaic Netscape browser commercially. The company later changed its name to Netscape, and the browser was developed further as Netscape Navigator.\\r\\nIn May 1994, the first International WWW Conference, organized by Robert Cailliau,[27][10] was held at CERN;[28] the conference has been held every year since. In April 1993, CERN had agreed that anyone could use the Web protocol and code royalty-free; this was in part a reaction to the perturbation caused by the University of Minnesota's announcement that it would begin charging license fees for its implementation of the Gopher protocol.\\r\\nIn September 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the European Commission. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made the Web available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The W3C decided that its standards must be based on royalty-free technology, so they can be easily adopted by anyone.\\r\\nBy 1996 it became obvious to most publicly traded companies that a public Web presence was no longer optional.[citation needed] Though at first people saw mainly[citation needed] the possibilities of free publishing and instant worldwide information, increasing familiarity with two-way communication over the \\"Web\\" led to the possibility of direct Web-based commerce (e-commerce) and instantaneous group communications worldwide. More dotcoms, displaying products on hypertext webpages, were added into the Web.\\r\\nLow interest rates in 1998ÿ99 facilitated an increase in start-up companies. Although a number of these new entrepreneurs had realistic plans and administrative ability, most of them lacked these characteristics but were able to sell their ideas to investors because of the novelty of the dot-com concept.\\r\\nHistorically, the dot-com boom can be seen as similar to a number of other technology-inspired booms of the past including railroads in the 1840s, automobiles in the early 20th century, radio in the 1920s, television in the 1940s, transistor electronics in the 1950s, computer time-sharing in the 1960s, and home computers and biotechnology in the 1980s.\\r\\nIn 2001 the bubble burst, and many dot-com startups went out of business after burning through their venture capital and failing to become profitable. Many others, however, did survive and thrive in the early 21st century. Many companies which began as online retailers blossomed and became highly profitable. More conventional retailers found online merchandising to be a profitable additional source of revenue. While some online entertainment and news outlets failed when their seed capital ran out, others persisted and eventually became economically self-sufficient. Traditional media outlets (newspaper publishers, broadcasters and cablecasters in particular) also found the Web to be a useful and profitable additional channel for content distribution, and an additional means to generate advertising revenue. The sites that survived and eventually prospered after the bubble burst had two things in common; a sound business plan, and a niche in the marketplace that was, if not unique, particularly well-defined and well-served.\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, telecommunications companies had a great deal of overcapacity as many Internet business clients went bust. That, plus ongoing investment in local cell infrastructure kept connectivity charges low, helped to make high-speed Internet connectivity more affordable. During this time, a handful of companies found success developing business models that helped make the World Wide Web a more compelling experience. These include airline booking sites, Google's search engine and its profitable approach to keyword-based advertising, as well as eBay's auction site and Amazon.com's online department store.\\r\\nThis new era also begot social networking websites, such as MySpace and Facebook, which gained acceptance rapidly and became a central part of youth culture.\\r\\nBeginning in 2002, new ideas for sharing and exchanging content ad hoc, such as Weblogs and RSS, rapidly gained acceptance on the Web. This new model for information exchange, primarily featuring user-generated and user-edited websites, was dubbed Web 2.0. The Web 2.0 boom saw many new service-oriented startups catering to a newly democratized Web.\\r\\nAs the Web became easier to query, it attained a greater ease of use overall and gained a sense of organization which ushered in a period of rapid popularization. Many new sites such as Wikipedia and its Wikimedia Foundation sister projects were based on the concept of user-edited content. In 2005, three former PayPal employees created a video viewing website called YouTube, which quickly became popular and introduced a new concept of user-submitted content in major events.\\r\\nThe popularity of YouTube, Facebook, etc., combined with the increasing availability and affordability of high-speed connections has made video content far more common on all kinds of websites. Many video-content hosting and creation sites provide an easy means for their videos to be embedded on third party websites without payment or permission.\\r\\nThis combination of more user-created or edited content, and easy means of sharing content, such as via RSS widgets and video embedding, has led to many sites with a typical \\"Web 2.0\\" feel. They have articles with embedded video, user-submitted comments below the article, and RSS boxes to the side, listing some of the latest articles from other sites.\\r\\nContinued extension of the Web has focused on connecting devices to the Internet, coined Intelligent Device Management. As Internet connectivity becomes ubiquitous, manufacturers have started to leverage the expanded computing power of their devices to enhance their usability and capability. Through Internet connectivity, manufacturers are now able to interact with the devices they have sold and shipped to their customers, and customers are able to interact with the manufacturer (and other providers) to access new content.\\r\\n\\"Web 2.0\\" has found a place in the English lexicon.[29]\\r\\nPopularized by Berners-Lee's book Weaving the Web[30] and a Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, James Hendler, and Ora Lassila,[31] the term Semantic Web describes an evolution of the existing Web in which the network of hyperlinked human-readable web pages is extended by machine-readable metadata about documents and how they are related to each other, enabling automated agents to access the Web more intelligently and perform tasks on behalf of users. This has yet to happen. In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that the idea \\"remains largely unrealized\\".[32]","field3":"When was the world wide web made public?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"a model used in chemistry to predict the geometry of individual molecules from the number of electron pairs surrounding their central atoms","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory is a model used in chemistry to predict the geometry of individual molecules from the number of electron pairs surrounding their central atoms.[1] It is also named the Gillespie-Nyholm theory after its two main developers, Ronald Gillespie and Ronald Nyholm. The acronym \\"VSEPR\\" is pronounced either \\"ves-pur\\"[2]:410 or \\"vuh-seh-per\\".[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe premise of VSEPR is that the valence electron pairs surrounding an atom tend to repel each other and will, therefore, adopt an arrangement that minimizes this repulsion, thus determining the molecule's geometry.  Gillespie has emphasized that the electron-electron repulsion due to the Pauli exclusion principle is more important in determining molecular geometry than the electrostatic repulsion.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nVSEPR theory is based on observable electron density rather than mathematical wave functions and hence unrelated to orbital hybridisation,[5] although both address molecular shape. While it is mainly qualitative, VSEPR has a quantitative basis in quantum chemical topology (QCT) methods such as the electron localization function and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of a correlation between molecular geometry and number of valence electron pairs (both shared and unshared pairs) was originally proposed in 1939 by Ryutaro Tsuchida in Japan,[6] and was independently presented in a Bakerian Lecture in 1940 by Nevil Sidgwick and Herbert Powell of the University of Oxford.[7] In 1957, Ronald Gillespie and Ronald Sydney Nyholm of University College London refined this concept into a more detailed theory, capable of choosing between various alternative geometries.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, VSEPR theory has been criticized as an outdated model from the standpoint of both scientific accuracy and pedagogical value.[10]  In particular, the equivalent lone pairs of water and carbonyl compounds in VSEPR theory neglect fundamental differences in the symmetries ( vs. ) of molecular orbitals and natural bond orbitals that correspond to them, a difference that is sometimes chemically significant.  Furthermore, there is little evidence, computational or experimental, proposing that lone pairs are \\"bigger\\" than bonding pairs.  It has been suggested that Bent's rule is capable of replacing VSEPR as a simple model for explaining molecular structure.  Nevertheless, VSEPR theory captures many of the essential features of the structure and electron distribution of simple molecules, and most undergraduate general chemistry courses continue to teach it.\\r\\n\\r\\nVSEPR theory is used to predict the arrangement of electron pairs around non-hydrogen atoms in molecules, especially simple and symmetric molecules, where these key, central atoms participate in bonding to two or more other atoms; the geometry of these key atoms and their non-bonding electron pairs in turn determine the geometry of the larger whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of electron pairs in the valence shell of a central atom is determined after drawing the Lewis structure of the molecule, and expanding it to show all bonding groups and lone pairs of electrons.[2]:410ÿ417 In VSEPR theory, a double bond or triple bond are treated as a single bonding group.[2] The sum of the number of atoms bonded to a central atom and the number of lone pairs formed by its nonbonding valence electrons is known as the central atom's steric number.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe electron pairs (or groups if multiple bonds are present) are assumed to lie on the surface of a sphere centered on the central atom and tend to occupy positions that minimize their mutual repulsions by maximizing the distance between them.[2]:410ÿ417[11] The number of electron pairs (or groups), therefore, determines the overall geometry that they will adopt. For example, when there are two electron pairs surrounding the central atom, their mutual repulsion is minimal when they lie at opposite poles of the sphere. Therefore, the central atom is predicted to adopt a linear geometry. If there are 3 electron pairs surrounding the central atom, their repulsion is minimized by placing them at the vertices of an equilateral triangle centered on the atom. Therefore, the predicted geometry is trigonal. Likewise, for 4 electron pairs, the optimal arrangement is tetrahedral.[2]:410ÿ417\\r\\n\\r\\nThe overall geometry is further refined by distinguishing between bonding and nonbonding electron pairs. The bonding electron pair shared in a sigma bond with an adjacent atom lies further from the central atom than a nonbonding (lone) pair of that atom, which is held close to its positively charged nucleus. VSEPR theory therefore views repulsion by the lone pair to be greater than the repulsion by a bonding pair. As such, when a molecule has 2 interactions with different degrees of repulsion, VSEPR theory predicts the structure where lone pairs occupy positions that allow them to experience less repulsion. Lone pairÿlone pair (lpÿlp) repulsions are considered stronger than lone pairÿbonding pair (lpÿbp) repulsions, which in turn are considered stronger than bonding pairÿbonding pair (bpÿbp) repulsions, distinctions that then guide decisions about overall geometry when 2 or more non-equivalent positions are possible.[2]:410ÿ417 For instance, when 5 valence electron pairs surround a central atom, they adopt a trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry with two collinear axial positions and three equatorial positions. An electron pair in an axial position has three close equatorial neighbors only 90 away and a fourth much farther at 180, while an equatorial electron pair has only two adjacent pairs at 90 and two at 120. The repulsion from the close neighbors at 90 is more important, so that the axial positions experience more repulsion than the equatorial positions; hence, when there are lone pairs, they tend to occupy equatorial positions as shown in the diagrams of the next section for steric number five.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difference between lone pairs and bonding pairs may also be used to rationalize deviations from idealized geometries. For example, the H2O molecule has four electron pairs in its valence shell: two lone pairs and two bond pairs.  The four electron pairs are spread so as to point roughly towards the apices of a tetrahedron.  However, the bond angle between the two OÿH bonds is only 104.5, rather than the 109.5 of a regular tetrahedron, because the two lone pairs (whose density or probability envelopes lie closer to the oxygen nucleus) exert a greater mutual repulsion than the two bond pairs.[2]:410ÿ417[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn advanced-level explanation replaces the above distinction with two rules:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"AXE method\\" of electron counting is commonly used when applying the VSEPR theory. The A represents the central atom and always has an implied subscript one.  The X represents each of ligands (atoms bonded to A). The E represents the number of lone electron pairs surrounding the central atom.[2]:410ÿ417 The sum of X and E is known as the steric number.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the steric number and distribution of Xs and Es, VSEPR theory makes the predictions in the following tables. Note that the geometries are named according to the atomic positions only and not the electron arrangement. For example, the description of AX2E1 as a bent molecule means that the three atoms AX2 are not in one straight line, although the lone pair helps to determine the geometry.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the substituent (X) atoms are not all the same, the geometry is still approximately valid, but the bond angles may be slightly different from the ones where all the outside atoms are the same.  For example, the double-bond carbons in alkenes like C2H4 are AX3E0, but the bond angles are not all exactly 120.  Likewise, SOCl2 is AX3E1, but because the X substituents are not identical, the XÿAÿX angles are not all equal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a tool in predicting the geometry adopted with a given number of electron pairs, an often used physical demonstration of the principle of minimal electron pair repulsion utilizes inflated balloons. Through handling, balloons acquire a slight surface electrostatic charge that results in the adoption of roughly the same geometries when they are tied together at their stems as the corresponding number of electron pairs.  For example, five balloons tied together adopt the trigonal bipyramidal geometry, just as do the five bonding pairs of a PCl5 molecule (AX5) or the two bonding and three non-bonding pairs of a XeF2 molecule (AX2E3).  The molecular geometry of the former is also trigonal bipyramidal, whereas that of the latter is linear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe methane molecule (CH4) is tetrahedral because there are four pairs of electrons. The four hydrogen atoms are positioned at the vertices of a tetrahedron, and the bond angle is cos?1(??1?3)??109?28.[16][17] This is referred to as an AX4 type of molecule. As mentioned above, A represents the central atom and X represents an outer atom.[2]:410ÿ417\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ammonia molecule (NH3) has three pairs of electrons involved in bonding, but there is a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom.[2]:392ÿ393 It is not bonded with another atom; however, it influences the overall shape through repulsions. As in methane above, there are four regions of electron density. Therefore, the overall orientation of the regions of electron density is tetrahedral. On the other hand, there are only three outer atoms. This is referred to as an AX3E type molecule because the lone pair is represented by an E.[2]:410ÿ417 By definition, the molecular shape or geometry describes the geometric arrangement of the atomic nuclei only, which is trigonal-pyramidal for NH3.[2]:410ÿ417\\r\\n\\r\\nSteric numbers of 7 or greater are possible, but are less common. The steric number of 7 occurs in iodine heptafluoride (IF7); the base geometry for a steric number of 7 is pentagonal bipyramidal.[11] The most common geometry for a steric number of 8 is a square antiprismatic geometry.[15]:1165 Examples of this include the octacyanomolybdate (Mo(CN)4?8) and octafluorozirconate (ZrF4?8) anions.[15]:1165\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nonahydridorhenate ion (ReH2?9) in potassium nonahydridorhenate is a rare example of a compound with a steric number of 9, which has a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry.[14]:254[15] Another example is the octafluoroxenate ion (XeF2?8) in nitrosonium octafluoroxenate(VI),[14]:498[18][19] although in this case one of the electron pairs is a lone pair, and therefore the molecule actually has a distorted square antiprismatic geometry.\\r\\n\\r\\nPossible geometries for steric numbers of 10, 11, 12, or 14 are bicapped square antiprismatic (or bicapped dodecadeltahedral), octadecahedral, icosahedral, and bicapped hexagonal antiprismatic, respectively. No compounds with steric numbers this high involving monodentate ligands exist, and those involving multidentate ligands can often be analysed more simply as complexes with lower steric numbers when some multidentate ligands are treated as a unit.[15]:1165,1721\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are groups of compounds where VSEPR fails to predict the correct geometry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gas phase structures of the triatomic halides of the heavier members of group 2, (i.e., calcium, strontium and barium halides, MX2), are not linear as predicted but are bent, (approximate XÿMÿX angles: CaF2, 145; SrF2, 120; BaF2, 108; SrCl2, 130; BaCl2, 115; BaBr2, 115; BaI2, 105).[20] It has been proposed by Gillespie that this is caused by interaction of the ligands with the electron core of the metal atom, polarising it so that the inner shell is not spherically symmetric, thus influencing the molecular geometry.[21][22] Ab initio calculations have been cited to propose that contributions from d orbitals in the shell below the valence shell are responsible.[23] Disilynes are also bent, despite having no lone pairs.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne example of the AX2E2 geometry is molecular lithium oxide, Li2O, a linear rather than bent structure, which is ascribed to its bonds being essentially ionic and the strong lithium-lithium repulsion that results.[25] Another example is O(SiH3)2 with an SiÿOÿSi angle of 144.1, which compares to the angles in Cl2O (110.9), (CH3)2O (111.7), and N(CH3)3 (110.9).[21] Gillespie and Robinson rationalize the SiÿOÿSi bond angle based on the observed ability of a ligand's lone pair to most greatly repel other electron pairs when the ligand electronegativity is greater than or equal to that of the central atom.[21] In O(SiH3)2, the central atom is more electronegative, and the lone pairs are less localized and more weakly repulsive.  The larger SiÿOÿSi bond angle results from this and strong ligand-ligand repulsion by the relatively large -SiH3 ligand.[21]  Burford et al showed through X-ray diffraction studies that Cl3AlÿOÿPCl3 has a linear AlÿOÿP bond angle and is therefore a non-VSEPR molecule.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome AX6E1 molecules, e.g. xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) and the Te(IV) and Bi(III) anions, TeCl2?6, TeBr2?6, BiCl3?6, BiBr3?6 and BiI3?6, are octahedra, rather than pentagonal pyramids, and the lone pair does not affect the geometry to the degree predicted by VSEPR.[26] One rationalization is that steric crowding of the ligands allows little or no room for the non-bonding lone pair;[21] another rationalization is the inert pair effect.[14]:214\\r\\n\\r\\nMany transition metal compounds have unusual geometries, which can be ascribed to ligand bonding interaction with the d subshell and to absence of valence shell lone pairs.[27] Gillespie suggested that this interaction can be weak or strong. Weak interaction is dealt with by the Kepert model, while strong interaction produces bonding pairs that also occupy the respective antipodal points of the sphere.[4] This is similar to predictions based on sd hybrid orbitals[28][29] using the VALBOND theory. The repulsion of these bidirectional bonding pairs leads to a different prediction of shapes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kepert model cannot explain the formation of square planar complexes or distorted structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe VSEPR theory can be extended to molecules with an odd number of electrons by treating the unpaired electron as a \\"half electron pair\\"  for example, Gillespie and Nyholm[8]:364ÿ365 suggested that the decrease in the bond angle in the series NO+2 (180), NO2 (134), NO?2 (115) indicates that a given set of bonding electron pairs exert a weaker repulsion on a single non-bonding electron than on a pair of non-bonding electrons. In effect, they considered nitrogen dioxide as an AX2E0.5 molecule, with a geometry intermediate between NO+2 and NO?2. Similarly, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is an AX2E1.5 molecule, with a geometry intermediate between ClO+2 and ClO?2.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the methyl radical (CH3) is predicted to be trigonal pyramidal like the methyl anion (CH?3), but with a larger bond angle (as in the trigonal planar methyl cation (CH+3)). However, in this case, the VSEPR prediction is not quite true, as CH3 is actually planar, although its distortion to a pyramidal geometry requires very little energy.[32]","field3":"What is the valence shell electron pair repulsion theory?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"7 October 2001","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"","field3":"When did the us first send troops to afghanistan?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Elizabeth II","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The following is a list, ordered by length of reign, of the monarchs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1927ÿpresent), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801ÿ1927), the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707ÿ1801), the Kingdom of England (871ÿ1707), the Kingdom of Scotland (878ÿ1707), the Kingdom of Ireland (1542ÿ1800), and the Principality of Wales (1216ÿ1542).\\r\\nQueen Elizabeth II became the longest-reigning British monarch on 9 September 2015 when she surpassed the reign of her great-great-grandmother Victoria.[1][2] On 6 February 2017 she became the first British monarch to celebrate a sapphire jubilee, commemorating 65 years on the throne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the ten longest reigning monarchs in Britain for whom there is reliable recorded evidence.\\r\\nThe longest claim by a pretender was that of James Francis Edward Stuart (the \\"Old Pretender\\"), who was the Jacobite pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland for 64 years, 3 months, and 16 days (17 September 1701 ÿ 1 January 1766).\\r\\n1 - Elizabeth II\\r\\n2 - Victoria\\r\\n3 - George III\\r\\n4 - James VI and I\\r\\n5 - Henry III\\r\\n6 - Edward III\\r\\n7 - William I\\r\\n8 - Llywelyn I\\r\\n9 - Elizabeth I\\r\\n10 - David II\\r\\nOn 9 September 2015 (at the age of 7004326480000000000?89?years, 141?days), Elizabeth II became the longest-reigning British monarch and the longest-reigning female monarch in world history.[3][4] On 23 May 2016 (at the age of 7004329050000000000?90?years, 32?days), her reign surpassed the claimed reign of James Francis Edward Stuart (the \\"Old Pretender\\").[5] On 13 October 2016 (at the age of 7004330480000000000?90?years, 175?days), she became the world's longest-reigning current monarch (and the world's longest-serving current head of state) after the death of Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), King of Thailand.[6][7]\\r\\nShould she still be reigning on?ÿ\\r\\nOn 1 January 1801 the Kingdom of Great Britain united with the Kingdom of Ireland to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, becoming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by Act of Parliament in 1927[11] following the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922.\\r\\nOn 1 May 1707, under the Acts of Union 1707, the Kingdom of England united with the Kingdom of Scotland as the Kingdom of Great Britain.\\r\\nIncludes English monarchs from the installation of Alfred the Great as King of Wessex in 871 to Anne (House of Stuart) and the Acts of Union on 1 May 1707, when the crown became part of the Kingdom of Great Britain.\\r\\nIncludes Scottish monarchs from the installation of Kenneth I (House of Alpin) in 848 to Anne (House of Stuart) and the Acts of Union on 1 May 1707, when the crown became part of the Kingdom of Great Britain.\\r\\nThe High King of Ireland (846ÿ1198) was primarily a titular title (with the exception of Ruaidr Ua Conchobair who was regarded as the first \\"King of Ireland\\").

It serves as the central point for the study of the history of baseball in the United States and beyond, displays baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, and honors those who have excelled in playing, managing, and serving the sport. The Hall's motto is \\"Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations.\\"\\r\\nThe word Cooperstown is often used as shorthand (or a metonym) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.\\r\\nThe Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by Stephen Carlton Clark, the owner of a local hotel. Clark had sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the Great Depression, which reduced the local tourist trade, and Prohibition, which devastated the local hops industry. A new building was constructed, and the Hall of Fame was dedicated on June 12, 1939. (Clark's granddaughter, Jane Forbes Clark, is the current chairman of the Board of Directors.)\\r\\nThe erroneous claim that Civil War hero Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall.\\r\\nAn expanded library and research facility opened in 1994.[2] Dale Petroskey became the organization's president in 1999.[3]\\r\\nIn 2002, the Hall launched Baseball As America, a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years. The Hall of Fame has since also sponsored educational programming on the Internet to bring the Hall of Fame to schoolchildren who might not visit. The Hall and Museum completed a series of renovations in spring 2005. The Hall of Fame also presents an annual exhibit at FanFest at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\\r\\nJeff Idelson replaced Petroskey as president on April 16, 2008.[4] He had been acting as president since March 25, 2008, when Petroskey was forced to resign for having \\"failed to exercise proper fiduciary responsibility\\" and making \\"judgments that were not in the best interest of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong baseball fans, \\"Hall of Fame\\" means not only the museum and facility in Cooperstown, New York, but the pantheon of players, managers, umpires, executives, and pioneers who have been enshrined in the Hall.

Of the 35 Negro league members, 29 were inducted posthumously, including all 24 selected since the 1990s.

Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election).[9] From a final ballot typically including 25ÿ40 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75% or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5% of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee.[10] Players receiving 5% or more of the votes but fewer than 75% are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility (lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election).[11]\\r\\nUnder special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. Addie Joss was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. Roberto Clemente's induction in 1973 set the precedent when the writers chose to put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972.\\r\\n Ogden Nash, Sport magazine (January 1949)[12]\\r\\nThe five-year waiting period was established in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; Joe DiMaggio received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement.\\r\\nContrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for Lou Gehrig (other than to hold a special one-man election for him): there was no waiting period at that time, and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season. However, the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was terminally ill, making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.\\r\\nIf a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 10 years of his retirement from active play, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following changes to the election process for that body made in 2010 and 2016, it is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballotboth long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives). From 2011 through 2016, each candidate could be considered once every three years;[13] now, the frequency depends on the era in which an individual made his greatest contributions.[14] A more complete discussion of the new process is available below.\\r\\nFrom 2008 to 2010, following changes made by the Hall in July 2007, the main Veterans Committee, then made up of living Hall of Famers, voted only on players whose careers began in 1943 or later. These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:\\r\\nPlayers of the Negro Leagues have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005 the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro Leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro Leagues figures were primarily considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871ÿ1946 era, called the \\"Pre-Integration Era\\" by the Hall; since 2016, Negro Leagues figures are primarily considered alongside other figures from what the Hall calls the \\"Early Baseball\\" era (1871ÿ1949).\\r\\nPredictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions as to whether they deserved election. For example, Bill James' book Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame? goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.\\r\\nThe actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.[16][17][18][19][20]\\r\\nIn 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees.[21] The revamped Committee held three elections, in 2003 and 2007, for both players and non-players, and in 2005 for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members, most of whom were Hall members, were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt noted, \\"The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors.\\"[10] In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.\\r\\nIn the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the 2008 election process. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the 2009 election process; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for preÿWorld War II players elected Joe Gordon in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-World War II panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.\\r\\nFurther changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall on July 26, 2010, effective with the 2011 election.[13]\\r\\nAll individuals eligible for induction but not eligible for BBWAA consideration were considered on a single ballot, grouped by the following eras in which they made their greatest contributions:\\r\\nThe Hall used the BBWAA's Historical Overview Committee to formulate the ballots for each era, consisting of 12 individuals for the Expansion Era and 10 for the other eras. The Hall's board of directors selected a committee of 16 voters for each era, made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each committee met and voted at the Baseball Winter Meetings once every three years. The Expansion Era committee held its first vote in 2010 for 2011 induction, with longtime general manager Pat Gillick becoming the first individual elected under the new procedure. The Golden Era committee voted in 2011 for the induction class of 2012, with Ron Santo becoming the first player elected under the new procedure. The Pre-Integration Era committee voted in 2012 for the induction class of 2013, electing three figures. Subsequent elections rotated among the three committees in that order through the 2016 election.\\r\\nIn July 2016, however, the Hall of Fame announced a restructuring of the timeframes to be considered, with a much greater emphasis on modern eras. Four new committees were established:\\r\\nAll committees' ballots now include 10 candidates. While there was previously a one-year waiting period after elimination from annual BBWAA consideration, there is now no waiting period. At least one committee convenes each December as part of the election process for the following calendar year's induction ceremony. The Early Baseball committee convenes only in years ending in 0 (2020, 2030). The Golden Days committee convenes only in years ending in 0 and 5 (2020, 2025). The remaining two committees convene twice every 5 years. More specifically, the Today's Game and Modern Baseball committees alternate their meetings in that order, skipping years in which either the Early Baseball or Golden Days committee meets. This means that in the next two 5-year cycles, the Today's Game committee (having met in 2016) will meet in 2018, 2021, and 2023, while the Modern Baseball committee (which met in 2017) will meet in 2019, 2022 and 2024. Additionally, the Hall of Fame has modified the criteria under which active executives can be considered for induction. All active executives age 70 or older may now have their careers reviewed as part of the Era Committee balloting process, regardless of the position they hold in an organization, and regardless of whether their body of work has been completed. Previously, active executives 65 years or older were eligible for consideration.[14]\\r\\nWhile the text on a player's or manager's plaque lists all teams for which the inductee was a member in that specific role, inductees are usually depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, though in a few cases, like umpires, they wear caps without logos. (Executives are not depicted wearing caps.) Additionally, as of 2015, inductee biographies on the Hall's website for all players and managers, and executives who were associated with specific teams, list a \\"primary team\\", which does not necessarily match the cap logo. The Hall selects the logo \\"based on where that player makes his most indelible mark.\\"[22]\\r\\nAlthough the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players or managers whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of inductees associated with multiple teams are the following:\\r\\nIn all of the above cases, the \\"primary team\\" is the team for which the inductee spent the largest portion of his career except for Ryan, whose primary team is listed as the Angels despite playing one fewer season for that team than for the Astros.\\r\\nIn 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though Wade Boggs denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.)[23] The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player's wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:\\r\\nAccording to the Hall of Fame, approximately 300,000 visitors enter the museum each year,[1] and the running total has surpassed 14 million.[citation needed] These visitors see only a fraction of its 40,000 artifacts, 3 million library items (such as newspaper clippings and photos) and 140,000 baseball cards.[1]\\r\\nThe Hall has seen a noticeable decrease in attendance in recent years. A 2013 story on ESPN.com about the village of Cooperstown and its relation to the game partially linked the reduced attendance with Cooperstown Dreams Park, a youth baseball complex about 5 miles (8.0?km) away in the town of Hartwick. The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere. According to the story,[30]\\r\\nPrior to Dreams Park, a room might be filled for a week by several sets of tourists. Now, that room will be taken by just one family for the week, and that family may only go into Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame once. While there are other contributing factors (the recession and high gas prices among them), the Hall's attendance has tumbled since Dreams Park opened. The Hall drew 383,000 visitors in 1999. It drew 262,000 last year.\\r\\nA controversy erupted in 1982, when it emerged that some historic items given to the Hall had been sold on the collectibles market. The items had been lent to the Baseball Commissioner's office, gotten mixed up with other property owned by the Commissioner's office and employees of the office, and moved to the garage of Joe Reichler, an assistant to Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who sold the items to resolve his personal financial difficulties. Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner's Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame's reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.[34]\\r\\nFollowing the banning of Pete Rose from MLB, the selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's permanent suspension list, such as Rose or Shoeless Joe Jackson. Many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose.\\r\\nJackson and Rose were both banned from MLB for life for actions related to gambling on their own teamsJackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to lose the 1919 World Series intentionally, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the Cincinnati Reds when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his 2004 autobiography. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer Bill James, though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to \\"those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer\\".[35]\\r\\nIn 2012, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed a law ordering the United States Mint to produce and sell commemorative, non-circulating coins to benefit the private, non-profit Hall.[36][37] The bill, H.R. 2527, was introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Rep. Richard Hanna, a Republican from New York, and passed the House on October 26, 2011.[38] The coins, which depict baseball gloves and balls, are the first concave designs produced by the Mint. The mintage included 50,000 gold coins, 400,000 silver coins, and 750,000 clad (Nickel-Copper) coins. The Mint released them on March 27, 2014, and the gold and silver editions quickly sold out. The Hall receives money from surcharges included in the sale price: a total of $9.5 million if all the coins are sold.[39]\\r\\nNotes","field3":"Where is the national baseball hall of fame?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"64 teams","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The College World Series (CWS) is an annual June baseball tournament held in Omaha, Nebraska.

The business within 60 years had blended the first dessert sherry dubbed 'cream' which has changed little since 1880 and is known as Harveys Bristol Cream. The brand was sold to Beam Global in 2010 and to Grupo Emperador Spain S.A. in 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1796 the first iteration of Harvey's wine-trading business was established in Denmark Street in Bristol. This was owned by William Perry, who went into partnership with Thomas Urch.[1] In 1822 Urch's nephew (John Harvey I) joined the firm as an apprentice. By 1839 John Harvey was senior partner in the Bristol branch of the family business and by 1871 the whole business was known as John Harvey & Sons.[1]\\r\\nBristol Cream sherry exports to America boomed from 1928 onwards with Jack Harvey making trips there as often as he could.[1] From 1962 the business was known as Harveys of Bristol Ltd, and in 1966 the firm including all subsidiaries was bought out by Showerings, Vine Products & Whiteways Ltd.[1] After 1960 the business relocated from Denmark Street to Whitchurch Lane, Hartcliffe, at which point the Denmark Street cellars became Britain's only wine museum, with adjoining restaurant. Both closed in 2003.[1] By 2016, the bar Harveys Cellars was located on the same site in Denmark Street.[2]\\r\\nBristol Cream is a dark, complex amber[n 1][3] product of Spanish fortified wine (sherry) that has been blended and bottled in Bristol, England since 1796. It was wholly owned by John Harvey & Sons of Bristol until the 21st century acquisition. Since the 1970s, Harvey's has sold the products in bottles made from Bristol blue glass. John Harvey's descendants have continued importing and making Bristol cream since the takeover of the company's main brand. Some residual assets or shares of the business such as in vineyards are owned by former board member Joseph Harvey, the youngest of John Harvey's male descendants.\\r\\nThe bottle label's serving suggestion from the latter part of the 20th century onward is to mix if so wished with two parts lemonade (optional extras are also mentioned). The deep amber product is sweet, rich and with a slightly spicy aroma. Harveys Bristol Cream is often enjoyed on its own, chilled or not chilled.\\r\\nThe business specialises in importing, blending and exporting the fortified wine, sherry. It originally sold a wider mix of Spanish and Portuguese wines and from the early 19th century specialised in fortified wines which travelled better consistently. During the 1860s and 1880s in the company's cellars, John Harvey[n 2] and his brother Edward Harvey developed what was dubbed a new type of sherry: cream sherry (in flavour and texture). This became the main product: Harveys Bristol Cream. The blend starts with wines from fifty different soleras, including three sherry types: Fino, Amontillado, and Oloroso. Finally some Pedro Ximnez wine from sun-dried 'raisonified' grapes of the region is blended for sweetness, for the richness or 'creaminess' of aftertaste that is the hallmark of the product.\\r\\nSince its inception it has been generally reviewed as one of the major four types of sherry, although less so in some parts of Spain.[4][3] The business eventually began buying its own vineyards to invest in fermenting and fortification premises locally and to protect the quality of source material.[5] The business uses its estate vineyards in Jerez Superior and uses all of its Palomino grapes as the main source grape.[6]\\r\\nThis product has been bottled in Bristol blue glass since the 1970s,[7] and the brand was sold to Beam Global in 2010[8] and to Grupo Emperador Spain S.A. in 2015.[9]\\r\\nThe records of John Harveys & Sons are held by Bristol Archives (Ref. 40913) (online catalogue).","field3":"Where is harvey's bristol cream sherry made?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Phillis Wheatley","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Phillis Wheatley, also spelled Phyllis and Wheatly (c. 1753 ÿ December 5, 1784) was the first published African-American female poet.[1][2] Born in West Africa, she was sold into slavery at the age of seven or eight and transported to North America. She was purchased by the Wheatley family of Boston, who taught her to read and write and encouraged her poetry when they saw her talent.\\r\\nThe publication of her Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral (1773) brought her fame both in England and the American colonies. Figures such as George Washington praised her work.[3] During Wheatley's visit to England with her master's son, African-American poet Jupiter Hammon praised her work in his own poem. Wheatley was emancipated (set free) shortly after the publication of her book.[4] She married in about 1778. Two of her children died as infants. After her husband was imprisoned for debt in 1784, Wheatley fell into poverty and died of illness, quickly followed by the death of her surviving infant son.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the date and place of her birth are not documented, scholars believe that Phillis Wheatley was born in 1753 in West Africa, most likely in present-day Gambia or Senegal.[6] Wheatley was sold by a local chief to a visiting trader, who took her to Boston in the British colony of Massachusetts, on July 11, 1761,[7] on a ship called The Phillis.[8] It was owned by Timothy Fitch and captained by Peter Gwinn.[8]\\r\\nOn arrival she was re-sold to the wealthy Boston merchant and tailor John Wheatley, who bought the young girl as a servant for his wife Susanna. John and Susanna Wheatley named the young girl Phillis, after the ship that had brought her to America. She was given their last name of Wheatley, as was a common custom if any surname was used for slaves.\\r\\nThe Wheatleys' 18-year-old daughter, Mary, first tutored Phillis in reading and writing. Their son Nathaniel also helped her. John Wheatley was known as a progressive throughout New England; his family gave Phillis an unprecedented education for an enslaved person, and for a female of any race. By the age of 12, Phillis was reading Greek and Latin classics and difficult passages from the Bible. At the age of 14, she wrote her first poem, \\"To the University of Cambridge, in New England.\\"[9][10] Recognizing her literary ability, the Wheatley family supported Phillis's education and left the household labor to their other domestic slaves. The Wheatleys often showed off her abilities to friends and family. Strongly influenced by her studies of the works of Alexander Pope, John Milton, Homer, Horace and Virgil, Phillis Wheatley began to write poetry.[11]\\r\\nIn 1773, at the age of 20, Phillis accompanied Nathaniel Wheatley to London in part for her health, but also because Susanna believed she would have a better chance publishing her book of poems there.[12] She had an audience with the Lord Mayor of London (an audience with George III was arranged, but Phillis returned home beforehand), as well as with other significant members of British society. Unfortunately, she was never able to personally meet Selina Hastings, the Countess of Huntingdon, who served as the patron of Wheatley's volume of poems, which was published in the summer of 1773.[13] In 1774, Phillis Wheatley wrote a letter to Reverend Samson Occom, commending him on his ideas and beliefs of how the slaves should be given their natural born rights in America. Wheatley also exchanged letters with the British philanthropist John Thornton, who in turn discussed Wheatley and her poetry in his correspondence with John Newton.[14] Along with her poetry, she was able to express her thoughts, comments and concerns to others.[15] In 1775, Phillis Wheatley sent a copy of a poem entitled, To His Excellency, George Washington to him. In 1776, Washington invited Wheatley to visit him at his headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which she did in March 1776.[16] Thomas Paine republished the poem in the Pennsylvania Gazette in April 1776.[17]\\r\\nIn 1773, sometime between July and October, Wheatley was emancipated by the Wheatley family shortly after her book, Poems on Subjects Religious and Moral, was published in London. Susanna Wheatley died in the spring of 1774. John Wheatley's death followed in 1778. Shortly after, Phillis Wheatley met and married John Peters, a free black grocer. They struggled with poor living conditions and the deaths of two babies.[18]\\r\\nIn 1779, Wheatley submitted a proposal for a second volume of poems, but was unable to publish it because of her financial circumstances, the loss of patrons after her emancipation (often publication of books was based on gaining subscriptions for guaranteed sales beforehand), and the Revolutionary War. However, some of her poems that were to be published in that volume were later published in pamphlets and newspapers.[19]\\r\\nHer husband John Peters was improvident, and imprisoned for debt in 1784, leaving an impoverished Wheatley with a sickly infant son. She went to work as a scullery maid at a boarding house to support them, a kind of domestic labor that she had not been accustomed to, even before becoming a free person. Wheatley died on December 5, 1784, at the age of 31.[20]\\r\\nIn 1768, Wheatley wrote \\"To the King's Most Excellent Majesty,\\" in which she praised King George III for repealing the Stamp Act.[4] As the American Revolution gained strength, Wheatley's writing turned to themes that expressed ideas of the rebellious colonists.\\r\\nIn 1770 Wheatley wrote a poetic tribute to the evangelist George Whitefield, which received widespread acclaim. Her poetry expressed Christian themes, and many poems were dedicated to famous figures. Over one-third consist of elegies, the remainder being on religious, classical, and abstract themes.[22] She seldom referred to her own life in her poems. One example of a poem on slavery is \\"On being brought from Africa to America\\":[23]\\r\\nHistorians have commented on her reluctance to write about slavery. Perhaps it was because she had conflicting feelings about the institution. In the poem above, critics have said that she praises slavery because it brought her to Christianity. But, in another poem, she wrote that slavery was a cruel fate.[24]\\r\\nMany colonists found it difficult to believe that an African slave was writing \\"excellent\\" poetry. Wheatley had to defend her authorship of her poetry in court in 1772.[25][26] She was examined by a group of Boston luminaries, including John Erving, Reverend Charles Chauncey, John Hancock, Thomas Hutchinson, the governor of Massachusetts, and his lieutenant governor Andrew Oliver. They concluded she had written the poems ascribed to her and signed an attestation, which was included in the preface of her book of collected works: Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, published in London in 1773. Publishers in Boston had declined to publish it, but her work was of great interest in London. There, Selina, Countess of Huntingdon and the Earl of Dartmouth acted as patrons to help Wheatley gain publication.\\r\\nIn 1778, the African-American poet Jupiter Hammon wrote an ode to Wheatley (An Address to Miss Phillis Wheatley). Hammon wrote this poem while Hammon's owner, Lloyd, had temporarily moved himself and the slaves he owned to Hartford, Connecticut, during the Revolutionary War. Hammon saw Wheatley as having succumbed to what he believed were pagan influences in her writing, and so the Address consisted of twenty-one rhyming quatrains, each accompanied by a related Bible verse, that he thought would compel Wheatley to return to a Christian path in life.[27]\\r\\nBoston-based publisher and abolitionist Isaac Knapp collected Wheatley's poetry along with that of enslaved North Carolina poet George Moses Horton in 1838 under the title Memoir and Poems of Phillis Wheatley, A Native African and a Slave. Also, Poems by a Slave.[28] The memoir was earlier published in 1834 by Geo W. Light, but did not include poems by Horton.\\r\\nWheatley believed that the power of poetry is immeasurable.[29] John C. Shields notes that her poetry did not simply reflect the literature that she read but was based on her personal ideas and beliefs. Shields writes, \\"Wheatley had more in mind than simple conformity. It will be shown later that her allusions to the sun god and to the goddess of the morn, always appearing as they do here in close association with her quest for poetic inspiration, are of central importance to her.\\" This poem is arranged into three stanzas of four lines in iambic tetrameter followed by a concluding couplet in iambic pentameter. The rhyme scheme is ababcc.[29][30]\\r\\nShe used three primary elements: Christianity, classicism, and hierophantic solar worship.[31] The hierophantic solar worship is what she brought with her from Africa; the worship of sun gods is expressed as part of her African culture. As her parents were sun worshipers, it may be why she used so many different words for the sun. For instance, she uses Aurora eight times, \\"Apollo seven, Phoebus twelve, and Sol twice.\\"[31] Shields believes that the word \\"light\\" is significant to her as it marks her African history, a past that she has left physically behind.[31]\\r\\nHe notes that Sun is a homonym for Son, and that Wheatley intended a double reference to Christ.[31] Wheatley also refers to \\"heav'nly muse\\" in two of her poems: \\"To a Clergy Man on the Death of his Lady\\" and \\"Isaiah LXIII,\\" signifying her idea of the Christian deity.[32]\\r\\nShields believes that her use of classicism set her work apart from that of her contemporaries. He writes, \\"Wheatleys use of classicism distinguishes her work as original and unique and deserves extended treatment.\\"[33] Shields sums up Wheatleys writing by characterizing it as \\"contemplative and reflective rather than brilliant and shimmering.\\"[30]\\r\\nWith the 1773 publication of Wheatley's book Poems on Various Subjects, she \\"became the most famous African on the face of the earth.\\"[34] Voltaire stated in a letter to a friend that Wheatley had proved that black people could write poetry. John Paul Jones asked a fellow officer to deliver some of his personal writings to \\"Phillis the African favorite of the Nine (muses) and Apollo.\\"[34] She was honored by many of America's founding fathers, including George Washington, who told her that \\"the style and manner [of your poetry] exhibit a striking proof of your great poetical Talents.\\"[35]\\r\\nCritics consider her work fundamental to the genre of African-American literature.[1] She is honored as the first African-American woman to publish a book and the first to make a living from her writing.[36]\\r\\nShe is commemorated on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.[40] The Phyllis Wheatley YWCA in Washington, D.C. and the Phyllis Wheatly High School in Houston, Texas are named for her.","field3":"Who was the first african american female writer?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"the euro","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The Dutch guilder (Dutch: gulden, IPA:?[???ld?(n)]) or fl. was the currency of the Netherlands from the 17th century until 2002, when it was replaced by the euro. Between 1999 and 2002, the guilder was officially a \\"national subunit\\" of the euro. However, physical payments could only be made in guilder, as no euro coins or banknotes were available. The Netherlands Antillean guilder is still in use in Cura?ao and Saint Maarten (two countries in the Kingdom of the Netherlands), but this currency is distinct from the Dutch guilder. In 2004, the Surinamese guilder was replaced by the Surinamese dollar.\\r\\nThe Dutch name gulden was a Middle Dutch adjective meaning \\"golden\\",[1] and the name indicates the coin was originally made of gold. The symbol ? or fl. for the Dutch guilder was derived from another old currency, the florin.\\r\\nThe exact exchange rate, still relevant for old contracts and for exchange of the old currency for euros at the central bank, is 2.20371 Dutch guilders (NLG) for 1 euro (EUR).[2] Inverted, this gives EUR 0.453780 for NLG 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the introduction of the first guilder, there were regional and foreign golden coins that were likely referred to as \\"gulden\\" in Dutch. The first internationally accepted Dutch coin called gulden dates from 1517:[3] the Carolusgulden (not to be confused with the English Carolus). Even before that, the County of Holland had minted golden coins since 1378.[4]\\r\\nAn early guilder, a 10.61-gram .910 silver coin, was minted by the States of Holland and West Friesland in 1680.[5] The original guilder design featured Pallas Athena standing,[citation needed] holding a spear topped by a hat in her right hand, resting with her left forearm on Gospels set on an ornate basis, with a small shield in the legend. This guilder was divided into 20 stuivers, each of 8 duiten or 16 penningen. The guilder gradually replaced other silver coin denominations circulating in the United Netherlands: the florijn (28 stuivers), the daalder (?1?1?2 guilders or 30 stuivers), the rijksdaalder (?2?1?2 guilders or 50 stuivers), the silver ducat (same value as the rijksdaalder) and the silver rider ducaton (3 guilders or 60 stuivers).\\r\\nBetween 1810 and 1814, the Netherlands was annexed to France and the French franc circulated. After the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdom of the Netherlands readopted the guilder. In 1817 it became decimalised, with one guilder equal to 100 cents. However, it was not until 1848 that the last pre-decimal coins (many of which dated back to the 17th century) were withdrawn from circulation, whilst some of the new, decimal coins continued to bear nicknames based on their values in the older currency system through to the 21st century. Until 1948, the plural of cent used on coins was centen, after that it was cent.\\r\\nThe Netherlands was initially on a bimetallic standard, with the guilder equal to 605.61 milligrams of fine gold or 9.615?grams of fine silver. In 1840, the silver standard was adjusted to 9.45?grams, with the gold standard suspended in 1848. In 1875, the Netherlands adopted a gold standard with 1 guilder equal to 604.8 milligrams of fine gold. The gold standard was suspended between 1914 and 1925 and was abandoned in 1936.[6]\\r\\nIn 1914 the guilder was traded at a rate of 2.46 guilders = 1 U.S. dollar. As of 1938, the rate was 1.82 guilders = 1 U.S. dollar. [7] One Dutch guilder in 1914 could buy roughly the same amount of goods and services as 10.02 U.S. dollars or 8.17 Euros in December 2017. In 1938, the guilder purchasing power would be approximately equal to 9.54 U.S. dollars or 7.78 Euros in December 2017. Overall, the guilder remained a very stable currency and was also the third highest-valued currency unit in Europe in the interwar period (after the British Pound Sterling and the Irish pound, which, at this time, were pegged to each other at par).\\r\\nFollowing the German occupation, on 10 May 1940, the guilder was pegged to the Reichsmark at a rate of 1 guilder = 1.5 Reichsmark. This rate was reduced to 1.327 on 17 July of the same year. The liberating Allied forces set an exchange rate of 2.652 guilders = 1 U.S. dollar, which became the peg for the guilder within the Bretton Woods system. In 1949, the peg was changed to 3.8 guilders = 1 dollar, approximately matching the devaluation of the British pound. In 1961, the guilder was revalued to 3.62 guilders = 1 dollar, a change approximately in line with that of the German mark. After 1967 guilders were made from nickel instead of silver.\\r\\nIn 2002, the guilder was replaced by the euro at an exchange rate of 2.20371 guilders = 1 Euro. Coins remained exchangeable for euros at branches of the Netherlands Central Bank until 1 January 2007. Banknotes valid at the time of conversion to the euro may be exchanged there until 1 January 2032.\\r\\nIn the 18th century, coins were issued by the various provinces. There were copper 1 duit, silver 1, 2, 6 and 10 stuivers, 1 and 3 guilders, ?1?2 and 1 rijksdaalder and ?1?2 and 1 ducaton. Gold 1 and 2-ducat trade coins were also minted. Between 1795 and 1806, the Batavian Republic issued coins in similar denominations to the earlier provincial issues. The Kingdom of Holland minted silver 10 stuivers, 1 florin and 1 guilder (equivalent), 50 stuivers and ?2?1?2 guilder (also equivalent) and 1 rijksdaalder, along with gold 10 and 20 guilders. Before decimalization, the Kingdom of the Netherlands briefly issued some 1 rijksdaalder coins.\\r\\nThe gold 1 and 2 ducat and silver ducat (rijksdaalder) are still minted today as bullion coins.\\r\\nIn 1817, the first coins of the decimal currency were issued, the copper 1 cent and silver 3 guilders. The remaining denominations were introduced in 1818. These were copper ?1?2 cents, silver 5, 10 and 25 cents, ?1?2 and 1 guilder, and gold 10 guilders. In 1826, gold 5-guilder coins were introduced.\\r\\nIn 1840, the silver content of the coinage was reduced (see above) and this was marked by the replacement of the 3-guilder coin by a ?2?1?2-guilder piece. The gold coinage was completely suspended in 1853, five years after the suspension of the gold standard. By 1874, production of silver coins greater in value than 10 cents had ceased, to be only fully resumed in the 1890s. Gold 10 guilder coins were struck again from 1875. In 1877, bronze ?2?1?2-cent coins were introduced. In 1907, silver 5 cent coins were replaced by round, cupro-nickel pieces. These were later replaced in 1913 by square shaped 5 cent pieces. In 1912, gold 5 guilder coins were reintroduced but the gold coinage was ended in 1933. The 1/2 guilder saw discontinuation after 1930. Throughout the Wilhelmina period, a number of infrequent changes were made to the 10 and 25 cent coins as well, with the largest changes being periodic updates of the Queen's effigy and smaller changes to designs on the reverse (back).\\r\\nIn 1941, following the German occupation, production of all earlier coin types ceased and zinc coins were introduced by the occupational government for 1, ?2?1?2, 5, 10 and 25 cents. Large quantities of pre-war type silver 10 and 25 cents and 1-guilder coins were minted in the United States between 1943 and 1945 for use following liberation. Afterwards, the zinc coins were quickly demonetized and melted.\\r\\nIn 1948, all half cents and ?2?1?2 cents were taken out of circulation, though no further production of either denomination had continued after 1940 and 1942, respectively. New bronze 1 and 5 cent coins featuring Queen Wilhelmina on the obverse were issued, phasing out previous types. At the same time, new nickel 10 and 25 cent coins were introduced. In 1949, 1 and ?2?1?2 guilder banknotes were introduced. Five years later, the silver 1-guilder coin was reintroduced, followed by the silver ?2?1?2-guilder coin in 1959. The silver content was replaced with nickel in 1967, although no ?2?1?2-guilder coins were minted in 1967 and 1968. The silver coins were demonetized in 1973. In 1950, Queen Juliana's profile replaced the image of Wilhelmina on the obverse (front) of all coins.\\r\\nIn 1980, production of the one cent coin ceased and was demonetized the same year. Soon after, it was decided to replace the 5 guilder banknote with a coin of the same value. However, it wasn't until 1988 that a bronze-coated nickel 5 guilder coin was finally introduced. The 5-guilder banknote remained legal tender until 1995. The ?2?1?2 guilder coin gradually began losing widespread use shortly after the introduction of the 5 guilder coin, and mintage figures for the denomination declined until the discontinuation of the guilder. 1980 also saw a circulating two coin commemorative series of 1 and ?2?1?2 guilder coins celebrating Queen Beatrix's ascension to the throne.\\r\\nAll circulating coins went through a complete redesign in 1982, a short while after Queen Beatrix's coronation. They depict abstract designs featuring grids and a layered silhouette profile of the Queen as opposed to the more formal designs of the previous generation of coins. Production of these coins ceased after 2001.\\r\\nAt the time of withdrawal, the following denominations of coins were circulating:\\r\\nAll the coins carried a profile image of the Queen on the obverse and a simple grid on the other side. The 1-guilder, ?2?1?2-guilder, and 5-guilder coins had God zij met ons (\\"God be with us\\") inscribed on the edge.\\r\\nBetween 1814 and 1838, The Dutch Bank issued notes in denominations of 25, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200, 300, 500 and 1000 guilders. These were followed, from 1846 by state notes (muntbiljetten) in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 guilders, with the 10 and 50 guilders issued until 1914.\\r\\nIn 1904, the Netherlands Bank recommenced the issuance of paper money. By 1911, it was issuing notes for 10, 25, 40, 60, 100, 200, 300 and 1000 guilders. In 1914, because of silver shortage for minting, the government introduced silver certificates (zilverbonnen) for 1, ?2?1?2 and 5 guilders. Although the 5-guilder notes were only issued that year, the 1-guilder notes continued until 1920 and the ?2?1?2-guilder until 1927.\\r\\nIn 1926, the Netherlands Bank introduced 20 guilder notes, followed by 50 guilder in 1929 and 500 guilder in 1930. These introductions followed the cessation of production of the unusual 40, 60 and 300-guilder notes during the 1920s.\\r\\nIn 1938, silver notes were reintroduced for 1 and ?2?1?2 guilders. During World War II, the Netherlands Bank continued to issue paper money, although there were some design changes, most notably, the replacement of a portrait of Queen Emma by a Rembrandt portrait on the 10-guilder note. The Allies printed state notes dated 1943 for use following liberation. These were in denominations of 1, ?2?1?2, 10, 25, 50 and 100 guilders. More state notes were issued for 1 and ?2?1?2 guilders in 1945 and 1949.\\r\\nFollowing the war, The Dutch Bank introduced notes for 10, 20, 25, 50, 100 and 1000 guilders. The last 20 guilder notes were dated 1955, whilst 5-guilder notes were introduced in 1966 (replaced by coins in 1988) and 250-guilder notes in 1985.\\r\\nAt the time of withdrawal, the following denominations of banknotes were circulating:\\r\\nAt the time of withdrawal, all but the 50 and 250-guilder notes had been issued in a new series that was the same colour as the older, long-serving notes but with a mostly abstract pattern, featuring a different bird for each denomination.\\r\\nPersons depicted on older banknotes were:\\r\\nThese 1970s \\"face\\"-notes and the 1980s ?50 (sunflower), ?100 (snipe) and ?250 (lighthouse) were designed by R.D.E.

It is best known today for a string of (mainly) mid-to-late 1970s hit singles that are staples of classic rock radio, as well as several earlier psychedelic rock albums. Miller left his first band to move to San Francisco and form the Steve Miller Blues Band. Shortly after Harvey Kornspan negotiated the bands landmark contract with Capitol Records in 1967, the band shortened its name to the Steve Miller Band. In February 1968, the band recorded its debut album, Children of the Future. It went on to produce the albums Sailor, Brave New World, Your Saving Grace, Number 5, Rock Love and more. The band's Greatest Hits 1974ÿ78, released in 1978, sold over 13 million copies. The band continued to produce more albums and in 2014 toured with the rock band Journey In 2016, Steve Miller was inducted as a solo artist in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, after moving to Chicago to play the blues, Steve Miller and keyboardist Barry Goldberg founded the Goldberg-Miller Blues Band along with bassist Roy Ruby, rhythm guitarist Craymore Stevens, and drummer Maurice McKinley. The band was contracted to Epic Records after playing many Chicago clubs. They also appeared on Hullabaloo with the Four Tops and the Supremes.\\r\\nMiller left the group to go to San Francisco, where the psychedelic scene was flourishing. He then formed the Steve Miller Blues Band. Harvey Kornspan, managing partner, wrote and negotiated the band's landmark contract ($860,000 over five years as well as $25,000 of promotion money that was to be spent at the band's discretion) with Capitol/EMI Records then-president Alan Livingston in 1967. Shortly after, the band's name was shortened to the Steve Miller Band in order to broaden its appeal. The band, consisting of Miller, guitarist James Cooke, bassist Lonnie Turner, drummer Tim Davis (who replaced the departing Lance Haas on drums) and Jim Peterman on Hammond B3 organ, backed Chuck Berry at a gig at the Fillmore West that was released as the live album, Live at Fillmore Auditorium.[5] Guitarist Boz Scaggs joined the band soon after and the group performed at the Magic Mountain Festival and the Monterey Pop Festival in June.\\r\\nIn February 1968, while in England, the band recorded their debut album, Children of the Future, at Olympic studios with Glyn Johns as engineer/producer. The album did not score among the Top 100 album chart. The second album Sailor appeared in October 1968 and climbed the Billboard chart to #24. Successes included the single \\"Living in the USA.\\"\\r\\nBrave New World (#22, 1969) featured the songs \\"Space Cowboy\\" and \\"My Dark Hour\\". \\"Paul Ramon\\" (alias Paul McCartney) played drums, bass and sang backing vocals. This was followed by Your Saving Grace (#38, 1969) and Number 5 (#23, 1970).\\r\\nIn 1971, Miller broke his neck in a car accident. Capitol Records released the album Rock Love, featuring unreleased live performances and studio material. This is one of two Steve Miller Band albums not to be released on CD, the other being Recall the Beginning...A Journey from Eden. In 1972, the double album compilation Anthology was released, containing 16 songs from the band's first five albums.\\r\\nThe style and personnel of the band changed radically with The Joker (#1, 1973), concentrating on straightforward rock and leaving the psychedelic side of the band behind. The title track became a #1 single and was certified platinum, reaching over one million sales. It was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on January 11, 1974.[6]\\r\\nThree years later, the band returned with the album Fly Like an Eagle, which charted at #3. Three singles were released from the album: \\"Take the Money and Run\\" (#11), \\"Fly Like an Eagle\\" (#2) and their second Number One success, \\"Rock'n Me\\". Miller credits the guitar intro to \\"Rock'n Me\\" as a tribute to the classic song by Free, \\"All Right Now\\".[7]\\r\\nBook of Dreams (#2, 1977) also included three successes: \\"Jet Airliner\\" (#8), \\"Jungle Love\\" (#23) (later becoming the song played over the opening credits of the 8th season of the sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond), and \\"Swingtown\\" (#17). 1982's Abracadabra album gave Steve Miller his third Number One success with the title track. Miller's hit pushed Chicago's \\"Hard to Say I'm Sorry\\" out of the #1 spot, just as his \\"Rock'n Me\\" had knocked Chicago's \\"If You Leave Me Now\\" out of the #1 spot in 1976.[7]\\r\\nReleased in 1978, The Steve Miller Band's Greatest Hits 1974ÿ78 has sold over 13 million copies, and Miller continues to perform sold-out concerts.[8]\\r\\nBingo!, a new album of blues and R&B covers, was released on June 15, 2010. Let Your Hair Down, a companion release to Bingo!, was released 10 months later, on April 18, 2011.[9]\\r\\nFounding member Tim Davis died from complications due to diabetes on September 20, 1988, at the age of 44. Longtime band member Norton Buffalo died from lung cancer on October 30, 2009. John King (drummer during \\"The Joker\\" era) died after a short bout with kidney cancer on October 26, 2010.

Originally, the Equinox was shown at the 2003 Detroit Auto Show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pontiac Torrent was introduced in 2005 for the 2006 model year. The Pontiac Torrent was originally shown at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto Show.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiding on the GM Theta platform, the unibody is mechanically similar to the Saturn Vue and the Suzuki XL7. However, the Equinox and the Torrent are larger than the Vue, riding on a 112.5?in (2,858?mm) wheelbase, 5.9?in (150?mm) longer than the Vue. Front-wheel drive is standard, with optional all-wheel drive. They are not designed for serious off-roading like the truck-based Chevrolet Tahoe and Chevrolet TrailBlazer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2006 model year, GM updated the Equinox for the first time, as GM badges were added on the front doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first generation Equinox and Torrent were produced exclusively at the CAMI Automotive GM/Suzuki joint venture plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada. The 3.4 L LNJ V6 engine is made in China (by Shanghai GM), while the Aisin AF33 transmission is made in Japan. Starting with the 2008 model year, the Equinox Sport and Pontiac GXP were available with a 3.6?L V6 engine that was made in the United States.\\r\\nProduction ended in May 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chevrolet Equinox was not sold in Mexico during the 2009 model year.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Torrent shares its basic body structure and mechanicals with the Equinox, it does have a different front and rear styling. The suspension (FE2) and electronic power steering were both modified to feel firmer and sportier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Torrent was discontinued after the 2009 model year as part of the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand, with the last one rolling off the assembly line on September 2, 2009. A Buick Theta crossover SUV was to be made, effectively taking place of the Pontiac Torrent.[3] Instead, GM replaced the Torrent with the GMC Terrain, which shares the Theta platform with the second generation Equinox.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2008 and 2009 model years, GM offered sportier versions of the Equinox and Torrent; called Sport and GXP, respectively. Featuring the new 3.6 LY7 DOHC V6 engine paired with a new 6-speed automatic transmission (with Manual Tap Up/Down shifting capability). This larger and more powerful (264?hp (197?kW) or 40% increase) engine allowed acceleration from 0 to 60?mph (97?km/h) in under seven seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese models also received a 1?in (25?mm) lowered ride height with a performance-tuned suspension and unique front and rear body kits. The lower stance is accented by the 18?inch 5-spoke chrome wheels and the absence of the roof rack, giving them a smoother design flow compared to the standard models. The GXP had twin hood scoops, hydraulic power-assisted steering (as opposed to the electric power-assisted standard Torrent), improved interior trim with unique gauges, and a dual chrome-tipped exhaust.\\r\\n\\r\\nOptional features included navigation, heated sport leather seats, DVD entertainment system, a sunroof and all-wheel drive.[4] GM stated the Equinox Sport was the first vehicle to reflect its more cautious naming standards. Instead of using the Super Sport badge as it had in the past on higher performance vehicles (such as this one), GM opted to reserve the SS nomenclature for special models worthy of its namesake.[5] GM also prominently promoted the GXP in television advertisements by touting its horsepower advantage over the BMW X3, in an effort to brand Pontiac more as a direct, low-cost rival to BMW.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Equinox LTZ model was added[when?]. It is differentiated by its 17-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels, bright chrome door handles and bright chrome luggage rack side rail inserts. Standard interior features include heated front seats, leather seating inserts, head curtain side impact air bags, AM/FM stereo with six-disc in-dash CD changer and MP3 CD playback capability, and a Pioneer premium seven-speaker audio system. Equinox LTZ came with the same ride and handling package as LS and LT models.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges to 2008 Equinox and Torrent models included the relocation of the compass readout from the inside rearview mirror to the driver information center (on models so-equipped), and three new exterior colors: Navy Blue Metallic, Black Granite Metallic, and Golden Teal Metallic.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnStar was standard on the 2008 Equinox and Torrent. This system included for Turn-by-Turn Navigation, the first factory-installed, fully integrated GPS navigation system from OnStar. The 2008 models included an enhanced ride and handling package with stiffer shocks, bushings, and tuned spring rates. Four-wheel disc brakes with ABS and tire pressure monitoring system was standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Electronic Trailer Sway Control was introduced that integrated into the standard StabiliTrak system. This can detect the occurrence of trailer sway that may be caused by improper trailer weight balance or excessive vehicle speed. If the trailer begins to sway, StabiliTrak will apply brakes individually, independent of the driver controlling the brake pedal, to assist stabilizing the vehicle. Under these conditions a light will flash to signal the driver to reduce vehicle speed. If trailer sway continues, the system will reduce engine torque to reduce the speed of the vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead curtain side air bags were optional.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2008 model year, in tribute to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games, the Equinox and Torrent each received a special edition; the Team Canada Edition and the Podium Edition, respectively. This package added chrome-clad wheels, sunroof, premium sound system, and special badging.[6] These trims were sold only in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second generation Equinox was announced by GM on December 21, 2008, and debuted at the 2009 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.[9][10] The 2010 Equinox went on sale in June 2009. It is built on a stiffened version of the same \\"Theta\\" platform used in the previous model. The second generation Equinox was built with a pair of upgraded gasoline direct injection engines, with better fuel economy claimed by GM. Earlier 2010 models had the GM badges on the front doors, but were later deleted.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarketing of Chevrolet Equinox resumed in Mexico during late November 2009, for the 2010 model year after a year of absence. Sales of the Chevrolet Equinox to Mexico were stopped after the 2011 model year. However, in October 2015 the Equinox was reintroduced in Mexico to replace the Captiva Sport for the 2016 model year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second generation Equinox is available standard with a 2.4-liter straight-4 engine produced in Tonawanda, New York and Spring Hill, Tennessee, with a 3.0-liter V6 engine is available as an option.[12] Both powertrains contain six-speed automatics and optional all-wheel-drive systems, with front-wheel-drive being standard.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second generation Equinox is Chevrolet's third best-selling vehicle in North America, after the Silverado and Cruze, respectively.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2013 model year, a new direct-injected 3.6L V-6 became available on LT and LTZ models, providing 301 horsepower (225?kW) and 272?lb.-ft. of torque (369 Nm). This engine offered 14 percent more horsepower and 22 percent more torque than the previous 3.0L V-6, with the same EPA-estimated fuel economy. A new FE2 suspension package was offered, matched with the 3.6L V-6 and packaged with 18-inch or 19-inch chrome-clad wheels on LTZ models. The 2013 model year introduced Chevrolet MyLink telematics system to the Equinox.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional new features for 2013 models included a dual-player DVD entertainment system, a Power convenience package, a safety package with lane departure warning system, forward collision warning and rear park assist, as well as three new exterior colors; Champagne Silver Metallic, Atlantis Metallic and Tungsten Metallic.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2014 model year, chrome-clad wheels became standard on LTZ models, and two new exterior colors, Red Rock Metallic and Silver Topaz Metallic became available.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2015 model year saw the addition of OnStar with 4G LTE and built-in Wi-Fi hotspot, which included a 3GB/three-month data trial, standard on LT and LTZ models, with navigation available on LTZ and 2LT. Blue Velvet Metallic and Sea Grass Metallic were added as the list of available exterior colors.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2016, the Chevrolet Equinox received its first mid-cycle refresh along with its cousin the GMC Terrain, which was unveiled at the 2015 Chicago Auto Show on February 12, 2015. The refreshed Equinox received a new grille, headlights and front fascia as well as reworked tail lights. In the interior, the Equinox gained a new gear selector, a second storage shelf underneath the dashboard, as well as deletion of the door lock buttons from the dashboard. A new level trim, L, was introduced as the base level, as LS was made the second level, followed by LT and another new trim Premier (replacing LTZ for 2017). Both LT1, LT2, and LTZ level trims were discontinued. Premier took the place of LTZ.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore features are in LTZ and LS trims, while LT is unchanged from 2015. However, the OnStar delete feature was removed along with the discontinuation of five color palates, the CD/AM/FM/MP3/WMA Playback audio system, the rear seat entertainment system and one set of 19-inch chrome wheels. In its place are the Chevrolet MyLink system that became standard on all trims, four new color palates, and new 17- and 18-inch wheel trims.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nSkepticism about the Equinox's EPA fuel economy ratings has been raised after a number of road tests at the model's launch achieved 20 to 30% lower fuel economy than the official EPA ratings. After achieving 18.8?mpg?US (12.5?L/100?km; 22.6?mpg?imp) in a road test, Edmunds InsideLine stated, \\"...our testing didn't come close to achieving [the EPA's numbers], even though we're usually within 1 mpg of the EPA combined number. \\"[17] Car and Driver recorded another 18?mpg?US (13?L/100?km; 22?mpg?imp) figure and noted its \\"...fuel economy that wont live up to the 22?mpg?US (11?L/100?km; 26?mpg?imp)/32?mpg?US (7.4?L/100?km; 38?mpg?imp) EPA ratings in real-world use...\\".[18] Green Car Reports recorded as much as 25.8?mpg?US (9.1?L/100?km; 31.0?mpg?imp) on a road trip, driving almost exclusively highway miles in \\"Eco\\" mode;[19] this is about 20% below the published highway EPA rating. AutoWeek only averaged 23?mpg?US (10?L/100?km; 28?mpg?imp).[20] The Truth About Cars published an editorial suggesting that GM \\"inflated\\" the Equinox's fuel economy ratings for public relations purposes and that the trip computer inaccurately reports fuel economy reported to the driver.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nMotorweek, however, managed to achieve 29.3?mpg?US (8.0?L/100?km; 35.2?mpg?imp) with their test car during mixed driving.[22] LeftlaneNews.com was also able to average 28?mpg?US (8.4?L/100?km; 34?mpg?imp) average in mixed city and highway driving.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nChevrolet unveiled the third-generation Equinox on the autumnal equinox on September 22, 2016.[1] Gasoline-powered variants of the 2018 Chevrolet Equinox went on sale in early 2017, while diesel-powered variants arrived in autumn 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third-generation Equinox is available with up to three engine choices.  Gasoline engines are identical to the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu: a 1.5L turbocharged inline four-cylinder (I4) engine that produces 170 horsepower (12?hp less than the 2.4L engine in the previous Equinox but more torque), a 2.0L turbocharged I4 engine that produces 252 horsepower (48?hp less than the 3.6L V6 engine in the previous Equinox), or a 1.6L turbo-diesel I4 engine that produces 136 horsepower (the latter will also be available in future Chevrolet Cruze models as well). The 3.6L V6 engine option did not carry on to the third generation. The 2.0L unit will also be paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew safety features introduced in the third-generation Equinox include a surround-view camera, forward collision warning, low-speed automatic braking, a Safety Alert Seat that uses vibration pulses to help alert the driver and avoid crashes, as well as a Rear Seat Alert system that alerts drivers who had opened the back door at the start of a trip to check the back seat once they get to their destination, a feature first introduced on the 2017 GMC Acadia.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third-generation Equinox also introduced new AWD system from GKN Driveline, which allows the driver to disengage the driveshaft to reduce friction and rotational inertia during the times the AWD is not needed.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nChevrolet has released preliminary specifications for the 2018 Equinox. The third-generation Equinox will be available in four distinct trim levels: L, LS, LT, and Premier, all of which in the United States will only offer a single engine option (1.5L Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder: I4). Each trim level will feature its own list of standard equipment:[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nL/1SM: 1.5L Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, six-speed automatic transmission, Seventeen-inch all-season tires, seventeen-inch aluminum alloy wheels, Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system (Seven-inch (7.0\\") color touch-screen display, AM/FM radio, Bluetooth with A2DP wireless streaming stereo audio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, USB integration, and OnStar 4G LTE connectivity), rear view backup camera system, six-speaker audio system, power windows and door locks, keyless entry, keyless access system, keyless ignition with push-button start,  and premium cloth seating surfaces. There are no available options for this trim, being the \\"base\\" Chevrolet Equinox trim. The base trim is available only with Front-Wheel-Drive (FWD).\\r\\n\\r\\nLS/1LS: Sixteen-inch compact spare tire with steel spare wheel. Available options are limited for this trim, being one of the less-expensive Chevrolet Equinox trims.\\r\\n\\r\\nLT/1LT: SiriusXM Satellite Radio, power-adjustable front driver's bucket seat, remote start, High Intensity Discharge (HID) front head lamps, and leather-wrapped transmission gear selector. Available options include an eight-inch (8.0\\") Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system, and advanced driver assistance technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nPremier/1LZ: Eighteen-inch all-season tires, Eighteen-inch aluminum alloy wheels Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system (Eight-inch (8.0\\") color touch-screen display, AM-FM radio, HD Radio, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, Bluetooth with A2DP streaming stereo audio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, wireless charging capabilities, USB integration, and OnStar 4G LTE connectivity), remote vehicle starter system, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, heated dual front bucket seats, rear park assist system, leather-wrapped steering wheel, front-mounted fog lamps, LED front headlamps and LED rear tail lamps, and power rear tailgate. Available options include a GPS navigation radio, a Bose premium seven-speaker audio system, and advanced driver assistance technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso there will be one appearance package available on the Equinox known as the Redline Edition. The Redline Edition is only available on the LT trim without the panoramic sunroof or diesel engine. The Redline Edition will be available in October 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolden launched the Holden Equinox (EQ series) in Australia in November 2017, with the first cars scheduled to arrive in December. It is available with a 1.5 L turbocharged engine on the base LS and LS+ models, while the more potent 2.0 L turbocharged model is available for all other models - LT, LTZ and LTZ-V. The 1.6 L turbo-diesel engine will launch in 2018.[29] It is produced at GM's Ramos Arizpe assembly facility in Mexico, and replaced the Korean-built five-seat Captiva.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australasian Equinox will be sold alongside the seven-seat Holden Acadia, known as the GMC Acadia in the Americas, rather than the Chevrolet Traverse, which sits above the Equinox in select Chevrolet markets.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chevrolet Equinox Fuel cell vehicle uses hydrogen for fuel with water as its only exhaust. The Equinox Fuel Cell uses the fourth-generation hydrogen technology found in the Chevrolet Sequel concept, which was unveiled in September 2009. The fuel cell is designed for only 50,000 miles (80,000?km) of driving, but is engineered to be operable in subfreezing temperatures throughout its life. GM states that the Equinox Fuel Cell is about 500 pounds (230?kg) heavier than the original Equinox and has one inch less ground clearance. To reduce weight, it has aluminum doors and a carbon fiber hood. It uses headlights from the Pontiac Torrent.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA dashboard mounted screen calculates the fuel savings to that of a gasoline-powered Equinox. It also includes a kilowatt meter and a fuel cell energy display. The fuel cell has four vapor outlets that replace the exhaust pipe. Three carbon-fiber fuel tanks store up to a maximum of 9.25 pounds (4.2?kg) of gaseous hydrogen at 10,000?psi (70 MPa), and give the Equinox a range of 200 miles (320?km). The Equinox Fuel Cell is certified by the EPA as a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV). GM built 115 Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell vehicles and deployed them in 2007ÿ2008 in several target areas including New York and California as part of a comprehensive plan dubbed \\"Project Driveway\\".[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Equinox Fuel Cell includes safety features such as ABS, traction control system, and GM's OnStar telematics service, which offers drivers advice on operating the cars as well as information on nearby hydrogen filling stations. The car meets all 2007 federal safety standards.\\r\\n\\r\\nMotor Trend assessed the vehicle's performance as nearly the same as the 3.6 litre gasoline powered equivalent, while bemoaning the dearth of high pressure hydrogen filling stations near Riverside, California in 2008.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, Nat G CNG Solutions and AGA Systems announced that they had begun offering a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) version of the Chevy Equinox and the GMC Terrain using the 2.4 L Direct Injection engine. The natural gas version is a \\"bi-fuel\\" CNG vehicle, meaning it runs on either gasoline or natural gas, giving it extended range. The Terrain/Equinox were the first direct injection natural gas vehicles ever approved by the US EPA.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nSilver Eagle Distributors, a distributor of Anheuser-Busch products, was the launch customer for the natural gas version with an initial order of up to 100 of the natural gas GMC Terrains. CenterPoint Energy was an early customer of the natural gas Chevy Equinox.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CNG version was available for newly purchased Equinox through select dealers or as a retrofit on 2013 and 2014 models. Nat G CNG Solutions offered the vehicle in two options: a two-seater \\"cargo version\\" and a five-seat \\"passenger version.\\" The cargo version has an 837-mile combined gasoline / natural gas (9.2 gge of CNG) while the passenger version has a 775-mile combined highway range (6.8 gge of CNG).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe companies claimed that the natural gas version had tested at the EPA lab at 31 mpg highway on natural gas and had achieved a Bin 3 emissions equivalent to the Toyota Prius.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmp Electric Vehicles sells an all-electric conversion of the Chevrolet Equinox.

The origin of the Boss 429 came about as a result of NASCAR.  Ford was seeking to develop a Hemi engine that could compete with the famed 426 Hemi from Chrysler in NASCAR's Sprint Cup Series (then known as \\"Grand National Division\\").  NASCAR's homologation rules required that at least 500 cars be fitted with this motor and sold to the general public.  After much consideration, it was decided by Ford that the Mustang would be the car that would house this new engine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boss 429 engine was derived from the Ford 385 engine. It used four-bolt mains, a forged steel crank and forged steel connecting rods. The engine featured aluminum cylinder heads, with a modified Hemi type combustion chamber which Ford called \\"crescent\\". These heads used the \\"dry-deck\\" method, meaning no head gaskets were used. Each cylinder, oil passage and water passage had an individual \\"O\\" ring style seal to seal it tight. The Boss 429 engine used a single Holley 4-barrel carburetor rated at 735 CFM mounted on an aluminum intake manifold that flowed well for its time.[2] 1969 cars featured a hydraulic lifter camshaft while 1970 models got a mechanical lifter camshaft along with an improved dual exhaust system though rated power output stayed the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mustang's engine compartment was not wide enough to accommodate the massive Boss 429 engine. As a result Ford assigned Kar Kraft of Dearborn, MI to modify 4 speed Cobra Jet Mustangs to accept the new Boss 429 Engine. Kar Kraft was a Ford exclusive contracted experimental vehicle facility that functioned as Vehicle Engineering for Ford Special Vehicles. Kar Kraft had previously developed the first GT40 MKII's (winner of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans) and designed and built the GT40 MKIV's (winner of the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans).\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction of the Boss 429 began in 1968 at Kar Kraft's new assembly plant in Brighton, Michigan; the cars were transported to this plant directly from the Ford Rouge plant. The new, revised, front apron assemblies that accepted the large Boss 429 engine had been installed by the Rouge plant as the base vehicles were being built; this produced a stronger and cleaner front structure. The reworked front fenders were also installed at the Rouge plant.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext the battery was repositioned to the trunk and a stiff 3/4\\" sway bar was added to rear end to improve handling since the car was now nose heavy. This was the first Mustang ever fitted with a rear sway bar, and it notably handled much better than other big-block Mustangs of the time, making it a very capable track car. It came fitted with an 8,000rpm tachometer, and AM only radio. In addition, a hole was cut in the hood, and a manually controlled hood scoop was added to these cars. Other features included a front spoiler that was shallower than the Boss 302 spoiler, color keyed dual racing mirrors, and an engine oil cooler. It was also equipped with a 3.91 ratio rear axle with a \\"Traction-Lock\\" limited slip differential.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cars were rated very conservatively at 375?bhp (380?PS; 280?kW) at 5200 rpm and 450?lb?ft (610?N?m) at 3400 rpm of torque.[2][3] Actual output was well over 500 horsepower (370?kW).[citation needed] Some people[according to whom?] have claimed it to produce 600 or more horsepower, citing extensive testing to prove the results[citation needed], though nothing has been actually proven. However, it is very easy to coax such power out of the semi-hemi engine due to it being factory de-tuned for street-ability purposes.[citation needed] These horsepower claims have been proven from many dynamometer test results over the years with factory stock engines;[citation needed] some rebuilt to factory specs, and others pulled directly from the cars themselves immediately after purchase, though specific output tends to vary per engine due to testing parameters.[citation needed]. The manufacturers and dealers only listed 375?hp (280?kW) because of legal issues and rising insurance costs so customers would be lured into buying these cars without the stiff fees from an insurance company, though no manufacturer has ever stated this to be true, assumingly so as to prevent possible lawsuits.[4] Despite the high horsepower and torque ratings, the car was at home in the high RPM range (the engine is said to be able to rev up to 9,000rpm for extended periods of time, which is impressive given the engines massive 7.0L displacement, though they were factory limited to 6,200rpm for insurance purposes[citation needed]), and suffered a poor (by today's standards) 0ÿ60 time as a result. However, it quickly made up for that once it got moving. The car unrestricted is said to be able to exceed speeds of up to 175mph,[citation needed] though no actual claim has been proven due to the rarity, value and collectibility of the car, making anyone who owns one reluctant to try it.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth model years featured a toned-down exterior, as compared to other Mustangs of the era (see Boss 351, Boss 302, Mach 1), in that the only external identification of the car were the Boss 429 decals on the front fenders and unique hood scoop.  The rest of the car featured a very clean look that was atypical of most Mustangs that Ford had produced, which could be deceiving to some people.\\r\\nSource:Don Eichstaedt,Resident Engineer Kar Kraft Brighton Assy.Plant - 1969/70\\r\\nKar Kraft - 1966/1970\\r\\nFord Motor Company - 1971/1991\\r\\nTo show just how special these cars were, they were given special NASCAR identification that was placed on the driver's side door.  Each car was given a \\"KK\\" number which stood for Kar Kraft.  KK #1201 was the first Boss 429 and KK #2558 was the last Boss 429 made.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately sales started to drop off for the 1970 Boss 429 Mustangs and with higher production costs, gas costs, and other internal Ford problems, it was decided that 1970 would be the last year of the Boss 429.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn present day, these cars are highly sought after.  As of 2008, auctions on eBay and at Barrett-Jackson have brought bids of over $375,000.  In 2013 a black 1969 Ford Mustang Boss 429 Fastback (unrestored) sold for $417,000 at Mecum Auctions in Kissimmee, Florida. In 2016 a restored black 1969 Boss 429 sold for $500,000 at a Barrett-Jackson auction in Palm Beach, Florida.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1969 there were 859 Boss 429s made by Ford Motor Company, two of which were Cougars for the Lincoln/Mercury Race Division. There were five different colors available in 1969 (Raven Black, Wimbledon White, Royal Maroon, Candy apple Red, and Black Jade), and the only color for the interior was black. The fully functional hood scoop was the same color as the car, and noticeably larger than anything else offered on any Ford product at the time, with the exception of the two Boss 429 Cougars. This scoop would carry over to the 1970 model year but would be painted black on all cars. To this day, it is the largest factory hood scoop ever installed on a factory produced Mustang. All these cars were a manual transmission, and there was no air conditioning available due to the size of the engine. Though not originally offered as an option, it is common to add a spoiler and window louvers commonly seen on 1969ÿ1970 Mach 1's and Boss 302's. Some early cars were known as \\"S\\" code cars and as such had a slightly different engine.  These cars had magnesium valve covers, NASCAR style forged internals, nearly no smog or emissions equipment and are said to be more powerful than the later \\"T\\" and \\"A\\" code engines which had the emissions related equipment to satisfy government regulations. The engines in some cases were removed from the cars for use in other applications such as tractor pulling, due to the extreme torque and horsepower the engine was capable of producing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1970 there were 499 Boss 429s made by Ford Motor Company.  There were five new exterior colors (Grabber Orange, Grabber Green, Grabber Blue, Calypso Coral, and Pastel Blue) and the interior was available in black or white and black.  The hood scoops for this year were all painted matte black regardless of the color of the car.  These cars also had a manual transmission and no AC was available, again due to the size of the engine. The Hurst Shifter was also standard equipment for this year. A dealer-installed option of a six-pack intake and carburetors was also made available; however very few of these were sold.","field3":"How many colors were offered for the 1969 ford mustang boss 429?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"over 16,000","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"A publicly owned treatment works (POTW) is a term used in the United States for a sewage treatment plant that is owned, and usually operated, by a government agency.

St. Croix's nickname is \\"Twin City\\", for its two towns on opposite ends of the island, Frederiksted on the western end and Christiansted on the east.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island was inhabited by various indigenous groups during its prehistory. Christopher Columbus landed on Santa Cruz, as he called it, on November 14, 1493, and immediately was attacked by the Kalinago, who lived at Salt River on the north shore. This is the first recorded fight between the Spanish and a New World native population, and Columbus gave the battle site the name Cabo de la Flecha (Cape of the Arrow).[3] The Spanish never colonized the Islands, but most or all of the native population was eventually dispersed or killed. By the end of the 16th century, the islands were said to be uninhabited.[4]\\r\\nDutch and English settlers landed St. Croix in 1625, joined by some French refugees from St. Kitts. However, the English expelled the settlers, before they themselves were evicted by a Spanish invasion in August 1650. The Spanish occupation was short lived, since a French force of 166 men attacked, and in the following year 1651 had established a colony of 300 on the island. From 1651 until 1664, the Knights of Malta ruled the island in the name of Louis XIV. The island then passed to the French West India Company. The colony was evacuated to San Domingo in 1695, when France battled the English and Dutch in the War of the Grand Alliance. The island then lay uninhabited and abandoned for another 38 years.[5]\\r\\nIn 1725, St. Thomas Governor Frederick Moth encouraged the Danish West Indies Company's directors to consider purchasing Ste. Cruds (St. Croix). On 15 June 1733, France and Denmark-Norway concluded a treaty by which the Danish West India Company bought St. Croix for 750,000 livres. Louis XV ratified the treaty on 28 June, and received half the payment in French coins, with the remaining half paid in 18 months. On 16 Nov. 1733, Moth was named the first Danish governor of St. Croix. The 1742 census lists 120 sugar plantations, 122 cotton plantations, and 1906 slaves, with about 300 Englishmen and 60 Danes on the island. By 1754, the number of slaves had grown to 7,566. That year, King Frederick took direct control of St. Croix from the company.[6][5]\\r\\nFor nearly 200 years, St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John were known as the Danish West Indies. By the mid to late 18th century, \\"at the peak of the plantation economy, the enslaved population of St. Croix numbered between 18,000 and 20,000, the white population ranging between 1,500 and 2,000\\".[7]\\r\\nAlexander Hamilton and his brother lived with their mother Rachel \\"Faucette\\" on St. Croix, after she returned to the island in 1765. Their residence was in the upper floor of a house at 34 Company Street, while Rachel used the lower floor as a shop selling food items. Within two years, however, Hamilton lost his father, James Hamilton, by abandonment, and his mother to death. Official documents from the island, a 1768 probate court testimony from his uncle, established Alexander's age at thirteen. By 1769, Hamilton's cousin, aunt, uncle, and grandmother had also died. His brother James became an apprentice carpenter, and Alexander Hamilton became the ward of Thomas Stevens, a merchant on King Street. Hamilton was soon clerking in the export-import business of Beekman and Cruger, at the intersection of King and King's Cross Streets. In 1772, local businessmen funded Hamilton's further education in New York.[8]\\r\\nThe British invasion and occupation of the Danish West Indies took place at the end of March 1801, with the arrival of a British fleet arrived at St Thomas. Denmark-Norway accepted the Articles of Capitulation and the Britain occupied the islands without a shot being fired. Their occupation lasted only until April 1802, when Britain returned the islands to Denmark-Norway.\\r\\nA second British invasion of the Danish West Indies took place in December 1807, when a British fleet captured St Thomas on 22 December, and St. Croix on 25 December. Denmark-Norway did not resist and the invasion again was bloodless. This occupation lasted until 20 November 1815. Both invasions were due to Denmark's alliance with France during the Napoleonic Wars. On the conclusion of a peace with France, the islands were returned to Denmark.\\r\\nIn 1916, Denmark sold St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John to the United States, formalizing the transfer in the Treaty of the Danish West Indies, in exchange for a sum of US$25 million in gold. In a national referendum on the issue, 64.2% of Danish voters approved the sale. An unofficial referendum held in the islands resulted in 99.83% vote in favor of the purchase. Formal transfer of the islands to the U.S. took place on April 1, 1917.\\r\\nThe island's inhabitants were granted United States citizenship in 1927. Industrialization of the island and its move away from an agrarian society took place in the 1960s. The 2012 shutdown of the Hovensa refinery resulted in the loss of many jobs. Agriculture has seen a slow resurgence, due to an increase in demand for local produce and agricultural products.\\r\\nSt. Croix lies at 1745N 6445W? / ?17.750N 64.750W? / 17.750; -64.750: the easternmost point in the United States of America (as measured from the center of the continental United States, ignoring the westernmost of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska just west of the 180th meridian) is St. Croix's Point Udall. The island has an area of 214.66?km2 (82.88?sq?mi). The terrain is rugged, though not extremely so. The highest point on the island, Mount Eagle, is 1,165 feet (355?m) high. Most of the east end is quite hilly and steep, as is the north side from Christiansted west. From the north side hills, a fairly even plain slopes down to the south coast: this was cultivated as the prime sugar land on the island.\\r\\nThe trade wind blows more or less along the length of the island. The hills of the western part of the island receive a good deal more rain than the east end; annual rainfall is on the whole extremely variable, averaging perhaps 40 inches (1,000?mm) a year. The east end of the island is a dry desert range with a substantial amount of cactus, while the west end has lush vegetation and palm trees. The island has multiple ecosystems in a small geographic area. Fairly severe and extended drought has always been a problem, particularly considering the lack of fresh ground water and lack of freshwater streams or rivers on the island. The island has a desalination plant, but most residential homes and businesses have built-in cisterns used to collect rainwater.\\r\\nInhabitants are called Crucians /?kru???n/[9] (frequently written as \\"Cruzans\\").\\r\\nDue to St. Croix's history of immigration, there is much debate as to what constitutes a native Crucian. The consensus in Crucian society is that if one is bahn ya (\\"born here\\" in Crucian dialect) on St. Croix, they can claim to be Crucian, but not necessarily a native Crucian. Those considered to be the native Crucians (or by the more politically correct term: ancestral native Crucian) of St. Croix are persons who can trace their ancestry to the era prior to U.S. Virgin Islands acquisition of American citizenship in 1927. Ancestral native Crucians (approximately one-fourth to one-third of St. Croix's population) largely consist of the descendants of enslaved Africans brought to the island by Europeans during the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as the descendants of paid laborers recruited by the Danish from the British and Dutch West Indies after emancipation in 1848. As on other Caribbean islands, many ancestral natives are also descended from European settlers and planters that migrated to the West Indies during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Due to a low number of European females in the colonial West Indies, many European males in colonial St. Croix produced offspring with the majority African population, whose mixed-heritage descendants bear the surnames of their European ancestors. However, there are also a handful of ancestral families on the island (traditionally known as bukra) of full European ancestry.\\r\\nDue to historical economic and political differences, as well as the remnants of a 19th-century caste system based on skin complexion, socioeconomic class differences among ancestral native Crucians can vary widely, even within the same family. Most ancestral native Crucians today are employed by the Government of the Virgin Islands, although there are others who are involved in the tourism industry, as well as the legal and medical professions.\\r\\nPuerto Rican migration was prevalent in the 1930s, 40s and 50s, when many Puerto Ricans relocated to St. Croix for work after the collapse of the sugar industry. In addition, the U.S. Navy purchase of two-thirds of the nearby Puerto Rican island of Vieques during World War II resulted in the displacement of thousands of Viequenses, many of whom relocated to St. Croix because of its similar size and geography. The local holiday, Puerto Rico/U.S. Virgin Islands Friendship Day, has been celebrated since the 1960s on the second Monday of October, which is also the same date as Columbus Day. Puerto Ricans in St. Croix, most of whom have lived on the island for more than a generation, have kept their culture alive while integrating it into the native Crucian culture and society. For example, in informal situations, many Puerto Ricans in St. Croix speak a unique Spanglish-like combination of Puerto Rican Spanish and the local Crucian creole English.\\r\\nMigration from \\"down-island\\" (a Virgin Islander colloquial term for Caribbean islands east and south of the U.S. and British Virgin Islands), occurred mainly throughout the 1960s and 70s. In that period, agriculture declined as the major industry in St. Croix and was replaced by tourism, alumina production, and oil refining. Jobs were plentiful in these industries and down-islanders came to St. Croix by the thousands. The demand for imported labor in St. Croix was exacerbated by the fact that many ancestral native Crucians, having acquired American citizenship several decades earlier, migrated to the mainland United States to pursue educational and career opportunities. Many down-islanders made St. Croix their permanent home, while others eventually relocated to the mainland United States or returned to their native countries. Most down-islanders came from St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua, St. Lucia and Dominica, although people from every Anglophone Caribbean nation can be easily found on St. Croix. Down islanders and their St. Croix-born offspring form the majority of St. Croix's middle class, which has dwindled in size since the 2008 global recession.\\r\\nAlthough down-island migration to St. Croix is most commonly thought of as a mid-20th century phenomenon brought upon by American immigration policy, it is important to note that persons of both European and African descent from the nearby islands of Anguilla, St. Martin, Statia, Saba, St. Kitts, Nevis, Antigua, and Montserrat have been migrating to St. Croix since the 1600s. In addition, many ancestral native Crucians also share family ties with Barbados, as Bajans were heavily recruited to St. Croix to work on sugar plantations throughout the late 19th century.\\r\\nContinental Americans, although small in number in comparison with Caribbean immigrants, have also been part of the St. Croix community. Most reside on the East End of St. Croix and tend to work in the tourism industry, real estate, and legal professions. Many are temporary residents or retirees, as well.\\r\\nArab Palestinians have been an influential part of the local economy since the 1960s, when they first started to migrate to St. Croix to set up shops, supermarkets and gas stations.\\r\\nIn the 21st century, recent waves of migration to St. Croix have included people from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, the Philippines, and various South American nations.\\r\\nSt. Croix's history of migration has sometimes caused tensions between immigrants and Crucians whose ancestry on the island dates back for generations. Tensions have subsided to some extent in recent years, mainly due to intermarriage among Crucians and other Caribbean peoples. In the late 1990s, many people supported legislation to define as a \\"native U.S. Virgin Islander\\" anyone who could trace their ancestry on the island to 1927, the year in which U.S. Virgin Islanders were granted United States citizenship. This effort by a select group of nationalist senators eventually failed after much public outcry and controversy. It was learned that most native-born U.S. Virgin Islanders would not qualify as \\"native\\" under the proposed legislation, as their immigrant ancestors had arrived later than 1927, but thousands of Danish citizens would have qualified.\\r\\nIn 2009, the proposed U.S. Virgin Islands Constitution voted by the Fifth Constitutional Convention established three definitions of U.S. Virgin Islanders: \\"Ancestral Native Virgin Islander\\" - those with ancestral ties (and their descendants); \\"Native Virgin Islander\\" - those born on the island (and their descendants); and \\"Virgin Islander\\" - any United States citizen who has resided in the territory for five years. The proposed constitution was rejected by the United States Congress in 2010 for violating the principle of equal rights for all citizens of the territory, \\"native\\" or not, and was sent back to the convention for further consideration.\\r\\nThe total population of the island as per the 2010 U.S. Census is 50,601.[10]\\r\\nSt. Croix is divided into the following subdistricts (with population as per the 2010 U.S. Census):\\r\\nEnglish is the dominant language on St. Croix and has been the official language since 1917, when the Danish West Indies were purchased by the United States. Previously, the official language was Danish, although it was not widely spoken. Other languages throughout St. Croix's colonial history included Irish, Scots, Spanish and French, as well as a Dutch Creole spoken by St. Thomas and St. John-born persons living in St. Croix, as well as the local creole English, which still exists today.[11]\\r\\nKnown on the island as Crucian, Virgin Islands Creole English is spoken by the majority of the population in informal situations.[12] Spanish is spoken by Puerto Rican and Dominican (Dominican Republic) immigrants and their St. Croix-born offspring, and various French creoles are spoken by the large St. Lucian and Dominican (Dominica) communities, as well as the smaller Haitian one. Arabic is common among the large Palestinian community on St. Croix. Immigrants from the Anglophone Caribbean that migrated to St. Croix after their formative years tend to speak the English creoles of their respective islands in informal situations, which are, for the most part, mutually intelligible with Virgin Islands Creole English.\\r\\nChristianity is the predominant religion; the island has been called the \\"Land of Churches\\"[13] for the approximately 150 churches that serve its 50,000 residents.\\r\\nProtestant denominations are the most prevalent, but there is also a significant Roman Catholic presence due to St. Croix's large Hispanic population, as well as Irish influence during the Danish colonial period. Anglican, Methodist, Moravian, Presbyterian, Pentecostal and Seventh-day Adventists are among the Protestant denominations prevalent on the island. There are also followers of the Jehovah's Witness faith, as well as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS or Mormon).\\r\\nAs in most of the Caribbean, various forms of Rastafari are practiced on the island. Islam is prevalent among the small local Arab population, and there is a small Jewish presence as well.\\r\\nSt. Croix was once an agricultural powerhouse in the Caribbean, but this period ended with the rapid industrialization of the island's economy in the 1960s. Like many other Caribbean islands today, St. Croix has tourism as one of its main sources of revenue. A number of other industries on the island contribute to the economy.\\r\\nSt. Croix was home to HOVENSA, one of the world's largest oil refineries. HOVENSA is a limited liability company owned and operated by Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), a division of U.S.-based Hess Corporation, and Petroleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA), the national oil company of Venezuela. Gas prices on the island were slightly higher than average when compared to gas prices in the continental United States.\\r\\nOn January 18, 2012, the company announced that the HOVENSA refinery would be permanently shut down. This was expected to have a major adverse effect on the economy of St. Croix and the entire U.S. Virgin Islands, as the refinery employed 1,200 residents and 950 contractors.[14]\\r\\nSt. Croix is also home to the Cruzan Rum Distillery,[15] makers of Cruzan Rum, a brand of Beam Suntory, Inc. The Cruzan Rum Distillery was founded in 1760 as Estate Diamond, and for many years used locally grown sugar cane to produce a single \\"dark\\" style rum. The distillery now imports sugar cane molasses from other countries in the region, primarily from the Dominican Republic and South America. In recent years, Cruzan Rum, along with Bacardi from Puerto Rico and Gosling's from Bermuda, has contributed to the resurgence of \\"single barrel,\\" super-premium rum. The quality and smoothness of the Cruzan Estate Rums has won more than 30 Spirit Awards.[16] Cruzan Estate Diamond Rum (aged five years in American oak barrels) and Cruzan Single Barrel Estate Rum (aged 12 years in American oak barrels) are two examples.\\r\\nDiageo has completed construction of a new distillery on a 26-acre industrial site next to the Hovensa Refinery. The new distillery produces Captain Morgan Rum.[17] Diageo's entrance into the U.S. Virgin Islands rum industry has been controversial. The cash-strapped U.S. Virgin Islands government secured $250 million in bonds for the plant, about which the Puerto Rican government has bitterly complained.\\r\\nCars drive on the left hand side of the road, but nearly all the automobiles on the island have left side steering columns. This has proven difficult for new residents and visitors from right-hand traffic locales such as the mainland United States, the French and Dutch West Indies, and Puerto Rico.\\r\\nThere is a public bus service called Virgin Islands Transit, also known as VITRAN, operated by the Virgin Islands Department of Public Works.\\r\\nIn addition to taxis and buses, St. Croix has shared taxis, locally known as \\"taxi buses\\" (also found on the other U.S. Virgin Islands). Taxi buses are full-sized vans running a route from Frederiksted to Christiansted. Taxi buses are privately owned and operated; they do not follow a regular schedule, and there are no pre-specified stops. People simply wait by the side of the road until a taxi bus approaches, then flag the driver down by waving. Passengers can get out anywhere along the taxi route. Taxi buses are not metered and are required by law to charge a flat rate of $2.50, regardless of where a rider gets on and off. Taxis to specific locations are much more expensive and are typically used by tourists.\\r\\nFerry service to St. Thomas was restarted in April, 2017. The QE IV Ferry makes two trips per day to St. Thomas. Ferry companies based in St. Thomas and St. John sometimes operate St. Croix-to-St. Thomas service for special occasions, such as the St. Croix Agricultural Fair in February, Virgin Islands Carnival, Crucian Christmas Carnival, as well as horse races.\\r\\nThe Henry E. Rohlsen International Airport serves St. Croix with regular flights from the U.S. mainland, Puerto Rico, and the Eastern Caribbean. Seaplanes, operated by Seaborne Airlines, make the trip from St. Croix to St. Thomas, departing and arriving in Christiansted Harbor.\\r\\nAlthough St. Croix is a U.S. territory, the U.S. Virgin Islands are maintained as a free port in a separate customs zone. Therefore, travelers to and from the contiguous United States and Puerto Rico must clear U.S. customs but do not need to present a passport, and only need proof of U.S. citizenship or nationality. The immigration status of non-U.S. citizens may be verified during this process.\\r\\nThe St. Croix School District operates public schools in St. Croix.[18] There also exist multiple private schools, including, but not limited to, St. Croix Montessori, Star Apple Montessori School, The Good Hope Country Day School, AZ Academy, St. Mary's Catholic School, Free Will Baptist, St. Croix SDA School, and The Manor School. The only colleges on the island are the University of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix campus and Barry University, which operates a physician assistant training program.\\r\\nThe island's largest festival, termed \\"Crucian Christmas Carnival,\\" is celebrated on St. Croix throughout late December and early January. Another significant festival is the Agricultural and Food Fair held in mid-February.\\r\\nSeveral times a year, there is a nighttime festival in Christiansted called \\"Jump-Up\\" and a monthly event called \\"Sunset Jazz\\" in Frederiksted, where local jazz musicians play on Frederiksted Beach. Every year on the Saturday before Mardi Gras, there is a local Mardi Croix parade and a dog parade through the North Shore.\\r\\nThe St. Croix Half Ironman Triathlon is held in the first week of May.[19] The Triathlon includes a 1.2-mile (1.9?km) swim, a 56-mile (90?km) bike ride, and a 13.1-mile (21.1?km) run. Because the bicycle route includes a ride up an extremely steep hill known as \\"The Beast\\", this triathlon is often nicknamed \\"Beauty and the Beast\\".\\r\\nA costumed carnival dancer.\\r\\nParade of costumed carnival dancers.\\r\\nA costumed carnival dancer.\\r\\nA costumed carnival dancer.\\r\\nA Moko jumbie.\\r\\nFrederiksted maintains its Victorian era architecture and original seven street by seven street city design and is host to several historic structures. Among them are St. Patrick's Catholic Church built in the 1840s and its primary school, the Customs House, the 19th Century Apothecary, and many other buildings; some of which due to hurricanes past have fallen into very scenic ruins. Frederiksted operates at a more relaxed pace than most of the island, and is more lively during Carnival in January and whenever visiting cruise ships are in port.\\r\\nSalt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve contains the only known site where members of a Columbus expedition set foot on what is now United States territory. It also preserves upland watersheds, mangrove forests, and estuarine and marine environments that support threatened and endangered species. The site is marked by Fort Sal, a remaining earthworks fortification from the French period of occupation, about 1617. The park also preserves prehistoric and colonial-era archeological sites including the only existent example of a ball court in the Caribbean. This is one of two sites on the island for bioluminescent bays (the other being Altona Lagoon).\\r\\nFort Christiansv?rn built in 1749 and other buildings are maintained by the National Park Service as the Christiansted National Historic Site.\\r\\nBuck Island Reef National Monument preserves a 176 acres (71?ha) island just north of St. Croix and the surrounding reefs. This is a popular destination for snorkelers. Buck Island maintains a U.S. Coast Guard weather station and is also home to a student monitored lemon shark breeding ground. Green Cay (pronounced green key) is a small island located southwest of Buck Island; it is managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. It hosts a nearby reef popular among scuba divers and snorkelistsTamarind Reef.\\r\\nThe waters surrounding St. Croix are warm year-round, with temperatures ranging from 25?C (77?F) ÿ 30?C (86?F), making it a popular destination for watersports including scuba diving, snorkeling, kayaking, paddleboarding, surfing, kite surfing, parasailing, jet skiing, fishing, and sailing. Two of the island's most popular underwater sites for scuba divers are the Frederiksted Pier and the drop-off into deep water at Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve.\\r\\nFrederiksted is known for reef diving and access to wreck diving. The western side of the island has calm waters that allow snorkeling with access from the beach. Paddleboarding is popular near Frederiksted for the same reason. The Frederiksted Pier attracts scuba divers and snorkellers, as well as those who simply jump off it.[20][21] The shallow water and sandy bottom around the pier are ideal for recreational diving by novice scuba divers in PADI Discover Scuba Diving programs (also called resort diving), for extended shore diving, night diving, and for underwater photography,[22] especially of its abundant seahorse population.[23][23][24]\\r\\nA few hundred meters off the northern coast of the island, from Salt River to Cane Bay, the bottom drops suddenly into a deep trench, where coral reefs, abundant tropical fish, and migrant sea turtles may be observed. Kayaking is popular in the Salt River area as well.\\r\\nThe town of Christiansted, a short distance from Buck Island and Green Cay, is a former capital of the Danish West Indies. It lies just east of the northern underwater drop-off and is protected by a reef.\\r\\nThere are two bioluminescent bays or bio bays on St Croix. The most widely known and visited is located at Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve. A second bio bay can be found at Altona Lagoon. Bio bays are extremely rare with \\"only seven year-round lagoons known to exist in the Caribbean\\".[25]\\r\\nA combination of factors creates the necessary conditions for bioluminescence: red mangrove trees surround the water (the organisms have been related to mangrove forest,[26] although mangrove is not necessarily associated with this species).[27] A study at the bio bay located at Salt River is being conducted as of 2013[update] by faculty and students from the University of South Carolina, the University of North Carolina-Wilmington and the University of the Virgin Islands. Their research is focused on analyzing quality and nutrient composition of the water, the distribution of a micro-organism, the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense, which glows whenever the water is disturbed, and the abundance of cysts, dormant dinoflagellates embedded in the sea floor.\\r\\nA concurrent complementary study is being undertaken by the St. Croix Environmental Association in conjunction with Scripps Institution of Oceanography which focuses on counting the photon density of the phenomenon over time and through various conditions of weather and other impacts. Water quality and taxonomic analysis from both studies will be shared and correlated to create one of the most thorough investigations of year-round bioluminescent bays to date.\\r\\nThe two bio bays on St Croix have very different characteristics. The one at Altona Lagoon is large in size but is very shallow allowing one to see the various marine life swimming and agitating the water, lighting it up. The bio bay at Salt River is smaller in size but is deeper than Altona Lagoon. Because of its depth this bay is also home to a second form of bioluminescence called Ctenophora or comb-jellies, which are not found at Altona Lagoon.\\r\\nA third bioluminescent organism is also found in Salt River. A species of marine fireworm performs its brilliant green mating ritual within 57 hours after the full moon, females rising to the surface and leaving a luminescent green puddle for the males to race through, fertilizing the eggs.\\r\\nChristiansted, looking north.\\r\\nChristiansted, looking northeast\\r\\nDowntown Christiansted and harbor\\r\\nOld Danish Customs House, Christiansted\\r\\nEast End\\r\\nScuba Diving in the calm waters of Frederiksted\\r\\nEast End\\r\\nTeague Bay Beach\\r\\nCanegarden Bay Beach\\r\\nSt. George Village Botanical Gardens\\r\\nScuba diver and sponges, Cane Bay wall\\r\\nScuba diver and sponges, Cane Bay wall","field3":"What language do they speak in st croix?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"1 April 2010","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act or Right to Education Act (RTE) is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted on 4 August 2009, which describes the modalities of the importance of free and compulsory education for children between the age of 6 to 14 years in India under Article 21A of the Indian Constitution.[1] India became one of 135 countries to make education a fundamental right of every child when the act came into force on 1 April 2010.[2][3][4] The title of the RTE Act incorporates the words free and compulsory. Free education means that no child, other than a child who has been admitted by his or her parents to a school which is not supported by the appropriate Government, shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education. Compulsory education casts an obligation on the appropriate Government and local authorities to provide and ensure admission, attendance and completion of elementary education by all children in the 6-14 age group. With this, India has moved forward to a rights based framework that casts a legal obligation on the Central and State Governments to implement this fundamental child right as enshrined in the Article 21A of the Constitution, in accordance with the provisions of the RTE Act.17.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPresent Act has its history in the drafting of the Indian constitution at the time of Independence[5] but is more specifically to the Constitutional Amendment of 2002 that included the Article 21A in the Indian constitution making Education a fundamental Right. This amendment, however, specified the need for a legislation to describe the mode of implementation of the same which necessitated the drafting of a separate Education Bill. It is the 86th amendment in the Indian Constitution\\r\\nA rough draft of the bill was prepared in year 2005. It caused considerable controversy due to its mandatory provision to provide 25% reservation for disadvantaged children in private schools. The sub-committee of the Central Advisory Board of Education which prepared the draft Bill held this provision as a significant prerequisite for creating a democratic and egalitarian society. Indian Law commission had initially proposed 50% reservation for disadvantaged students in private schools.[6][7]\\r\\nOn 7 May 2014, The Supreme Court of India ruled that Right to Education Act is not applicable to Minority institutions.[8]\\r\\nThe bill was approved by the cabinet on 2 July 2009.[9] Rajya Sabha passed the bill on 20 July 2009[10] and the Lok Sabha on 4 August 2009.[11] It received Presidential assent and was notified as law on 26 August 2009[12] as The Children's Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act.[13] The law came into effect in the whole of India except the state of Jammu and Kashmir from 1 April 2010, the first time in the history of India a law was brought into force by a speech by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In his speech, Dr. Singh stated, \\"We are committed to ensuring that all children, irrespective of gender and social category, have access to education. An education that enables them to acquire the skills, knowledge, values and attitudes necessary to become responsible and active citizens of India.\\"[14]\\r\\nThe RTE Act provides for the right of children to free and compulsory education till completion of elementary education in a neighbourhood school. It clarifies that compulsory education means obligation of the appropriate government to provide free elementary education and ensure compulsory admission, attendance and completion of elementary education to every child in the six to fourteen age group. Free means that no child shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education.\\r\\nIt makes provisions for a non-admitted child to be admitted to an age appropriate class.\\r\\nIt specifies the duties and responsibilities of appropriate Governments, local authority and parents in providing free and compulsory education, and sharing of financial and other responsibilities between the Central and State Governments.\\r\\nIt lays down the norms and standards relating inter alia to pupil teacher ratios (PTRs), buildings and infrastructure, school-working days, teacher-working hours.\\r\\nIt provides for rational deployment of teachers by ensuring that the specified pupil teacher ratio is maintained for each school, rather than just as an average for the State or District or Block, thus ensuring that there is no urban-rural imbalance in teacher postings. It also provides for prohibition of deployment of teachers for non-educational work, other than decennial census, elections to local authority, state legislatures and parliament, and disaster relief.\\r\\nIt provides for appointment of appropriately trained teachers, i.e. teachers with the requisite entry and academic qualifications.\\r\\nIt prohibits (a) physical punishment and mental harassment; (b) screening procedures for admission of children; (c) capitation fee; (d) private tuition by teachers and (e) running of schools without recognition.\\r\\nIt provides for development of curriculum in consonance with the values enshrined in the Constitution, and which would ensure the all-round development of the child, building on the childs knowledge, potentiality and talent and making the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety through a system of child friendly and child centered learning.\\r\\nWhat is this Act about?\\r\\nThe Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 is about a childs right to education. It ensures that all children get free education from class 1 to class 8. To achieve this, the Act lays down some duties for governments, schools, teachers and parents.\\r\\nThe Act also contains rules on pupil-teacher ratio, teacher vacancies, penalties for conducting screening tests and punishing children.\\r\\nDoes this Act apply to all children?\\r\\nThis Act only applies to children between the ages of 6 to 14. However, children who are more than 14 years old but have not been able to attend school till class 8, can get free education till class 8 under this Act.\\r\\nHow does this Act help children?\\r\\nWhy is the word compulsory used?\\r\\nThe word compulsory means that it is compulsory for the government to give free education to all children. It does not mean it is compulsory for parents to send their children to school.\\r\\nHow can a child get free education in a private school?\\r\\nPlease note that both the Central and State/UT Governments have issued rules which may contain additional or modified requirements which have to be followed by schools.\\r\\nThe Act makes education a fundamental right of every child between the ages of 6 and 14 and specifies minimum norms in elementary schools. It requires all private schools(except the minority institutions) to reserve 25% of seats for the poor and other categories of children (to be reimbursed by the state as part of the public-private partnership plan). Children are admitted in to private schools based on caste-based reservations. See Page 9 and Point no 4 of This Document. It also prohibits all unrecognised schools from practice, and makes provisions for no donation or capitation fees and no interview of the child or parent for admission.[15][16] The Act also provides that no child shall be held back, expelled, or required to pass a board examination until the completion of elementary education. There is also a provision for special training of school drop-outs to bring them up to par with students of the same age.\\r\\nThe RTE act requires survyus that will monitor all neighbourhoods, identify children requiring education, and set up facilities for providing it. The World Bank education specialist for India, Sam Carlson, has observed:\\r\\nThe Right to Education of persons with disabilities until 18 years of age is laid down under a separate legislation- the Persons with Disabilities Act. A number of other provisions regarding improvement of school infrastructure, teacher-student ratio and faculty are made in the Act.\\r\\nEducation in the Indian constitution is a concurrent issue and both centre and states can legislate on the issue. The Act lays down specific responsibilities for the centre, state and local bodies for its implementation. The states have been clamouring that they lack financial capacity to deliver education of appropriate standard in all the schools needed for universal education.[18] Thus it was clear that the central government (which collects most of the revenue) will be required to subsidise the states.\\r\\nA committee set up to study the funds requirement and funding initially estimated that Rs 1710?billion or 1.71 trillion (US$38.2 billion) across five years was required to implement the Act, and in April 2010 the central government agreed to sharing the funding for implementing the law in the ratio of 65 to 35 between the centre and the states, and a ratio of 90 to 10 for the north-eastern states.[19] However, in mid 2010, this figure was upgraded to Rs. 2310?billion, and the center agreed to raise its share to 68%.[18] There is some confusion on this, with other media reports stating that the centre's share of the implementation expenses would now be 70%.[20] At that rate, most states may not need to increase their education budgets substantially.\\r\\nA critical development in 2011 has been the decision taken in principle to extend the right to education till Class X (age 16)[21] and into the preschool age range.[22] The CABE committee is in the process of looking into the implications of making these changes.\\r\\nThe Ministry of HRD set up a high-level, 14-member National Advisory Council (NAC) for implementation of the Act. The members include\\r\\nA report on the status of implementation of the Act was released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development on the one-year anniversary of the Act. The report admits that 8.1 million children in the age group 6-14 remain out of school and theres a shortage of 508,000 teachers country-wide. A shadow report by the RTE Forum, representing the leading education networks in the country led by Ambarish Rai (a prominent activist), however, challenging the findings pointing out that several key legal commitments are falling behind the schedule.(http://www.rteforumindia.org/)[24] The Supreme Court of India has also intervened to demand implementation of the Act in the Northeast.[25] It has also provided the legal basis for ensuring pay parity between teachers in government and government aided schools[26]\\r\\nHaryana Government has assigned the duties and responsibilities to Block Elementary Education OfficersÿcumÿBlock Resource Coordinators (BEEOs-cum-BRCs) for effective implementation and continuous monitoring of implementation of Right to Education Act in the State.[27]\\r\\nIt has been pointed out that the RTE act is not new. Universal adult franchise in the act was opposed since most of the population was illiterate. Article 45 in the Constitution of India was set up as an act:\\r\\nAs that deadline was about to be passed many decades ago, the education minister at the time, M C Chagla, memorably said:\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the World Bank funded a number of measures to set up schools within easy reach of rural communities. This effort was consolidated in the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan model in the 1990s. RTE takes the process further, and makes the enrolment of children in schools a state prerogative.\\r\\nThe act has been criticised for being hastily drafted,[29] not consulting many groups active in education, not considering the quality of education, infringing on the rights of private and religious minority schools to administer their system, and for excluding children under six years of age.[30] Many of the ideas are seen as continuing the policies of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan of the last decade, and the World Bank funded District Primary Education Programme DPEP of the '90s, both of which, while having set up a number of schools in rural areas, have been criticised for being ineffective[31] and corruption-ridden.[32]\\r\\nThe quality of education provided by the government school system is not good.[33] While it remains the largest provider of elementary education in the country, forming 80% of all recognised schools, it suffers from shortage of teachers and infrastructural gaps. Several habitations lack schools altogether. There are also frequent allegations of government schools being riddled with absenteeism and mismanagement and of appointments made on political convenience. Despite the allure of free lunch in the government schools, many parents send their children to private schools. Average schoolteacher salaries in private rural schools in some States (about Rs. 4,000 per month) are considerably lower than those in government schools.[34] As a result, the proponents of low-cost private schools critiqu the government schools as being poor value for money.\\r\\nChildren attending the private schools are seen to be at an advantage, forming a discrimination against the weakest sections who are forced to go to government schools. Furthermore, the system has been criticised as catering to the rural elites who are able to afford school fees in a country where a large number of families live in absolute poverty. The act has been criticised as discriminatory for not addressing these issues. Well-known educationist Anil Sadagopal said of the hurriedly drafted act:\\r\\nEntrepreneur Gurcharan Das noted that 54% of urban children attend private schools, and this rate is growing at 3% per year. \\"Even the poor children are abandoning the government schools. They are leaving because the teachers are not showing up.\\"[29] However, other researchers have countered the argument by saying that the evidence for higher standard of quality in private schools often disappears when other factors (like family income and parental literacy) are accounted for.\\r\\nTo address these quality issues, the Act has provisions for compensating private schools for admission of children under the 25% quota which has been compared to school vouchers, whereby parents may \\"send\\" their children in any school, private or public. This measure, along with the increase in PPP (Public Private Partnership) has been viewed by some organisations such as the All-India Forum for Right to Education (AIF-RTE), as the state abdicating its \\"constitutional obligation towards providing elementary education\\".[31]\\r\\nThe Society for Un-aided Private Schools, Rajasthan (in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 95 of 2010) and as many as 31 others[35] petitioned the Supreme Court of India claiming that the act violates the constitutional right of private managements to run their institutions without governmental interference.[36] The parties claimed that providing 25 percent reservation for disadvantaged children in government and private unaided schools is \\"unconstitutional.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nForcing unaided schools to admit 25% disadvantaged students has also been criticized on the grounds that the government has partly transferred its constitutional obligation to provide free and compulsory elementary education to children on non-state actors, like private schools, while collecting a 2% cess on the total tax payable for primary education.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 April 2012, a three judge bench of the Supreme Court delivered its judgement by a majority of 2-1. Chief Justice SH Kapadia and Justice Swatanter Kumar held that providing such reservation is not unconstitutional, but stated that the Act will not be applicable to private minority schools and boarding schools. However, Justice K. S. Panicker Radhakrishnan dissented with the majority view and held that the Act cannot apply to both minority and non-minority private schools that do not receive aid from the government.[37][38][39]\\r\\nIn September 2012, the Supreme Court subsequently declined a review petition on the Act.[40]\\r\\nIn May 2016, the Chetpet-based CBSE school Maharishi Vidya Mandir became embroiled in a scandal over its circumvention of the 25% quota rule.[41] During its admissions cycle, the school told economically weaker parents \\"the RTE does not exist,\\" and, \\"we do not take these [government RTE] applications.\\" The senior principal also informed the Tamil Nadu Regional Director of the CBSE that he intended to \\"reject applicants without an email address,\\" thereby excluding technically illiterate parents from seeking admissions. In addition, school officials falsified the distance figures of several poorer candidates in attempts to disqualify them from availing of the scheme.\\r\\nThe Act provides for admission of children without any certification. However, several states have continued pre-existing procedures insisting that children produce income and caste certificates, BPL cards and birth certificates. Orphan children are often unable to produce such documents, even though they are willing to do so. As a result, schools are not admitting them, as they require the documents as a condition to admission.[42]\\r\\nSimple explainer on the Law","field3":"When was the right to education act enforced?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"autosomal recessive","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"TayÿSachs disease is a genetic disorder that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.[1] The most common type, known as infantile TayÿSachs disease, becomes apparent around three to six months of age with the baby losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl.[1] This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move.[1] Death usually occurs in early childhood.[1] Less commonly the disease may occur in later childhood or adulthood.[1] These forms are generally milder in nature.[1]\\r\\nTayÿSachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA genes on chromosome 15.[1] It is inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal recessive manner.[1] The mutation results in problems with an enzyme called beta-hexosaminidase A which results in the buildup of the molecule GM2 ganglioside within cells, leading to toxicity.[1] Diagnosis is by measuring the blood hexosaminidase A level or genetic testing.[2] It is a type of sphingolipidosis.[3]\\r\\nThe treatment of TayÿSachs disease is supportive in nature.[2] This may involve multiple specialities as well as psychosocial support for the family.[2] The disease is rare in the general population.[1] In Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians of southeastern Quebec, and Cajuns of southern Louisiana, the condition is more common.[2][1] Approximately 1 in 3,600 Ashkenazi Jews at birth are affected.[2]\\r\\nThe disease is named after Waren Tay, who in 1881 first described a symptomatic red spot on the retina of the eye; and Bernard Sachs, who described in 1887 the cellular changes and noted an increased rate of disease in Ashkenazi Jews.[4] Carriers of a single TayÿSachs allele are typically normal.[2] It has been hypothesized that being a carrier may confer protection from another condition such as tuberculosis, explaining the persistence of the allele in certain populations.[5] Researchers are looking at gene therapy or enzyme replacement therapy as possible treatments.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTayÿSachs disease is typically first noticed in infants around 6 months old displaying an abnormally strong response to sudden noises or other stimuli, known as the \\"startle response\\". There may also be listlessness or muscle stiffness (hypertonia). The disease is classified into several forms, which are differentiated based on the onset age of neurological symptoms.[6][7]\\r\\nUntil the 1970s and 1980s, when the disease's molecular genetics became known, the juvenile and adult forms of the disease were not always recognized as variants of TayÿSachs disease. Post-infantile TayÿSachs was often misdiagnosed as another neurological disorder, such as Friedreich's ataxia.[11]\\r\\nTayÿSachs disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, meaning that when both parents are carriers, there is a 25% risk of giving birth to an affected child with each pregnancy. The affected child would have received a mutated copy of the gene from each parent.[6]\\r\\nTayÿSachs results from mutations in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15, which encodes the alpha-subunit of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase?A, a lysosomal enzyme. By 2000, more than 100 different mutations had been identified in the human HEXA gene.[12] These mutations have included single base insertions and deletions, splice phase mutations, missense mutations, and other more complex patterns. Each of these mutations alters the gene's protein product (i.e., the enzyme), sometimes severely inhibiting its function.[13] In recent years, population studies and pedigree analysis have shown how such mutations arise and spread within small founder populations. Initial research focused on several such founder populations:\\r\\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, when the biochemical basis of TayÿSachs disease was first becoming known, no mutations had been sequenced directly for genetic diseases. Researchers of that era did not yet know how common polymorphisms would prove to be. The \\"Jewish Fur Trader Hypothesis,\\" with its implication that a single mutation must have spread from one population into another, reflected the knowledge at the time. Subsequent research, however, has proven that a large variety of different HEXA mutations can cause the disease. Because TayÿSachs was one of the first genetic disorders for which widespread genetic screening was possible, it is one of the first genetic disorders in which the prevalence of compound heterozygosity has been demonstrated.[18]\\r\\nCompound heterozygosity ultimately explains the disease's variability, including the late-onset forms. The disease can potentially result from the inheritance of two unrelated mutations in the HEXA gene, one from each parent. Classic infantile TayÿSachs disease results when a child has inherited mutations from both parents that completely stop the biodegradation of gangliosides. Late onset forms occur due to the diverse mutation base?ÿ people with TayÿSachs disease may technically be heterozygotes, with two differing HEXA mutations that both inactivate, alter, or inhibit enzyme activity. When a patient has at least one HEXA copy that still enables some level of hexosaminidase?A activity, a later onset disease form occurs. When disease occurs because of two unrelated mutations, the patient is said to be a compound heterozygote.[19]\\r\\nHeterozygous carriers (individuals who inherit one mutant allele) show abnormal enzyme activity but manifest no disease symptoms. This phenomenon is called dominance; the biochemical reason for wild-type alleles' dominance over nonfunctional mutant alleles in inborn errors of metabolism comes from how enzymes function. Enzymes are protein catalysts for chemical reactions; as catalysts, they speed up reactions without being used up in the process, so only small enzyme quantities are required to carry out a reaction. Someone homozygous for a nonfunctional mutation in the enzyme-encoding gene has little or no enzyme activity, so will manifest the abnormal phenotype. A heterozygote (heterozygous individual) has at least half of the normal enzyme activity level, due to expression of the wild-type allele. This level is normally enough to enable normal function and thus prevent phenotypic expression.[20]\\r\\nTayÿSachs disease is caused by insufficient activity of the enzyme hexosaminidase?A. Hexosaminidase?A is a vital hydrolytic enzyme, found in the lysosomes, that breaks down sphingolipids. When hexosaminidase?A is no longer functioning properly, the lipids accumulate in the brain and interfere with normal biological processes. Hexosaminidase?A specifically breaks down fatty acid derivatives called gangliosides; these are made and biodegraded rapidly in early life as the brain develops. Patients with and carriers of TayÿSachs can be identified by a simple blood test that measures hexosaminidase?A activity.[6]\\r\\nThe hydrolysis of GM2-ganglioside requires three proteins. Two of them are subunits of hexosaminidase?A; the third is a small glycolipid transport protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2A), which acts as a substrate-specific cofactor for the enzyme. Deficiency in any one of these proteins leads to ganglioside storage, primarily in the lysosomes of neurons. TayÿSachs disease (along with AB-variant GM2-gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) occurs because a mutation inherited from both parents deactivates or inhibits this process. Most TayÿSachs mutations probably do not directly affect protein functional elements (e.g., the active site). Instead, they cause incorrect folding (disrupting function) or disable intracellular transport.[21]\\r\\nIn patients with a clinical suspicion for TayÿSachs disease, with any age of onset, the initial testing involves an enzyme assay to measure the activity of hexosaminidase in serum, fibroblasts, or leukocytes. Total hexosaminidase enzyme activity is decreased in individuals with Tay-Sachs as is the percentage of hexosaminidase A. After confirmation of decreased enzyme activity in an individual, confirmation by molecular analysis can be pursued.[22] All patients with infantile onset TayÿSachs disease have a \\"cherry red\\" macula in the retina, easily observable by a physician using an ophthalmoscope.[6][23] This red spot is a retinal area that appears red because of gangliosides in the surrounding retinal ganglion cells. The choroidal circulation is showing through \\"red\\" in this foveal region where all retinal ganglion cells are pushed aside to increase visual acuity. Thus, this cherry-red spot is the only normal part of the retina; it shows up in contrast to the rest of the retina. Microscopic analysis of the retinal neurons shows they are distended from excess ganglioside storage.[24] Unlike other lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Gaucher disease, NiemannÿPick disease, and Sandhoff disease), hepatosplenomegaly (liver and spleen enlargement) is not seen in TayÿSachs.[25]\\r\\nThree main approaches have been used to prevent or reduce the incidence of TayÿSachs:\\r\\nAs of 2010 there was no treatment that addressed the cause of TayÿSachs disease or could slow its progression; people receive supportive care to ease the symptoms and extend life by reducing the chance of contracting infections.[31] Infants are given feeding tubes when they can no longer swallow.[32] In late-onset TayÿSachs, medication (e.g., lithium for depression) can sometimes control psychiatric symptoms and seizures, although some medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, haloperidol, and risperidone) are associated with significant adverse effects.[19][33]\\r\\nAs of 2010, even with the best care, children with infantile TayÿSachs disease usually die by the age of 4.[31] Children with the juvenile form are likely to die from the ages 5-15, while those with the adult form will probably not be affected.[citation needed]\\r\\nAshkenazi Jews have a high incidence of TayÿSachs and other lipid storage diseases. In the United States, about 1 in 27 to 1 in 30 Ashkenazi Jews is a recessive carrier. The disease incidence is about 1 in every 3,500 newborn among Ashkenazi Jews.[34] French Canadians and the Cajun community of Louisiana have an occurrence similar to the Ashkenazi Jews. Irish Americans have a 1 in 50 chance of being a carrier.[citation needed] In the general population, the incidence of carriers as heterozygotes is about 1 in 300.[7] The incidence is approximately 1 in 320,000 newborns in the general population in United States.[35]\\r\\nThree general classes of theories have been proposed to explain the high frequency of TayÿSachs carriers in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\\r\\nTayÿSachs disease was one of the first genetic disorders for which epidemiology was studied using molecular data. Studies of TayÿSachs mutations using new molecular techniques such as linkage disequilibrium and coalescence analysis have brought an emerging consensus among researchers supporting the founder effect theory.[37][39][40]\\r\\nWaren Tay and Bernard Sachs, two physicians, described the disease's progression and provided differential diagnostic criteria to distinguish it from other neurological disorders with similar symptoms.\\r\\nBoth Tay and Sachs reported their first cases among Ashkenazi Jewish families. Tay reported his observations in 1881 in the first volume of the proceedings of the British Ophthalmological Society, of which he was a founding member.[41] By 1884, he had seen three cases in a single family. Years later, Bernard Sachs, an American neurologist, reported similar findings when he reported a case of \\"arrested cerebral development\\" to other New York Neurological Society members.[42][43]\\r\\nSachs, who recognized that the disease had a familial basis, proposed that the disease should be called amaurotic familial idiocy. However, its genetic basis was still poorly understood. Although Gregor Mendel had published his article on the genetics of peas in 1865, Mendel's paper was largely forgotten for more than a generation?ÿ not rediscovered by other scientists until 1899. Thus, the Mendelian model for explaining TayÿSachs was unavailable to scientists and doctors of the time. The first edition of the Jewish Encyclopedia, published in 12 volumes between 1901 and 1906, described what was then known about the disease:[44]\\r\\nIt is a curious fact that amaurotic family idiocy, a rare and fatal disease of children, occurs mostly among Jews. The largest number of cases has been observed in the United Statesover thirty in number. It was at first thought that this was an exclusively Jewish disease because most of the cases at first reported were between Russian and Polish Jews; but recently there have been reported cases occurring in non-Jewish children. The chief characteristics of the disease are progressive mental and physical enfeeblement; weakness and paralysis of all the extremities; and marasmus, associated with symmetrical changes in the macula lutea. On investigation of the reported cases, they found that neither consanguinity nor syphilitic, alcoholic, or nervous antecedents in the family history are factors in the etiology of the disease. No preventive measures have as yet been discovered, and no treatment has been of benefit, all the cases having terminated fatally.\\r\\nJewish immigration to the United States peaked in the period 1880ÿ1924, with the immigrants arriving from Russia and countries in Eastern Europe; this was also a period of nativism (hostility to immigrants) in the United States. Opponents of immigration often questioned whether immigrants from southern and eastern Europe could be assimilated into American society. Reports of TayÿSachs disease contributed to a perception among nativists that Jews were an inferior race.[43]\\r\\nIn 1969, Shintaro Okada and John S. O'Brien showed that TayÿSachs disease was caused by an enzyme defect; he also proved that TayÿSachs patients could be diagnosed by an assay of hexosaminidase?A activity.[45] The further development of enzyme assays demonstrated that levels of hexosaminidases A and B could be measured in patients and carriers, allowing the reliable detection of heterozygotes. During the early 1970s, researchers developed protocols for newborn testing, carrier screening, and pre-natal diagnosis.[30][46] By the end of 1979, researchers had identified three variant forms of GM2 gangliosidosis, including Sandhoff disease and the AB variant of GM2-gangliosidosis, accounting for false negatives in carrier testing.[47]\\r\\nSince carrier testing for TayÿSachs began in 1971, millions of Ashkenazi Jews have been screened as carriers. Jewish communities embraced the cause of genetic screening from the 1970s on. The success with TayÿSachs disease has led Israel to become the first country that offers free genetic screening and counseling for all couples and opened discussions about the proper scope of genetic testing for other disorders in Israel.[48]\\r\\nBecause TayÿSachs disease was one of the first autosomal recessive genetic disorders for which there was an enzyme assay test (prior to polymerase chain reaction testing methods), it was intensely studied as a model for all such diseases, and researchers sought evidence of a selective process. A continuing controversy is whether heterozygotes (carriers) have or had a selective advantage. The presence of four different lysosomal storage disorders in the Ashkenazi Jewish population suggests a past selective advantage for heterozygous carriers of these conditions.\\"[39]\\r\\nThis controversy among researchers has reflected three debates among geneticists at large:\\r\\nEnzyme replacement therapy techniques have been investigated for lysosomal storage disorders, and could potentially be used to treat TayÿSachs as well. The goal would be to replace the nonfunctional enzyme, a process similar to insulin injections for diabetes. However, in previous studies, the HEXA enzyme itself has been thought to be too large to pass through the specialized cell layer in the blood vessels that forms the bloodÿbrain barrier in humans.\\r\\nResearchers have also tried directly instilling the deficient enzyme hexosaminidase?A into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which bathes the brain. However, intracerebral neurons seem unable to take up this physically large molecule efficiently even when it is directly by them. Therefore, this approach to treatment of TayÿSachs disease has also been ineffective so far.[50]\\r\\nTayÿSachs disease exists in Jacob sheep.[51] The biochemical mechanism for this disease in the Jacob sheep is virtually identical to that in humans, wherein diminished activity of hexosaminidase?A results in increased concentrations of GM2 ganglioside in the affected animal.[52] Sequencing of the HEXA gene cDNA of affected Jacobs sheep reveal an identical number of nucleotides and exons as in the human HEXA gene, and 86% nucleotide sequence identity.[51] A missense mutation (G444R)[53] was found in the HEXA cDNA of the affected sheep. This mutation is a single nucleotide change at the end of exon 11, resulting in that exon's deletion (before translation) via splicing. The TayÿSachs model provided by the Jacob sheep is the first to offer promise as a means for gene therapy clinical trials, which may prove useful for disease treatment in humans.[51]\\r\\nOther experimental methods being researched involve substrate reduction therapy, which attempts to use alternative enzymes to increase the brain's catabolism of GM2 gangliosides to a point where residual degradative activity is sufficient to prevent substrate accumulation.[54][55] One experiment has demonstrated that using the enzyme sialidase allows the genetic defect to be effectively bypassed, and as a consequence, GM2 gangliosides are metabolized so that their levels become almost inconsequential. If a safe pharmacological treatment can be developed?ÿ one that increases expression of lysosomal sialidase in neurons without other toxicity?ÿ then this new form of therapy could essentially cure the disease.[56]\\r\\nAnother metabolic therapy under investigation for TayÿSachs disease uses miglustat.[57] This drug is a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyzes the first step in synthesizing glucose-based glycosphingolipids like GM2 ganglioside.[58]\\r\\nAs TayÿSachs disease is a deficiency of -hexosaminidase A, by getting a substance that increases its activity, people affected will not be deteriorating as fast or not at all. While for infantile TayÿSachs disease, there is no -hexosaminidase A so then the treatment would be ineffective. However, for people affected by Late-Onset TayÿSachs disease, they still have -hexosaminidase A. The drug Pyrimethamine has been shown to increase activity of -hexosaminidase A.[59] However, the increased levels of -hexosaminidase A still fall far short of the desired \\"10% of normal HEXA\\", above which the phenotypic symptoms begin to disappear.[59]\\r\\nThis is a harsh procedure, which involves killing the patient's blood system with chemo and administering cord blood. This procedure has been done before, with several people surviving the infantile form, to age 8 and on. Cord blood is immature, so it easily accepts its new host without rejecting it. As to date, the two hospitals that do this procedure are the University of Minnesota and Duke Medical Center.[60]\\r\\nCritics criticize its harsh nature, and that it is unapproved. It is also hard for it to cross the blood-brain barrier. The earlier treatment starts, the better. It is often very pricey, with $25000 per unit. Adults will need many units of cord blood.[61][60]","field3":"What type of genetic disorder is tay sachs?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"guarantees basic rights of private sector employees to organize into trade unions, engage in collective bargaining for better terms and conditions at work, and take collective action including strike if necessary","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (49 Stat. 449) 29 U.S.C.??151ÿ169 (also known as the Wagner Act after New York Senator Robert F. Wagner[1]) is a foundational statute of United States labor law which guarantees basic rights of private sector employees to organize into trade unions, engage in collective bargaining for better terms and conditions at work, and take collective action including strike if necessary. The act also created the National Labor Relations Board, which conducts elections that can expect employers to engage in collective bargaining with labor unions (also known as trade unions). The Act does not apply to workers who are covered by the Railway Labor Act, agricultural employees, domestic employees, supervisors, federal, state or local government workers, independent contractors and some close relatives of individual employers.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt signed the legislation into law on July 5, 1935.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also has its roots in a variety of different labor acts previously enacted:[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder section 1 (29 U.S.C.??151) of the Act, the key principles and policy findings on which the Act was based are explained. The Act aims to correct the \\"inequality of bargaining power between employees who, according to the Act's proponents, do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association\\". To achieve this, the central idea is the promotion of collective bargaining between independent trade unions, on behalf of the workforce, and the employer.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nencouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious definitions are explained in section 2, (29 U.S.C.??152) including 2(5) defining \\"labor organization\\" and 2(9) defining \\"labor dispute\\". The Act aims to protect employees as a group, and so is not based on a formal or legal relationship between an employer and employee.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which was established in NLRA 1935 sections 3 to 6 (29 U.S.C.??153ÿ156), is the primary enforcer of the Act. Employees and unions may act themselves in support of their rights, however because of collective action problems and the costs of litigation, the National Labor Relations Board is designed to assist and bear some of the costs. Under section 3, (29 U.S.C.??153) the NLRB has two basic functions: overseeing the process by which employees decide whether to be represented by a labor organization and prosecuting violations. Those processes are initiated in the regional offices of the NLRB.[6] The General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board give legal advice. Sections 4 (29 U.S.C.??154) and 5 (29 U.S.C.??155) set out provisions on the officers of the Board and their expenses. Section 6 (29 U.S.C.??156) empowers the Board to issue rules interpreting the labor legislation. This will generally be binding, unless a court deems it to have acted outside its authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder section 10 (29 U.S.C.??160) the NLRB is empowered to prevent unfair labor practices, which may ultimately be reviewed by the courts. Under section 11 it can lead investigations, collect evidence, issue subpoenas, and require witnesses to give evidence. Under section 12 (29 U.S.C.??162) it is an offense for people to unduly interfere with the Board's conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 7 (29 U.S.C.??157) sets out the general principle that employees have the right to join a trade union and engage in collective bargaining.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmployees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 8(a)(3).\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecific rules in support of collective bargaining are as follows.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Labor Relations Act of 1935 7\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder section 8 (29 U.S.C.??158) the law defines a set of prohibited actions by employers, employees, and unions, known as an unfair labor practice.[10] The first five unfair labor practices aimed at employers are in section 8(a). These are,\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, added by the TaftÿHartley Act, there are seven unfair labor practices aimed at unions and employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder section 9 (29 U.S.C.??159) the people elected by a majority of the workforce have the right to become the exclusive representatives of workers in collective bargaining with the employer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NLRA 1935 does not cover two main groups of employees: those working for the government, and in the railway or airline industries. Section 2(2) (29 USC 152(2)) states that the Act does not apply to employees of the \\"United States or any wholly owned Government corporation, or any Federal Reserve Bank, or any State or political subdivision thereof, or any person subject to the Railway Labor Act\\". Under section 19 (29 U.S.C.??169), people who have religious convictions against joining a trade union are entitled to not associate or financially support it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also excludes domestic workers and farm workers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Social Security Act of 1935 excluded from coverage about half the workers in the American economy. Among the excluded groups were agricultural and domestic workersa large percentage of whom were African Americans.[11]\\r\\nWagner Act 1935 13\\r\\n\\r\\nThe act was bitterly opposed by the Republican Party and business groups. The American Liberty League viewed the act as a threat to freedom and engaged in a campaign of opposition in order to repeal these \\"socialist\\" efforts. This included encouraging employers to refuse to comply with the NLRB and supporting the nationwide filing of injunctions to keep the NLRB from functioning. This campaign continued until the NLRA was found constitutional by the Supreme Court in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation (1937).\\r\\n\\r\\nLabor groups, while overwhelmingly supportive, expressed a set of reservations. The American Federation of Labor and some employers accused the NLRB of favoring the Congress of Industrial Organizations, particularly when determining whether to hold union elections in plant-wide, or wall-to-wall, units, which the CIO usually sought, or to hold separate elections in separate craft units, which the craft unions in the AFL favored. While the NLRB initially favored plant-wide units, which tacitly favored the CIO's industrial unionism, it retreated to a compromise position several years later under pressure from Congress that allowed craft unions to seek separate representation of smaller groups of workers at the same time that another union was seeking a wall-to-wall unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmployers and their allies in Congress also criticized the NLRA for its expansive definition of \\"employee\\" and for allowing supervisors and plant guards to form unions, sometimes affiliated with the unions that represented the employees whom they were supposed to supervise or police. Many accused the NLRB of a general pro-union and anti-employer bias, pointing to the Board's controversial decisions in such areas as employer free speech and \\"mixed motive\\" cases, in which the NLRB held that an employer violated the Act by using misconduct that ordinarily would not result in termination to fire an employee who was engaged in pro-union activity. In addition, employers campaigned over the years to outlaw a number of union practices such as closed shops, secondary boycotts, jurisdictional strikes, mass picketing, strikes in violation of contractual no-strike clauses, pension and health and welfare plans sponsored by unions and multi-employer bargaining.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of these criticisms included provisions that employers and their allies were unable to have included in the NLRA. Others developed in reaction to NLRB decisions. Over all, they wanted the NLRB to be neutral as to bargaining power, but the NLRA's policy section takes a decidedly pro-employee position:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is declared to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.\\r\\nSome of these changes were later achieved in the 1947 amendments.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpponents of the Wagner Act introduced several hundred bills to amend or repeal the law in the decade after its passage. All of them failed or were vetoed until the passage of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, or the TaftÿHartley Act, in 1947.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recent unsuccessful efforts included attempts in 1978 to permit triple backpay awards and union collective bargaining certification based on signed union authorization cards, a provision that is similar to one of the proposed amendments in the Employee Free Choice Act. Under the NLRA, unions can become the representative based on signed union authorization cards only if the employer voluntarily recognizes the union. If the employer refuses to recognize the union, the union can be certified through a secret-ballot election conducted by the NLRB.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Little Wagner Act, written by Ida Klaus, is the New York City version of the Wagner Act.[12][13]","field3":"What was the purpose of the wagner act?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"July 20, 1871","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"","field3":"When did british columbia became a province of canada?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"a market-capitalization-weighted index of the market value of all stocks actively traded in the United States","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index, or more simply the Wilshire 5000, is a market-capitalization-weighted index of the market value of all stocks actively traded in the United States.

The resort was built by developer Steve Wynn and is currently owned and operated by MGM Resorts International.\\r\\nThe original marquee sign in front of the Mirage is the largest free standing marquee in the world. The resort is connected by a free tram to the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino neighboring the hotel's property to the north.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mirage was built by developer Steve Wynn and designed by Joel Bergman[citation needed] and Roger Thomas.[1] It was built on the site formerly occupied by the Castaways and prior to that, the Red Rooster Nite Club.\\r\\nThe Mirage was proposed with an initial cost of $565 million.[2] Financier Michael Milken helped finance the project by selling $525 million worth of mortgage bonds.[3] The Mirage was the first resort that was built with the money of Wall Street through the use of junk bonds.[citation needed] The project went over budget,[2] and was the most expensive hotel-casino in history, with a construction cost of US $630 million.[4] The hotel's distinctive gold windows get their color from actual gold dust used in the tinting process.\\r\\nThe Mirage's construction is considered noteworthy in that Wynn had set a new standard for Vegas resorts, and is widely considered to be the father of today's Las Vegas. Prior to The Mirage's opening, the city was experiencing a decline in tourism that began in the 1970s, especially around the time that the state of New Jersey legalized gambling and tourists (in particular those on the East Coast) began to frequent the casinos of Atlantic City. Also, this was a time when Las Vegas was no longer considered a fashionable destination, so a new, high-profile, project was necessary to jump-start the ailing industry.[2] Wynn planned for the resort to feature boxing matches to compete against the Las Vegas Hilton and the adjacent Caesars Palace.[5]\\r\\nWynn initially considered naming the resort the Golden Nugget,[2] after his Golden Nugget hotel-casino in downtown Las Vegas. However, Wynn and others involved with the new resort knew that it would need a different name; otherwise, they believed that the two properties would become known as \\"the old one\\" and \\"the new one.\\" Wynn chose \\"The Mirage\\" because of the resort's South Pacific theme. In 1988, to avoid confusion, Wynn purchased the rights to the Mirage name from two other businesses, the La Mirage Casino and the Mirage Motel. Both businesses received $250,000 to change their names.[5][2]\\r\\nThe Mirage, initially scheduled for an opening in early December 1989,[5] was opened early on November 22, 1989.[2] At the time of its opening, The Mirage was the largest hotel in the world, with 3,044 rooms. The hotel tower, standing 29 stories, was built out in a Y-shape design, a concept that was later copied by Las Vegas' Treasure Island, Monte Carlo, and Mandalay Bay resorts. The hotel's top five floors were used exclusively for high roller rooms and penthouse suites. The Mirage was the first new resort to be built on the Las Vegas Strip in 16 years,[3] after the completion of the MGM Grand in 1973.[2] When it opened, The Mirage was the first casino to use security cameras full-time on all table games.[6]\\r\\nStarting in February 1990, The Mirage was the venue for the Siegfried & Roy show, held in the resort's 1,500-seat showroom.[3] The two headliners combined magic and the use of wild animals. The show closed in 2003 after performer Roy Horn was bitten and injured by one of the white tigers used in the show.\\r\\nIn 1993, The Mirage hosted an extended run of the Cirque du Soleil show Nouvelle Exprience in a tent in The Mirage parking lot. It was during this time that Steve Wynn decided to invite Cirque to create Mystre for the soon-to-be-built Treasure Island resort next door. Finally returning to where they began in Las Vegas, Cirque du Soleil has a permanent production at The Mirage, LOVE.[7]\\r\\nAs of 1999, The Mirage had 6,000 employees. At that time, Wynn was investing $100 million into the resort to build two theaters and to add 130,000?sq?ft (12,000?m2) of convention space. On March 7, 2000, MGM Grand Inc. acquired Wynn's company, Mirage Resorts, for $4.4 billion.[8]\\r\\nIn March 2000, Danny Gans started performing at the resort. Prior to that time, Gans performed at the Rio Hotel and Casino.[2] Gans took over the marquee in 2004, becoming the resort's main entertainment attraction. In December 2006, the Beatles-themed REVOLUTION ultra-lounge opened. It was the first time Cirque du Soleil was involved in the development of a nightlife venue, operated by The Light Group.\\r\\nGans left The Mirage in February 2009 to star in a show at the Encore Las Vegas.[9] In 2009, ventriloquist and 2007 America's Got Talent winner Terry Fator began a 5-year run at the hotel.[citation needed] Also in 2009, The Mirage was featured on The Amazing Race 15, where one team member had to bungee the other into the air to grab a bouquet of flowers presented in the Love theater.\\r\\nIn November 2012 The Mirage casino became the second Las Vegas casino to offer Geoff Hall's Blackjack variant Free Bet Blackjack, after the Golden Nugget Casino.[10] In 2014, The Mirage was featured in The Amazing Race 24, where teams had to replace the lightbulbs in the letter 'I' in 'Mirage'.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2015 MGM Resorts International announced that it would place the Mirage and other properties into a real estate investment trust.

Golden Retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water. Golden Retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments. Although they need substantial outdoor exercise, they should be housed in a fenced area because of their instinctual tendency to roam.[4] They shed copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and require fairly regular grooming.\\r\\nThe breed is a prominent participant in conformation shows for purebred dogs. The Golden Retriever is popular as a disability assistance dog such as being a guide dog for the blind and a hearing dog for the deaf. In addition, they are trained to be a hunting dog, a detection dog, and a search and rescue participant. The breed's friendly, gentle temperament means it is unsuited to being a professional guard dog, but its temperament has also made it the third-most popular family dog breed (by registration) in the United States,[5] the fifth-most popular in Brazil[6] and Australia,[7] and the eighth-most popular in the United Kingdom.[8] Golden Retrievers are rarely choosy eaters, but require ample exercise (of two or more hours a day).[9] The breed is fond of play but also highly trainable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Golden Retriever is a large, strongly built breed with a dense, water-repellant wavy coat.[10] As a dog with origins in pedigree breeding, and due to its widespread historical popularity, some regional variations have emerged in the breed; therefore, the three subtypes of the Golden Retriever reflect the typical variations in dimensions and coat. However, all Golden Retrievers are blonde, yellow, or gold in colour and all subtypes are susceptible to the same health problems.[11]\\r\\nBritish-type Golden Retrievers are prevalent throughout Europe and Australia.[12] The skull is broader and the forequarters are more muscular than in other types. The muzzle is balanced and well chiseled. The coat is generally lighter in color than in the American types. Males stand between 22 to 24?in (56 to 61?cm) at the withers; females are between 20 to 22?in (51 to 56?cm). Acceptable or expected weights are not specified in the UK standard, but the Kennel Club standard calls for a level topline and straight hindquarters without the slight rear angulation found in American lines.[13][14]\\r\\nThe eyes are round and dark, which is in contrast to the triangular or slanted composition of their American counterparts. British Golden Retrievers can have a coat colour of any shade of gold or cream; red or mahogany are not permitted. Originally, cream was an unacceptable colour in the UK standard, but the standard was revised in 1936 to include cream. At the time of this revision, the exclusion of cream as a colour was agreed to as a mistake, as the original \\"yellow\\" retrievers of the 19th century were actually lighter in colour than was permitted by the standards used before 1936. As with American lines, white is an unacceptable colour in the show ring.[15] The British Kennel Club standard is used in all countries except the USA and Canada.[14] Golden Retrievers have muscular bodies with great endurance, owing to their origins as hunting and gundogs.\\r\\nAmerican types are lankier and less muscular than other types, males stand between 23 and 24?in (58 and 61?cm) in height at the withers; females are 21.5 to 22.5?in (55 to 57?cm) tall. Their coats are darker in color and occur in various shades of lustrous gold with moderate feathering. When trotting, they have a free, smooth, powerful, and well-coordinated gait; as the dog runs, its feet converge towards the center of the line of balance.[16] The American standard also makes requirements about the proportion, substance, head and skull, neck, body, topline, forequarters, and hindquarters; in these respects, the American-type Retriever is the same as Golden Retrievers that conform to other national standards. American breeders of Golden Retrievers sometimes import their dogs from Britain to take advantage of the temperament and appearance of the British types.\\r\\nThe Canadian Golden Retriever has a thinner and darker coat and stands taller than other types. Males stand 23 and 24?in (58 and 61?cm) in height at withers; and females 21.5 to 22.5?in (55 to 57?cm). Weight for males is between 29ÿ34?kg (65-75?lb); and females between 27ÿ32?kg (60-70?lb).[17]\\r\\nAs indicated by their name, their coats occur in light golden to dark golden colours. The topcoat is water-resistant and slightly wavy, and sheds in small amounts throughout the year. The undercoat is soft and keeps the retriever cool in summer and warm in winter; it sheds in the spring and fall.[18] It usually lies flat against the belly. The Golden's coat should never be too long, as this may prove to be a disservice to it in the field, especially when retrieving game.[19] Golden Retrievers have mild feathering on the backs of their fore legs and heavier feathering on the fronts of their necks, backs of their thighs and the bottoms of their tails.[4]\\r\\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) standard states the coat is a \\"rich, lustrous golden of various shades\\", disallowing extremely light or extremely dark coats. This leaves the outer ranges of coat colour up to a judge's discretion when competing in conformation shows. Therefore, \\"pure white\\" and \\"red\\" are unacceptable, as is black.[15] The Kennel Club (UK) also permits cream as an acceptable coat colour.[13] Judges may also disallow Goldens with pink noses, or those lacking pigment. The Golden's coat can also be mahogany, referred to as \\"redhead\\", although this is not accepted in the British show ring.[13] As a Golden grows older, its coat can become darker or lighter, along with a noticeable whitening of the fur on and around the muzzle. Puppy coats are usually much lighter than their adult coats, but a puppy with darker ear tips may indicate a darker adult color.\\r\\nGolden Retrievers vary in colour, with a fair-haired dog shown here beside a mahogany one\\r\\nThe coat is \\"rich, lustrous golden of various shades\\"\\r\\nA four-month-old white golden retriever\\r\\nA light golden puppy\\r\\nA dark golden coat\\r\\nGolden Retrievers (left) are often confused with yellow Labs (right). One key difference is the much shorter hair of the yellow Lab.\\r\\nThe temperament of the Golden Retriever is a hallmark of the breed, and is described in the standard as \\"kindly, friendly and confident\\".[13] Golden Retrievers make good family pets, particularly as they are patient with children.[4] They are not \\"one-man dogs\\" and are generally equally amiable with both strangers and those familiar to them.[21] Their trusting, gentle disposition makes them a poor guard dog.[22] Any form of unprovoked aggression or hostility towards either people, dogs or other animals, whether in the show ring or community, is considered unacceptable in a Golden Retriever and is not in keeping with the character of the breed, nor should a Golden Retriever be unduly timid or nervous.[16][21] The typical Golden Retriever is calm, naturally intelligent and biddable, and with an exceptional eagerness to please.\\r\\nGolden Retrievers are also noted for their intelligence. The breed ranks fourth in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs ÿ following the Border Collie, Poodle, and German Shepherd ÿ?as one of the brightest dogs ranked by obedience-command trainability.\\r\\nTypical Golden Retrievers are active and fun-loving animals with the exceptionally patient demeanour befitting a dog bred to sit quietly for hours in a hunting blind. Adult Goldens love to work, and have a keen ability to focus on a given task. They will work until they collapse, so care should be taken to avoid overworking them.\\r\\nOther characteristics related to their hunting heritage are a size suited for scrambling in and out of boats and an inordinate love for water. Golden Retrievers are exceptionally trainabledue to their intelligence, athleticism and desire to please their handlersand excel in obedience trials. They are also very competitive in agility and other performance events. Harsh training methods are unnecessary, as Golden Retrievers often respond very well to positive and upbeat training styles.[23]\\r\\nGolden Retrievers are compatible with other dogs, cats, and most livestock. They are particularly valued for their high level of sociability towards people, calmness, and willingness to learn. Because of this, they are commonly used as guide dogs, mobility assistance dogs, and search and rescue dogs.\\r\\nThe average lifespan for a Golden Retriever is about 11 to 12 years.[26][27][28] They are susceptible to specific ailments, so should be taken to a veterinarian for yearly checkups.\\r\\nGolden Retrievers are known to have genetic disorders and other diseases. Hip dysplasia is common in the breed; when buying a puppy, the pedigree should be known and be examined by the OFA or by PennHIP for hip disease. Obesity is also common in the breed because Golden Retrievers love to eat. Puppies should eat about three cups of food a day and adults three to five cups, depending on the food and how active the dog is.[18]\\r\\nCancer, the most common being hemangiosarcoma, followed by lymphosarcoma, mast cell tumour, and osteosarcoma, was the cause of death for 61.4% of American Goldens according to a 1998 health study conducted by the Golden Retriever Club of America, making it the breed's biggest killer.[26] A 2004 survey by the UK Kennel Club puts this number at 38.8%.[27] Although most puppies are screened for the disorders before being sold (by reputable breeders), hip and elbow dysplasia afflict one-fifth of dogs.[29][30] Eye diseases are also possible in the breed; cataracts are the most common eye disease,[29] but they can also be afflicted with progressive retinal atrophy, glaucoma, distichiasis,[31] entropion,[31] corneal dystrophy,[31] and retinal dysplasia.[31]\\r\\nThey may suffer from heart disease, especially subvalvular aortic stenosis,[29] and cardiomyopathy and joint diseases, including patella luxation, osteochondritis, panosteitis, and cruciate ligament rupture. In addition to the heavy shedding they experience (and their constant lighter shedding throughout the year), Golden Retrievers can suffer from skin diseases; the most prevalent skin problem is allergies (often leading to acute moist dermatitis or \\"hot spots\\"), with the most common allergy being to fleas.[26] They can also suffer from seborrhoea, sebaceous adenitis, self-inflicted lick granuloma, and haemophilia.[32]\\r\\nGolden Retrievers require regular grooming and occasional baths.[4] Their coats shed somewhat during the year, but are known to shed profusely twice a year. They also need to have their ears cleaned regularly, or ear infections might occur. While shedding is unavoidable, frequent grooming (daily to weekly) lessens the amount of hair shed by the animal. Severe shedding resulting in bald patches can be indicative of stress or sickness.\\r\\nThe Golden Retriever's eagerness to please has made it a consistent, top performer in the obedience and agility rings. Its excellent swimming ability makes it proficient at dock jumping. A natural retrieving ability means it is also competitive in flyball and field trials.[33]\\r\\nThe first three dogs ever to achieve the AKC Obedience Champion title were Golden Retrievers; the first of the three was a female named 'Ch. Moreland's Golden Tonka'.[34]\\r\\nSince Golden Retrievers are so trainable, they are used for many important jobs, such as guide dogs for blind people, drug or bomb sniffing at airports, or helping to rescuing people from earthquakes and other natural disasters.[18] This breed is also used in water rescue/lifesaving, along with the Leonberger, Newfoundland and Labrador Retriever dogs.[35]\\r\\nThe Golden Retriever was originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century.[3][33] At that time, wildfowl hunting was a popular sport for the wealthy Scottish elite, but the existing retriever breeds were inadequate for retrieving downed game from both water and land. Retrieving from both land and water was necessary because the hunting grounds of the time were pocketed with marshy ponds and rivers. Consequently, the best water spaniels were crossed with the existing retrievers, resulting in the establishment of the breed today known as the Golden Retriever.[36] The Golden Retriever was first developed near Glen Affric in Scotland, at \\"Guisachan\\", the highland estate of Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth.[37] For many years, what breeds were originally crossed was disputed, but in 1952, the publication of Marjoribanks' breeding records from 1835 to 1890 dispelled the myth concerning the purchase of a whole troupe of Russian tracker sheepdogs from a visiting circus, instead it details a careful line-breeding program.[33] Commonly, the breed is said to have originated from the Russian tracker.[38][39]\\r\\nImprovements in guns during the 1800s resulted in more fowl being downed during hunts at greater distances and over increasingly difficult terrain, leading to more birds being lost in the field. Because of this improvement in firearms, a need for a specialist retriever arose, as training setter and pointer breeds in retrievals was found to be ineffective. Thus, work began on the breeding of the dog to fill this much-needed role.[21]\\r\\nThe original cross was of a yellow-coloured retriever, 'Nous', with a Tweed Water Spaniel female dog, 'Belle'.[40] The Tweed Water Spaniel is now extinct, but was then common in the border country. Marjoribanks had purchased Nous in 1865 from an unregistered litter of otherwise black wavy-coated retriever pups. In 1868, this cross produced a litter that included four pups; these four became the basis of a breeding program which included the Irish Setter, the sandy-coloured Bloodhound, the St. John's water dog of Newfoundland, and two more wavy-coated black retrievers. The bloodline was also inbred and selected for trueness to Marjoribanks' idea of the ultimate hunting dog. His vision included a more vigorous and powerful dog than previous retrievers, one that would still be gentle and trainable. Russian sheepdogs are not mentioned in these records, nor are any other working dog breeds. The ancestry of the Golden Retriever is all sporting dogs, in line with Marjoribanks' goals. The Golden Retriever was active and powerful and had a gentle mouth for retrieving games while on hunts.[4]\\r\\nOrganisations other than clubs are dedicated to Golden Retrievers, such as breed-specific adoption sites. One such organisation is the Golden Retriever Club of Scotland, which in August 2013 assembled 222 Golden Retrievers at the historical home of the first Golden Retrievers.[41]\\r\\nGolden Retrievers were first accepted for registration by The Kennel Club of England in 1903, as Flat Coats ÿ Golden. They were first exhibited in 1908, and in 1911 were recognized as a breed referred to as Retriever (Golden and Yellow).\\r\\nIt took another 14 years for the breed to be recognized in America, and in 1925, the American Kennel Club did so. In 1938, the Golden Retriever Club of America was founded. Golden Retrievers are ranked number two for American Kennel Club Registrations. As of the year 1999, 62,652 have been registered and the only breed above them is the Labrador Retriever.[42] According to the purebred dog guide recognized by the American Kennel Club, Golden Retrievers are judged based on a variety of traits: color, coat, ears, feet, nose, body, etc.[43]\\r\\nThe Honourable Archie Marjoribanks took a Golden Retriever to Canada in 1881, and registered 'Lady' with the AKC in 1894. These are the first records of the breed in these two countries. The breed was first registered in Canada in 1927, and the Golden Retriever Club of Ontario (GRCO) was formed in 1958. The cofounders of the GRCO were Cliff Drysdale, an Englishman who had brought over an English Golden, and Jutta Baker, daughter-in-law of Louis Baker, who owned Northland Kennels.[44] The GCRO in later years expanded to become the Golden Retriever Club of Canada.\\r\\nIn July 2006, the Golden Retriever Club of Scotland organized a gathering of Golden Retriever enthusiasts at the ancestral home, Guisachan House. A photograph taken by photographer Lynn Kipps to commemorate the occasion captured 188 Golden Retrievers, and so holds the record for the most Golden Retrievers in one image.[45]\\r\\nLiberty, the presidential pet of President Gerald R. Ford,[46] and Victory, the presidential pet of Ronald Reagan,[47][48] were Golden Retrievers. The breed has also featured in a number of films and TV series, including the Air Bud film series, Full House, Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey and Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco, Fluke, Napoleon, Up, Pushing Daisies, You've Got Mail, The Drew Carey Show, and Cats & Dogs. Cash from The Fox and the Hound 2 was also a mix of this breed, as was Whopper from Pound Puppies.[citation needed]\\r\\nA female Golden Retriever named Goldie appeared on the UK BBC One children's programme Blue Peter from 1978 to 1986.[49] Monty Don, a presenter of the UK BBC Two gardening programme Gardeners' World has a male Golden Retriever called Nigel who appears with him most of the time on the programme.[50] A Golden Retriever portrayed the role of Levi, the hearing dog of the titular deaf FBI agent in Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye, based on the life of the real Sue Thomas.[citation needed]","field3":"How long do golden retrievers live on average?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"France","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place every four years, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to World War II. The most recent World Cup, hosted by Russia in 2018, was won by France, who beat Croatia 4ÿ2 in regulation time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Cup final match is the last of the competition, and the result determines which country is declared world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is then decided by a penalty shoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions.[1] The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except 1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2ÿ1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of the tournament) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 21 tournaments held, 79 nations have appeared at least once. Of these, 13 have made it to the final match, and eight have won.[n 1] With five titles, Brazil is the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have participated in every World Cup finals tournament.[4] Italy and Germany have four titles. Current champion France, along with past champions Uruguay and Argentina, have two titles each, while England and Spain have one each. The team that wins the finals receive the FIFA World Cup Trophy, and their name is engraved on the bottom side of the trophy.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1970 and 1994, along with the 1986, 1990 and 2014 games are to date the only matches competed by the same teams (BrazilÿItaly and ArgentinaÿGermany respectively). As of 2018, the 1934 final[n 2] remains the latest final to have been between two teams playing their first final. The final match of the most recent 2018 World Cup in Russia took place at the country's biggest sports complex, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.[6] The 1930 and the 1966 games are the only ones that did not take place on a Sunday. The former did on a Wednesday and the latter on a Saturday. As of 2018, only nations from Europe and South America have competed in a World Cup final.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecific","field3":"Who won last men's soccer world cup?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"874 miles","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nLand's End to John o' Groats is the traversal of the whole length of the island of Great Britain between two extremities, in the southwest and northeast.  The traditional distance by road is 874 miles (1,407?km) and takes most cyclists 10 to 14 days; the record for running the route is nine days. Off-road walkers typically walk about 1,200 miles (1,900?km) and take two or three months for the expedition.  Two much-photographed signposts indicate the traditional distance at each end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe straight-line distance from Land's End to John o' Groats is 603 miles (970?km) as determined from O.S. Grid References, but such a route passes over a series of stretches of water in the Irish Sea.  Google Earth reports a distance of 602.70 miles between the two iconic marker points.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a 1964 road atlas, the shortest route using classified roads was 847 miles (1,363?km) but in a 2008 road atlas, the shortest route using classified roads was 838 miles (1,349?km). An online route planner in 2011 also calculated the quickest route by road as 838 miles (1,349?km), estimating a time of 15 hours 48 minutes for the journey (this uses the A30, M5, M6, A74(M), M74, M73, M80, M9, A9 & A99) but the overall shortest route by road, using minor roads in numerous places and utilising modern bridges, is only about 814 miles (1,310?km).  This route is roughly as follows: Land's End, Bodmin, Okehampton, Tiverton, Taunton, Bridgwater, the M5 Avon Bridge, the M48 Severn Bridge, Monmouth, Hereford, Shrewsbury, Tarporley, St Helens, Preston, Carlisle, Beattock, Carstairs, Whitburn, Falkirk, Stirling, Crieff, Kenmore, Dalchalloch, A9, Inverness, Kessock Bridge, Cromarty Bridge, Dornoch Firth Bridge, Latheron, Wick, John o' Groats.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle Maps, on 2 August 2017, calculated the fastest route by car, from the Land's End Visitor Centre to John o' Groats as being 837 miles and taking 14 hours 40 minutes.  It also showed a walking route of 811 miles, which it suggested would take 268 hours, and involve an elevation gain of 30,148 ft and an elevation fall of 30,272 ft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many ways to go from Land's End to John o' Groats. Traditionally considered to be a walk, the route is now traversed in a number of ways, with cycling and multi-modal expeditions being particularly popular in recent years.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost trips are done by individuals or small groups for personal fulfilment. Some expeditions are organised as charity fundraisers, sometimes involving celebrities: examples include cricketer Ian Botham's 1985 walk and athlete Jane Tomlinson in 2003. In recent history the route has been used as a rite of passage by cyclists taking on the most iconic cycling challenge in Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded end-to-end walk (actually from John o' Groats to Land's End) was undertaken by the brothers John and Robert Naylor in 1871.[4]  Since then the walk has been undertaken many times, more particularly since 1960, after a well-publicised road walk by Dr Barbara Moore.  In 1960 the entrepreneur Billy Butlin organised a road walking race, which gave further impetus to the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1960s, walkers have mostly chosen off-road routes, using the growing network of long-distance footpaths.  A classic account is from 1966 by the travel writer John Hillaby.[5] Off-road walkers usually complete the journey in two to three months. There is a considerable choice of off-road routes, but all are much longer than the shortest road distance, usually 1,200 miles (1,900?km) or more.  The walk is still undertaken by road walkers, often doing the walk, like Sir Ian Botham, for charity, or as a \\"challenge walk\\".  They typically take a month or even less.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome walkers aim to complete the route piecemeal, perhaps over several years, to achieve the walk within the time constraints of a working life and before the possible health problems of retirement.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no continuous long-distance path from Land's End to John o' Groats.  There are long-distance paths for substantial sections of the route, and where they do not exist walkers connect them by rights of way and minor roads. Most walkers broadly follow these routes:[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several annual mass participation cycle rides that go from Land's End to John o' Groats, the biggest of which is the Deloitte Ride Across Britain,[8] run by Threshold Sports. The Ride Across Britain takes over 800 riders the full length of Britain, taking nine days and covering 969 miles (1,559?km), with each rider covering an average of 107 miles (172?km) per day. Overnight accommodation is provided in large, tented base camps, and all aspects of the ride are fully supported. Previous celebrity participants include GB rower and Olympic gold medallist James Cracknell and former England Rugby captain Lewis Moody.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official Road Records Association record for a rider on a conventional bicycle is 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds, set by 40 year old Michael Broadwith on 17 June 2018.[9] Michael is a maths teacher who lives in the south of England. He studied mathematics at St Edmund Hall, Oxford University, representing the university in the reserves boat race in 2000. He won the UK national 24 hour cycling road race (Mersey roads) in 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the lead up to his record breaking ride. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe record for cycling from Land's End to John o' Groats is held by Andy Wilkinson, who completed the journey in 41 hours, 4 minutes and 22 seconds on a Windcheetah recumbent tricycle.[10] A typical cycling time when not attempting shortest time is 10 to 14 days. James MacDonald set a record in September 2017 for cycling from John o' Groats to Land's End and back again in five days, 18 hours and 3 minutes.[11] From 1 to 4 March 2010, David Walliams, Jimmy Carr, Fearne Cotton, Miranda Hart, Patrick Kielty, Davina McCall and Russell Howard cycled in a team relay from John o' Groats to Land's End to raise money for Sport Relief.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nMen's tandem bicycle. 5ÿ7 May 2015 Riders: Dominic Irvine and Charlie Mitchell.

He completed the run in just over 17 days.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nFred Hicks was an early record holder. He ran the journey between the 20th and 30th of May, 1977 in 10 days 3 hours and 30 minutes. He ran this for charity, not aiming to set any records, and it was only later, when he was approached by the Road Running association asking if they could pursue the record with Guinness, that he became aware he had set a new record.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 July 2009 British ultramarathon runner Kevin Carr successfully completed the first ever attempt to run the route off-road, becoming the first athlete to run the length of the UK as a fell/trail run. Like Driver, Carr ran unsupported and soloa format commonly known amongst fell runners as a mountain marathon. Carr ran the challenge as part of an event organised by Benumber1, an event that saw several top-level British athletes (mainly Olympians) completing the challenge. The event was designed to encourage school students to participate in sport and to realise the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, whilst raising funds for the British Heart Foundation. The run covered 1,254 miles (2,018?km) over footpaths, bridleways, canal paths, river banks, national trails, fields, moorland and mountains. Over 80% of the route was off-road, the route resorting to tarmac only when necessary to link two trails, or where a trail passed through a village/town. The run took 6 weeks 3 days and 17 hours (including three rest days). Factoring in the rest days, this run called for an average effort of just under 30 miles (50?km) a day, every day, for more than six weeks.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2011, a team of runners from Calday Grange Grammar School, Wirral completed a relay from Land's End to John o' Groats, becoming the first school to do so.[23] They raised S200,000[24] for Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mid summer of 2011 Anthony Band from Surrey ran 1000 miles barefoot, all in aid for Help for heroes. Band took 29 days, running on average 36 miles per day.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 August 2014, Marie-Claire Oziem became the first female runner to complete the distance unsupported and solo.[25] She pushed all her provisions in a pram and camped along the way. Her route consisted of both on and off-road sections. Oziem ran for the charity Mind, based in Taunton for its project Go Wild, Stay Well, which aims to support those with mental illness through the use of various green therapy schemes. She started her run on 23 June and finished on 3 August 2014, regularly running distances of over 32 miles daily.[better?source?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey with a horse is generally completed north to south, starting in April to avoid the midges in the Highlands but also to benefit from warmer weather.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvelyn Burnaby was the younger brother of the famous English Long Rider Colonel Frederick Burnaby. Whereas the elder brother was famous for having ridden across Central Asia and the Ottoman Empire, Evelyn decided to keep his equestrian adventures closer to home. He set off in 1892 to ride from Lands End, Cornwall to John o Groats, Scotland. Evelyns journey was soon serialised in a popular publication, The Country Gentleman, and was published in book form the following year as A Ride from Land's End to John O' Groats.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunist John Richard Penistan rode his horse, Billy-a-Journey from Lands End to John o Groats in 1948 (or 1930[27]) taking him 56 days.

In 1911, Ivan B. Hart-Davies became the holder of the final Land's End to John o' Groats record for solo motorcycles. Riding his 3.5?hp single-speed Triumph, he covered the 886 miles (1,426?km) in 29 hours, 12 minutes. As his average speed exceeded the then-maximum of 20?mph, further official record attempts were banned by the A. C. U.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Motor Cycling Club (which had been running the London to Land's End Trial since 1908, still held today, at least in name) put on an annual Land's End to John o' Groats Run from 1923 to 1928 which included cars as well as motorcycles.  These events were also known as the End to End. In 2006, BBC Television ran a series of three programmes called The Lost World of Friese-Greene covering Claude Friese-Greene's 1920s-era road trip from Land's End to John o' Groats.  The trip had originally been filmed using the Biocolour process, developed by Claude's father William Friese-Greene and the film had degraded. The original print of Claude's film was subjected to computer enhancement by the British Film Institute to remove the flickering problem inherent in the Biocolour process.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, Neal Champion covered 884 miles (1,423?km) from John o' Groats to Land's End in 11 hours, 14 minutes, on a Kawasaki GPZ750 Turbo.[33]\\r\\nin 1984, Christian Conzendorf-Mattner, covered the route from Land's End to John o' Groatsthere and back non-stop other than for fuelin 21 hours 22 mins in a 1941 BMW 327.\\r\\nThe record run was monitored by a team of journalists from a motoring magazine and is the current record for prewar classic cars end to end, non-stop, one driver.

The route takes a long 1,400-mile (2,300?km) route, using remote upland roads of the west of England, Wales (during the night), the Pennines and Scotland.  Medals are awarded in gold, silver and bronze categories.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 15ÿ16 April 1997, Hugh Edeleanu drove the route in a JCB excavator in a time of 22 hours, 10 minutes and 30 seconds.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2001, Wayne Booth became the first person to do the journey by motorcycle without stopping; the 37-year-old completed the historic trip in 14 hours and 52 minutes, averaging 57?mph, on a modified 1,000cc Honda Varedero, complete with additional 74-litre petrol tank. The meticulously researched route of 854 miles (1,374?km) passed through just two sets of traffic lights and was completed within all highway regulations, law and speed limits.[37][38] Booth and the dozen strong support team raised over S1,000 for The National Childbirth Trust and Macmillan Cancer Relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 22 May 2011, Kevin Sharpe and David Peilow completed the first end-to-end run from John o' Groats to Land's End in an electric car over two days, using only charging stations available to the general public, in a Tesla Roadster sports car.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 August 2011, Darren Whitehead & Tony Dwight travelled 1,071 miles (1,724?km) from John o' Groats to Land's End (including crossing the Welsh border) in 5 days using two ride-on Wheel Horse lawn mowers.[40] They also raised money for charity during the trip which was named The Lawn Way Down.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 November 2013, Lucy Grogan, travelling on a BMW GS R1200 motorbike, and her father Martin Grogan, travelling in a Mini Cooper Works, travelled from Land's End to John o' Groats in 19 hours, leaving Land's End at 4:30am and arriving at John o' Groats at 11:30pm same day.

Coral reefs are built by colonies of tiny animals found in marine water that contain few nutrients. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, which in turn consist of polyps that cluster in groups. The polyps belong to a group of animals known as Cnidaria, which also includes sea anemones and jellyfish. Unlike sea anemones, corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons which support and protect the coral polyps. Most reefs grow best in warm, shallow, clear, sunny and agitated water.\\r\\nOften called \\"rainforests of the sea\\", shallow coral reefs form some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They occupy less than 0.1% of the world's ocean surface, about half the area of France, yet they provide a home for at least 25% of all marine species,[1][2][3][4] including fish, mollusks, worms, crustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, tunicates and other cnidarians.[5] Paradoxically, coral reefs flourish even though they are surrounded by ocean waters that provide few nutrients. They are most commonly found at shallow depths in tropical waters, but deep water and cold water corals also exist on smaller scales in other areas.\\r\\nCoral reefs deliver ecosystem services to tourism, fisheries and shoreline protection. The annual global economic value of coral reefs is estimated between US$30ÿ375 billion.[6][7] However, coral reefs are fragile ecosystems, partly because they are very sensitive to water temperature. They are under threat from climate change, oceanic acidification, blast fishing, cyanide fishing for aquarium fish, sunscreen use,[8] overuse of reef resources, and harmful land-use practices, including urban and agricultural runoff and water pollution, which can harm reefs by encouraging excess algal growth.[9][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the coral reefs we can see today were formed after the last glacial period when melting ice caused the sea level to rise and flood the continental shelves. This means that most modern coral reefs are less than 10,000 years old. As communities established themselves on the shelves, the reefs grew upwards, pacing rising sea levels. Reefs that rose too slowly could become drowned reefs. They are covered by so much water that there was insufficient light.[12] Coral reefs are found in the deep sea away from continental shelves, around oceanic islands and as atolls. The vast majority of these islands are volcanic in origin. The few exceptions have tectonic origins where plate movements have lifted the deep ocean floor on the surface.\\r\\nIn 1842 in his first monograph, The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs,[13] Charles Darwin set out his theory of the formation of atoll reefs, an idea he conceived during the voyage of the Beagle. He theorized uplift and subsidence of the Earth's crust under the oceans formed the atolls.[14] Darwins theory sets out a sequence of three stages in atoll formation. It starts with a fringing reef forming around an extinct volcanic island as the island and ocean floor subsides. As the subsidence continues, the fringing reef becomes a barrier reef, and ultimately an atoll reef.\\r\\nDarwins theory starts with a volcanic island which becomes extinct\\r\\nAs the island and ocean floor subside, coral growth builds a fringing reef, often including a shallow lagoon between the land and the main reef.\\r\\nAs the subsidence continues, the fringing reef becomes a larger barrier reef further from the shore with a bigger and deeper lagoon inside.\\r\\nUltimately, the island sinks below the sea, and the barrier reef becomes an atoll enclosing an open lagoon.\\r\\nDarwin predicted that underneath each lagoon would be a bed rock base, the remains of the original volcano. Subsequent drilling proved this correct. Darwin's theory followed from his understanding that coral polyps thrive in the clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated, but can only live within a limited depth range, starting just below low tide. Where the level of the underlying earth allows, the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs, and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef.\\r\\nWhere the bottom is rising, fringing reefs can grow around the coast, but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone. If the land subsides slowly, the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of older, dead coral, forming a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land. A barrier reef can encircle an island, and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues to keep up with the sea level, forming a central lagoon. Barrier reefs and atolls do not usually form complete circles, but are broken in places by storms. Like sea level rise, a rapidly subsiding bottom can overwhelm coral growth, killing the coral polyps and the reef, due to what is called coral drowning.[16] Corals that rely on zooxanthellae can drown when the water becomes too deep for their symbionts to adequately photosynthesize, due to decreased light exposure.[17]\\r\\nThe two main variables determining the geomorphology, or shape, of coral reefs are the nature of the underlying substrate on which they rest, and the history of the change in sea level relative to that substrate.\\r\\nThe approximately 20,000-year-old Great Barrier Reef offers an example of how coral reefs formed on continental shelves. Sea level was then 120?m (390?ft) lower than in the 21st century.[18][19] As sea level rose, the water and the corals encroached on what had been hills of the Australian coastal plain. By 13,000 years ago, sea level had risen to 60?m (200?ft) lower than at present, and many hills of the coastal plains had become continental islands. As the sea level rise continued, water topped most of the continental islands. The corals could then overgrow the hills, forming the present cays and reefs. Sea level on the Great Barrier Reef has not changed significantly in the last 6,000 years,[19] and the age of the modern living reef structure is estimated to be between 6,000 and 8,000 years.[20] Although the Great Barrier Reef formed along a continental shelf, and not around a volcanic island, Darwin's principles apply. Development stopped at the barrier reef stage, since Australia is not about to submerge. It formed the world's largest barrier reef, 300ÿ1,000?m (980ÿ3,280?ft) from shore, stretching for 2,000?km (1,200?mi).[21]\\r\\nHealthy tropical coral reefs grow horizontally from 1 to 3?cm (0.39 to 1.18?in) per year, and grow vertically anywhere from 1 to 25?cm (0.39 to 9.84?in) per year; however, they grow only at depths shallower than 150?m (490?ft) because of their need for sunlight, and cannot grow above sea level.[22]\\r\\nAs the name implies, the bulk of coral reefs is made up of coral skeletons from mostly intact coral colonies. As other chemical elements present in corals become incorporated into the calcium carbonate deposits, aragonite is formed. However, shell fragments and the remains of calcareous algae such as the green-segmented genus Halimeda can add to the reef's ability to withstand damage from storms and other threats. Such mixtures are visible in structures such as Eniwetok Atoll.[23]\\r\\nThe three principal reef types are:\\r\\nOther reef types or variants are:\\r\\nCoral reef ecosystems contain distinct zones that represent different kinds of habitats. Usually, three major zones are recognized: the fore reef, reef crest, and the back reef (frequently referred to as the reef lagoon).\\r\\nAll three zones are physically and ecologically interconnected. Reef life and oceanic processes create opportunities for exchange of seawater, sediments, nutrients, and marine life among one another.\\r\\nThus, they are integrated components of the coral reef ecosystem, each playing a role in the support of the reefs' abundant and diverse fish assemblages.\\r\\nMost coral reefs exist in shallow waters less than 50 m deep. Some inhabit tropical continental shelves where cool, nutrient rich upwelling does not occur, such as Great Barrier Reef. Others are found in the deep ocean surrounding islands or as atolls, such as in the Maldives. The reefs surrounding islands form when islands subside into the ocean, and atolls form when an island subsides below the surface of the sea.\\r\\nAlternatively, Moyle and Cech distinguish six zones, though most reefs possess only some of the zones.[25]\\r\\nThe reef surface is the shallowest part of the reef. It is subject to the surge and the rise and fall of tides. When waves pass over shallow areas, they shoal, as shown in the diagram at the right. This means the water is often agitated. These are the precise condition under which corals flourish. Shallowness means there is plenty of light for photosynthesis by the symbiotic zooxanthellae, and agitated water promotes the ability of coral to feed on plankton. However, other organisms must be able to withstand the robust conditions to flourish in this zone.\\r\\nThe off-reef floor is the shallow sea floor surrounding a reef. This zone occurs by reefs on continental shelves. Reefs around tropical islands and atolls drop abruptly to great depths, and do not have a floor. Usually sandy, the floor often supports seagrass meadows which are important foraging areas for reef fish.\\r\\nThe reef drop-off is, for its first 50 m, habitat for many reef fish who find shelter on the cliff face and plankton in the water nearby. The drop-off zone applies mainly to the reefs surrounding oceanic islands and atolls.\\r\\nThe reef face is the zone above the reef floor or the reef drop-off. This zone is often the most diverse area of the reef. Coral and calcareous algae growths provide complex habitats and areas which offer protection, such as cracks and crevices. Invertebrates and epiphytic algae provide much of the food for other organisms.[25] A common feature on this forereef zone is spur and groove formations which serve to transport sediment downslope.\\r\\nThe reef flat is the sandy-bottomed flat, which can be behind the main reef, containing chunks of coral. This zone may border a lagoon and serve as a protective area, or it may lie between the reef and the shore, and in this case is a flat, rocky area. Fishes tend to prefer living in that flat, rocky area, compared to any other zone, when it is present.[25]\\r\\nThe reef lagoon is an entirely enclosed region, which creates an area less affected by wave action that often contains small reef patches.[25]\\r\\nHowever, the \\"topography of coral reefs is constantly changing. Each reef is made up of irregular patches of algae, sessile invertebrates, and bare rock and sand. The size, shape and relative abundance of these patches changes from year to year in response to the various factors that favor one type of patch over another. Growing coral, for example, produces constant change in the fine structure of reefs. On a larger scale, tropical storms may knock out large sections of reef and cause boulders on sandy areas to move.\\"[26]\\r\\nCoral reefs are estimated to cover 284,300?km2 (109,800 sq mi),[27] just under 0.1% of the oceans' surface area. The Indo-Pacific region (including the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia and the Pacific) account for 91.9% of this total. Southeast Asia accounts for 32.3% of that figure, while the Pacific including Australia accounts for 40.8%. Atlantic and Caribbean coral reefs account for 7.6%.[2]\\r\\nAlthough corals exist both in temperate and tropical waters, shallow-water reefs form only in a zone extending from approximately 30?N to 30?S of the equator. Tropical corals do not grow at depths of over 50 meters (160?ft). The optimum temperature for most coral reefs is 26ÿ27?C (79ÿ81?F), and few reefs exist in waters below 18?C (64?F).[28] However, reefs in the Persian Gulf have adapted to temperatures of 13?C (55?F) in winter and 38?C (100?F) in summer.[29] There are 37 species of scleractinian corals identified in such harsh environment around Larak Island.[30]\\r\\nDeep-water coral can exist at greater depths and colder temperatures at much higher latitudes, as far north as Norway.[31] Although deep water corals can form reefs, very little is known about them.\\r\\nCoral reefs are rare along the west coasts of the Americas and Africa, due primarily to upwelling and strong cold coastal currents that reduce water temperatures in these areas (respectively the Peru, Benguela and Canary streams).[32] Corals are seldom found along the coastline of South Asiafrom the eastern tip of India (Chennai) to the Bangladesh and Myanmar borders[2]as well as along the coasts of northeastern South America and Bangladesh, due to the freshwater release from the Amazon and Ganges Rivers respectively.\\r\\nAlive corals are colonies of small animals embedded in calcium carbonate shells. It is a mistake to think of coral as plants or rocks. Coral heads consist of accumulations of individual animals called polyps, arranged in diverse shapes.[37] Polyps are usually tiny, but they can range in size from a pinhead to 12 inches (30?cm) across.\\r\\nReef-building or hermatypic corals live only in the photic zone (above 50?m), the depth to which sufficient sunlight penetrates the water, allowing photosynthesis to occur. Coral polyps do not photosynthesize, but have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae of the genus Symbiodinium, commonly referred to as zooxanthellae. These organisms live within the tissues of polyps and provide organic nutrients that nourish the polyp. Because of this relationship, coral reefs grow much faster in clear water, which admits more sunlight. Without their symbionts, coral growth would be too slow to form significant reef structures. Corals get up to 90% of their nutrients from their symbionts.[38]\\r\\nReefs grow as polyps and other organisms deposit calcium carbonate,[39][40] the basis of coral, as a skeletal structure beneath and around themselves, pushing the coral head's top upwards and outwards.[41] Waves, grazing fish (such as parrotfish), sea urchins, sponges, and other forces and organisms act as bioeroders, breaking down coral skeletons into fragments that settle into spaces in the reef structure or form sandy bottoms in associated reef lagoons. Many other organisms living in the reef community contribute skeletal calcium carbonate in the same manner.[42] Coralline algae are important contributors to reef structure in those parts of the reef subjected to the greatest forces by waves (such as the reef front facing the open ocean). These algae strengthen the reef structure by depositing limestone in sheets over the reef surface.\\r\\nTypical shapes for coral species are wrinkled brains, cabbages, table tops, antlers, wire strands and pillars. These shapes can depend on the life history of the coral, like light exposure and wave action,[43] and events such as breakages.[44]\\r\\nCorals reproduce both sexually and asexually. An individual polyp uses both reproductive modes within its lifetime. Corals reproduce sexually by either internal or external fertilization. The reproductive cells are found on the mesenteries, membranes that radiate inward from the layer of tissue that lines the stomach cavity. Some mature adult corals are hermaphroditic; others are exclusively male or female. A few species change sex as they grow.\\r\\nInternally fertilized eggs develop in the polyp for a period ranging from days to weeks. Subsequent development produces a tiny larva, known as a planula. Externally fertilized eggs develop during synchronized spawning. Polyps release eggs and sperm into the water en masse, simultaneously. Eggs disperse over a large area. The timing of spawning depends on time of year, water temperature, and tidal and lunar cycles. Spawning is most successful when there is little variation between high and low tide. The less water movement, the better the chance for fertilization. Ideal timing occurs in the spring. Release of eggs or planula usually occurs at night, and is sometimes in phase with the lunar cycle (three to six days after a full moon). The period from release to settlement lasts only a few days, but some planulae can survive afloat for several weeks. They are vulnerable to predation and environmental conditions. The lucky few planulae which successfully attach to substrate next confront competition for food and space.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are eight clades of Symbiodinium phylotypes. Most research has been completed on the Symbiodinium clades AÿD. Each one of the eight contributes their own benefits as well as less compatible attributes to the survival of their coral hosts. Each photosynthetic organism has a specific level of sensitivity to photodamage of compounds needed for survival, such as proteins. Rates of regeneration and replication determine the organism's ability to survive. Phylotype A is found more in the shallow regions of marine waters. It is able to produce mycosporine-like amino acids that are UV resistant, using a derivative of glycerin to absorb the UV radiation and allowing them to become more receptive to warmer water temperatures. In the event of UV or thermal damage, if and when repair occurs, it will increase the likelihood of survival of the host and symbiont. This leads to the idea that, evolutionarily, clade A is more UV resistant and thermally resistant than the other clades.[45]\\r\\nClades B and C are found more frequently in the deeper water regions, which may explain the higher susceptibility to increased temperatures. Terrestrial plants that receive less sunlight because they are found in the undergrowth can be analogized to clades B, C, and D. Since clades B through D are found at deeper depths, they require an elevated light absorption rate to be able to synthesize as much energy. With elevated absorption rates at UV wavelengths, the deeper occurring phylotypes are more prone to coral bleaching versus the more shallow clades. Clade D has been observed to be high temperature-tolerant, and as a result it has a higher rate of survival than clades B and C.[45]\\r\\nBrain coral\\r\\nStaghorn coral\\r\\nSpiral wire coral\\r\\nPillar coral\\r\\nMushroom coral\\r\\nMaze coral\\r\\nBlack coral\\r\\nFluorescent coral[46]\\r\\nRecent oceanographic research has brought to light the reality of this paradox by confirming that the oligotrophy of the ocean euphotic zone persists right up to the swell-battered reef crest. When you approach the reef edges and atolls from the quasidesert of the open sea, the near absence of living matter suddenly becomes a plethora of life, without transition. So why is there something rather than nothing, and more precisely, where do the necessary nutrients for the functioning of this extraordinary coral reef machine come from?\\"\\r\\nIn The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, published in 1842, Darwin described how coral reefs were found in some areas of the tropical seas but not others, with no obvious cause. The largest and strongest corals grew in parts of the reef exposed to the most violent surf and corals were weakened or absent where loose sediment accumulated.[48]\\r\\nTropical waters contain few nutrients[49] yet a coral reef can flourish like an \\"oasis in the desert\\".[50] This has given rise to the ecosystem conundrum, sometimes called \\"Darwin's paradox\\": \\"How can such high production flourish in such nutrient poor conditions?\\"[51][52][53]\\r\\nCoral reefs cover less than 0.1% of the surface of the worlds ocean, about half the land area of France, yet they support over one-quarter of all marine species. This diversity results in complex food webs, with large predator fish eating smaller forage fish that eat yet smaller zooplankton and so on. However, all food webs eventually depend on plants, which are the primary producers. Coral reefs' primary productivity is very high, typically producing 5ÿ10 grams of carbon per square meter per day (gC{m?2{day?1) biomass.[54][55]\\r\\nOne reason for the unusual clarity of tropical waters is they are deficient in nutrients and drifting plankton. Further, the sun shines year-round in the tropics, warming the surface layer, making it less dense than subsurface layers. The warmer water is separated from deeper, cooler water by a stable thermocline, where the temperature makes a rapid change. This keeps the warm surface waters floating above the cooler deeper waters. In most parts of the ocean, there is little exchange between these layers. Organisms that die in aquatic environments generally sink to the bottom, where they decompose, which releases nutrients in the form of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). These nutrients are necessary for plant growth, but in the tropics, they do not directly return to the surface.[citation needed]\\r\\nPlants form the base of the food chain, and need sunlight and nutrients to grow. In the ocean, these plants are mainly microscopic phytoplankton which drift in the water column. They need sunlight for photosynthesis, which powers carbon fixation, so they are found only relatively near the surface. But they also need nutrients. Phytoplankton rapidly use nutrients in the surface waters, and in the tropics, these nutrients are not usually replaced because of the thermocline.[citation needed]\\r\\nAround coral reefs, lagoons fill in with material eroded from the reef and the island. They become havens for marine life, providing protection from waves and storms.\\r\\nMost importantly, reefs recycle nutrients, which happens much less in the open ocean. In coral reefs and lagoons, producers include phytoplankton, as well as seaweed and coralline algae, especially small types called turf algae, which pass nutrients to corals.[56] The phytoplankton are eaten by fish and crustaceans, who also pass nutrients along the food web. Recycling ensures fewer nutrients are needed overall to support the community.\\r\\nCoral reefs support many symbiotic relationships. In particular, zooxanthellae provide energy to coral in the form of glucose, glycerol, and amino acids.[57] Zooxanthellae can provide up to 90% of a corals energy requirements.[38] In return, as an example of mutualism, the corals shelter the zooxanthellae, averaging one million for every cubic centimeter of coral, and provide a constant supply of the carbon dioxide they need for photosynthesis.\\r\\nCorals also absorb nutrients, including inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, directly from water. Many corals extend their tentacles at night to catch zooplankton that brush them when the water is agitated. Zooplankton provide the polyp with nitrogen, and the polyp shares some of the nitrogen with the zooxanthellae, which also require this element.[56] The varying pigments in different species of zooxanthellae give them an overall brown or golden-brown appearance, and give brown corals their colors. Other pigments such as reds, blues, greens, etc. come from colored proteins made by the coral animals. Coral which loses a large fraction of its zooxanthellae becomes white (or sometimes pastel shades in corals that are richly pigmented with their own colorful proteins) and is said to be bleached, a condition which, unless corrected, can kill the coral.\\r\\nSponges are another key: they live in crevices in the coral reefs. They are efficient filter feeders, and in the Red Sea they consume about 60% of the phytoplankton that drifts by. The sponges eventually excrete nutrients in a form the corals can use.[58]\\r\\nThe roughness of coral surfaces is the key to coral survival in agitated waters. Normally, a boundary layer of still water surrounds a submerged object, which acts as a barrier. Waves breaking on the extremely rough edges of corals disrupt the boundary layer, allowing the corals access to passing nutrients. Turbulent water thereby promotes reef growth and branching. Without the nutritional gains brought by rough coral surfaces, even the most effective recycling would leave corals wanting in nutrients.[59]\\r\\nStudies have shown that deep nutrient-rich water entering coral reefs through isolated events may have significant effects on temperature and nutrient systems.[60][61] This water movement disrupts the relatively stable thermocline that usually exists between warm shallow water to deeper colder water. Leichter et al. (2006)[62] found that temperature regimes on coral reefs in the Bahamas and Florida were highly variable with temporal scales of minutes to seasons and spatial scales across depths.\\r\\nWater can be moved through coral reefs in various ways, including current rings, surface waves, internal waves and tidal changes.[60][63][64][65] Movement is generally created by tides and wind. As tides interact with varying bathymetry and wind mixes with surface water, internal waves are created. An internal wave is a gravity wave that moves along density stratification within the ocean. When a water parcel encounters a different density it will oscillate and create internal waves.[66] While internal waves generally have a lower frequency than surface waves, they often form as a single wave that breaks into multiple waves as it hits a slope and moves upward.[67] This vertical break up of internal waves causes significant diapycnal mixing and turbulence.[68][69] Internal waves can act as nutrient pumps, bringing plankton and cool nutrient-rich water up to the surface.[60][65][70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78]\\r\\nThe irregular structure characteristic of coral reef bathymetry may enhance mixing and produce pockets of cooler water and variable nutrient content.[79] Arrival of cool, nutrient-rich water from depths due to internal waves and tidal bores has been linked to growth rates of suspension feeders and benthic algae[65][78][80] as well as plankton and larval organisms.[65][81] Leichter et al.[78] proposed that Codium isthmocladum react to deep water nutrient sources due to their tissues having different concentrations of nutrients dependent upon depth. Wolanski and Hamner[72] noted aggregations of eggs, larval organisms and plankton on reefs in response to deep water intrusions. Similarly, as internal waves and bores move vertically, surface-dwelling larval organisms are carried toward the shore.[81] This has significant biological importance to cascading effects of food chains in coral reef ecosystems and may provide yet another key to unlocking \\"Darwin's Paradox\\".\\r\\nCyanobacteria provide soluble nitrates for the reef via nitrogen fixation.[82]\\r\\nCoral reefs also often depend on surrounding habitats, such as seagrass meadows and mangrove forests, for nutrients. Seagrass and mangroves supply dead plants and animals which are rich in nitrogen and also serve to feed fish and animals from the reef by supplying wood and vegetation. Reefs, in turn, protect mangroves and seagrass from waves and produce sediment in which the mangroves and seagrass can root.[29]\\r\\nCoral reefs form some of the world's most productive ecosystems, providing complex and varied marine habitats that support a wide range of other organisms.[83][84]Fringing reefs just below low tide level have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and sea grass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This level of variety in the environment benefits many coral reef animals, which, for example, may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.[85]\\r\\nReefs are home to a large variety of animals, including fish, seabirds, sponges, cnidarians (which includes some types of corals and jellyfish), worms, crustaceans (including shrimp, cleaner shrimp, spiny lobsters and crabs), mollusks (including cephalopods), echinoderms (including starfish, sea urchins and sea cucumbers), sea squirts, sea turtles and sea snakes. Aside from humans, mammals are rare on coral reefs, with visiting cetaceans such as dolphins being the main exception. A few of these varied species feed directly on corals, while others graze on algae on the reef.[2][56] Reef biomass is positively related to species diversity.[86]\\r\\nThe same hideouts in a reef may be regularly inhabited by different species at different times of day. Nighttime predators such as cardinalfish and squirrelfish hide during the day, while damselfish, surgeonfish, triggerfish, wrasses and parrotfish hide from eels and sharks.[23]:49\\r\\nReefs are chronically at risk of algal encroachment. Overfishing and excess nutrient supply from onshore can enable algae to outcompete and kill the coral.[87][88] Increased nutrient levels can be a result of sewage or chemical fertilizer runoff from nearby coastal developments. Runoff can carry nitrogen and phosphorus which promote excess algae growth. Algae can sometimes out-compete the coral for space. The algae can then smother the coral by decreasing the oxygen supply available to the reef. Decreased oxygen levels can slow down coral's calcification rates weakening the coral and leaving it more susceptible to disease and degradation.[89] In surveys done around largely uninhabited US Pacific islands, algae inhabit a large percentage of surveyed coral locations.[90] The algal population consists of turf algae, coralline algae, and macro algae.\\r\\nSponges are essential for the functioning of the coral reef's ecosystem. Algae and corals in coral reefs produce organic material. This is filtered through sponges which convert this organic material into small particles which in turn are absorbed by algae and corals.[91]\\r\\nOver 4,000 species of fish inhabit coral reefs.[2] The reasons for this diversity remain unclear. Hypotheses include the \\"lottery\\", in which the first (lucky winner) recruit to a territory is typically able to defend it against latecomers, \\"competition\\", in which adults compete for territory, and less-competitive species must be able to survive in poorer habitat, and \\"predation\\", in which population size is a function of postsettlement piscivore mortality.[92] Healthy reefs can produce up to 35 tons of fish per square kilometer each year, but damaged reefs produce much less.[93]\\r\\nSea urchins, Dotidae and sea slugs eat seaweed. Some species of sea urchins, such as Diadema antillarum, can play a pivotal part in preventing algae from overrunning reefs.[94] Nudibranchia and sea anemones eat sponges.\\r\\nA number of invertebrates, collectively called \\"cryptofauna,\\" inhabit the coral skeletal substrate itself, either boring into the skeletons (through the process of bioerosion) or living in pre-existing voids and crevices. Those animals boring into the rock include sponges, bivalve mollusks, and sipunculans. Those settling on the reef include many other species, particularly crustaceans and polychaete worms.[32]\\r\\nCoral reef systems provide important habitats for seabird species, some endangered. For example, Midway Atoll in Hawaii supports nearly three million seabirds, including two-thirds (1.5 million) of the global population of Laysan albatross, and one-third of the global population of black-footed albatross.[95] Each seabird species has specific sites on the atoll where they nest. Altogether, 17 species of seabirds live on Midway. The short-tailed albatross is the rarest, with fewer than 2,200 surviving after excessive feather hunting in the late 19th century.[96]\\r\\nSea snakes feed exclusively on fish and their eggs.[97][98][99] Marine birds, such as herons, gannets, pelicans and boobies, feed on reef fish. Some land-based reptiles intermittently associate with reefs, such as monitor lizards, the marine crocodile and semiaquatic snakes, such as Laticauda colubrina. Sea turtles, particularly hawksbill sea turtles, feed on sponges.[100][101][102]\\r\\nSchooling reef fish\\r\\nCaribbean reef squid\\r\\nBanded coral shrimp\\r\\nWhitetip reef shark\\r\\nGreen turtle\\r\\nGiant clam\\r\\nSoft coral, cup coral, sponges and ascidians\\r\\nBanded sea krait\\r\\nThe shell of Latiaxis wormaldi, a coral snail\\r\\nCoral reefs deliver ecosystem services to tourism, fisheries and coastline protection. The global economic value of coral reefs has been estimated to be between US $29.8 billion[6] and $375 billion per year.[7] Coral reefs protect shorelines by absorbing wave energy, and many small islands would not exist without their reefs to protect them. According to the environmental group World Wide Fund for Nature, the economic cost over a 25-year period of destroying one kilometer of coral reef is somewhere between $137,000 and $1,200,000.[103] About six million tons of fish are taken each year from coral reefs. Well-managed coral reefs have an annual yield of 15 tons of seafood on average per square kilometer. Southeast Asia's coral reef fisheries alone yield about $2.4 billion annually from seafood.[103]\\r\\nTo improve the management of coastal coral reefs, another environmental group, the World Resources Institute (WRI) developed and published tools for calculating the value of coral reef-related tourism, shoreline protection and fisheries, partnering with five Caribbean countries. As of April 2011, published working papers covered St. Lucia, Tobago, Belize, and the Dominican Republic, with a paper for Jamaica in preparation. The WRI was also \\"making sure that the study results support improved coastal policies and management planning\\".[104] The Belize study estimated the value of reef and mangrove services at $395ÿ559 million annually.[105]\\r\\nBermuda's coral reefs provide economic benefits to the Island worth on average $722 million per year, based on six key ecosystem services, according to Sarkis et al (2010).[106]\\r\\nCoral reefs are dying around the world.[107] In particular, coral mining, agricultural and urban runoff, pollution (organic and inorganic), overfishing, blast fishing, disease, and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems. Broader threats are sea temperature rise, sea level rise and pH changes from ocean acidification, all associated with greenhouse gas emissions. A 2014 study lists factors such as population explosion along the coast lines, overfishing, the pollution of coastal areas, global warming and invasive species among the main reasons that have put reefs in danger of extinction.[108]\\r\\nA study released in April 2013 has shown that air pollution can also stunt the growth of coral reefs; researchers from Australia, Panama and the UK used coral records (between 1880 and 2000) from the western Caribbean to show the threat of factors such as coal-burning coal and volcanic eruptions.[109] Pollutants, such as Tributyltin, a biocide released into water from in anti-fouling paint can be toxic to corals.\\r\\nIn 2011, researchers suggested that \\"extant marine invertebrates face the same synergistic effects of multiple stressors\\" that occurred during the end-Permian extinction, and that genera \\"with poorly buffered respiratory physiology and calcareous shells\\", such as corals, were particularly vulnerable.[110][111][112]\\r\\nRock coral on seamounts across the ocean are under fire from bottom trawling. Reportedly up to 50% of the catch is rock coral, and the practice transforms coral structures to rubble. With it taking years to regrow, these coral communities are disappearing faster than they can sustain themselves.[113]\\r\\nAnother cause for the death of coral reefs is bioerosion. Various fishes graze corals, dead or alive and change the morphology of coral reefs making them more susceptible to other physical and chemical threats. It has been generally observed that only the algae growing on dead corals is eaten and the live ones are not. However, this act still destroys the top layer of coral substrate and makes it harder for the reefs to sustain.[114]\\r\\nIn El Ni?o-year 2010, preliminary reports show global coral bleaching reached its worst level since another El Ni?o year, 1998, when 16% of the world's reefs died as a result of increased water temperature. In Indonesia's Aceh province, surveys showed some 80% of bleached corals died. Scientists do not yet understand the long-term impacts of coral bleaching, but they do know that bleaching leaves corals vulnerable to disease, stunts their growth, and affects their reproduction, while severe bleaching kills them.[115] In July, Malaysia closed several dive sites where virtually all the corals were damaged by bleaching.[116][117]\\r\\nTo find answers for these problems, researchers study the various factors that impact reefs. The list includes the ocean's role as a carbon dioxide sink, atmospheric changes, ultraviolet light, ocean acidification, viruses, impacts of dust storms carrying agents to far-flung reefs, pollutants, algal blooms and others. Reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas.[citation needed] Coral reefs with one type of zooxanthellae are more prone to bleaching than are reefs with another, more hardy, species.[118]\\r\\nGeneral estimates show approximately 10% of the world's coral reefs are dead.[119][120] About 60% of the world's reefs are at risk due to destructive, human-related activities. The threat to the health of reefs is particularly high in Southeast Asia, where 95% of reefs are at risk from local threats.[121] By the 2030s, 90% of reefs are expected to be at risk from both human activities and climate change; by 2050, all coral reefs will be in danger.[122]\\r\\nCurrent research is showing that ecotourism in the Great Barrier Reef is contributing to coral disease,[123] and that chemicals in sunscreens may contribute to the impact of viruses on zooxanthellae.[8]\\r\\nSome scientists, including those associated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, posit that US coral reefs are likely to disappear within a few decades as a result of global warming.[124]\\r\\nMarine protected areas (MPAs) have become increasingly prominent for reef management. MPAs promote responsible fishery management and habitat protection. Much like national parks and wildlife refuges, and to varying degrees, MPAs restrict potentially damaging activities. MPAs encompass both social and biological objectives, including reef restoration, aesthetics, biodiversity, and economic benefits. However, there are very few MPAs that have actually made a substantial difference. Research in Indonesia, Philippines and Papua New Guinea shows that there is no significant difference between an MPA site and an unprotected site.[125][126] Conflicts surrounding MPAs involve lack of participation, clashing views of the government and fisheries, effectiveness of the area, and funding.[127] In some situations, as in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, MPAs can also provide revenue, potentially equal to the income they would have generated without controls, as Kiribati did for its Phoenix Islands.[128]\\r\\nAccording to the Caribbean Coral Reefs - Status Report 1970-2012 made by the IUCN. States that; stopping overfishing especially key fishes to coral reef like parrotfish, coastal zone management which reduce human pressure on reef, (for example restricting the coastal settlement, development and tourism in coastal reef) and controlling pollution specially sewage wastage, may not only reduce coral declining but also reverse it and may let to coral reef more adaptable to changes relates to climate and acidification. The report shows that healthier reef in the Caribbean are those with large population of parrotfish in countries which protect these key fishes and sea urchins, banning fish trap and Spearfishing creating \\"resilient reefs\\".[129]\\r\\nTo help combat ocean acidification, some laws are in place to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. The Clean Water Act puts pressure on state government agencies to monitor and limit runoff of pollutants that can cause ocean acidification. Stormwater surge preventions are also in place, as well as coastal buffers between agricultural land and the coastline. This act also ensures that delicate watershed ecosystems are intact, such as wetlands. The Clean Water Act is funded by the federal government, and is monitored by various watershed groups. Many land use laws aim to reduce CO2 emissions by limiting deforestation. Deforestation causes erosion, which releases a large amount of carbon stored in the soil, which then flows into the ocean, contributing to ocean acidification. Incentives are used to reduce miles traveled by vehicles, which reduces the carbon emissions into the atmosphere, thereby reducing the amount of dissolved CO2 in the ocean. State and federal governments also control coastal erosion, which releases stored carbon in the soil into the ocean, increasing ocean acidification.[130] High-end satellite technology is increasingly being employed to monitor coral reef conditions.[131]\\r\\nBiosphere reserve, marine park, national monument and world heritage status can protect reefs. For example, Belize's barrier reef, Sian Ka'an, the Galapagos islands, Great Barrier Reef, Henderson Island, Palau and Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument are world heritage sites.[132]\\r\\nIn Australia, the Great Barrier Reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and is the subject of much legislation, including a biodiversity action plan.[133] They have compiled a Coral Reef Resilience Action Plan. This detailed action plan consists of numerous adaptive management strategies, including reducing our carbon footprint, which would ultimately reduce the amount of ocean acidification in the oceans surrounding the Great Barrier Reef. An extensive public awareness plan is also in place to provide education on the rainforests of the sea and how people can reduce carbon emissions, thereby reducing ocean acidification.[134]\\r\\nInhabitants of Ahus Island, Manus Province, Papua New Guinea, have followed a generations-old practice of restricting fishing in six areas of their reef lagoon. Their cultural traditions allow line fishing, but no net or spear fishing. The result is both the biomass and individual fish sizes are significantly larger than in places where fishing is unrestricted.[135][136]\\r\\nCoral aquaculture, also known as coral farming or coral gardening, is showing promise as a potentially effective tool for restoring coral reefs, which have been declining around the world.[137][138][139] The process bypasses the early growth stages of corals when they are most at risk of dying. Coral seeds are grown in nurseries, then replanted on the reef.[140] Coral is farmed by coral farmers who live locally to the reefs and farm for reef conservation or for income.\\r\\nEfforts to expand the size and number of coral reefs generally involve supplying substrate to allow more corals to find a home. Substrate materials include discarded vehicle tires, scuttled ships, subway cars, and formed concrete, such as reef balls. Reefs also grow unaided on marine structures such as oil rigs.[citation needed] In large restoration projects, propagated hermatypic coral on substrate can be secured with metal pins, superglue or milliput.[141] Needle and thread can also attach A-hermatype coral to substrate.[142]\\r\\nA substrate for growing corals referred to as Biorock is produced by running low voltage electrical currents through seawater to crystallize dissolved minerals onto steel structures. The resultant white carbonate (aragonite) is the same mineral that makes up natural coral reefs. Corals rapidly colonize and grow at accelerated rates on these coated structures. The electrical currents also accelerate formation and growth of both chemical limestone rock and the skeletons of corals and other shell-bearing organisms. The vicinity of the anode and cathode provides a high-pH environment which inhibits the growth of competitive filamentous and fleshy algae. The increased growth rates fully depend on the accretion activity.[143]\\r\\nDuring accretion, the settled corals display an increased growth rate, size and density, but after the process is complete, growth rate and density return to levels comparable to natural growth, and are about the same size or slightly smaller.[143]\\r\\nOne case study with coral reef restoration was conducted on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The University of Hawaii has come up with a Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program to help relocate and restore coral reefs in Hawaii. A boat channel on the island of Oahu to the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology was overcrowded with coral reefs. Also, many areas of coral reef patches in the channel had been damaged from past dredging in the channel. Dredging covers the existing corals with sand, and their larvae cannot build and thrive on sand; they can only build on to existing reefs. Because of this, the University of Hawaii decided to relocate some of the coral reef to a different transplant site. They transplanted them with the help of the United States Army divers, to a relocation site relatively close to the channel. They observed very little, if any, damage occurred to any of the colonies while they were being transported, and no mortality of coral reefs has been observed on the new transplant site, but they will be continuing to monitor the new transplant site to see how potential environmental impacts (i.e. ocean acidification) will harm the overall reef mortality rate. While trying to attach the coral to the new transplant site, they found the coral placed on hard rock is growing considerably well, and coral was even growing on the wires that attached the transplant corals to the transplant site. This gives new hope to future research on coral reef transplant sites. As a result of this coral restoration project, no environmental effects were seen from the transplantation process, no recreational activities were decreased, and no scenic areas were affected by the project. This is a great example that coral transplantation and restoration can work and thrive under the right conditions, which means there may be hope for other damaged coral reefs.[144]\\r\\nAnother possibility for coral restoration is gene therapy. Through infecting coral with genetically modified bacteria, it may be possible to grow corals that are more resistant to climate change and other threats.[145]\\r\\nThroughout Earth history, from a few thousand years after hard skeletons were developed by marine organisms, there were almost always reefs. The times of maximum development were in the Middle Cambrian (513ÿ501 Ma), Devonian (416ÿ359 Ma) and Carboniferous (359ÿ299 Ma), owing to order Rugosa extinct corals, and Late Cretaceous (100ÿ66 Ma) and all Neogene (23 Maÿpresent), owing to order Scleractinia corals.\\r\\nNot all reefs in the past were formed by corals: those in the Early Cambrian (542ÿ513 Ma) resulted from calcareous algae and archaeocyathids (small animals with conical shape, probably related to sponges) and in the Late Cretaceous (100ÿ66 Ma), when there also existed reefs formed by a group of bivalves called rudists; one of the valves formed the main conical structure and the other, much smaller valve acted as a cap.\\r\\nMeasurements of the oxygen isotopic composition of the aragonitic skeleton of coral reefs, such as Porites, can indicate changes in the sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity conditions of the ocean during the growth of the coral. This technique is often used by climate scientists to infer the paleoclimate of a region.[146]","field3":"Who discovered the process of coral reef development?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Amarinder Singh","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Amarinder Singh (born 11 March 1942)[1] is an Indian politician, who is currently the 26th Chief Minister of Punjab.[2] An elected Member of the Legislative Assembly from Patiala,[3] he was also the president of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, the state division of the Indian National Congress.[4] He has also previously served as the Chief Minister of Punjab from 2002-2007.[5] His father was the last Maharaja of the princely state of Patiala.[5] He also served in  the Indian Army from 1963 to 1966.[6] In 1980, he won a seat in the Lok Sabha for the first time.[5]He currently also serves as the chairman of the Punjab Urdu Academy.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nSingh is the son of Maharaja Yadavindra Singh  and  Maharani Mohinder Kaur of Patiala belonging to the Phulkian dynasty of Sidhu Brar descent.[8] He attended the Welham Boys' School and Lawrence School Sanawar[9] before going to The Doon School,[10] Dehradun.

It has been an alcoholic beverage control state, with the Oregon Liquor Control Commission holding a monopoly over the sale of all distilled beverages, since Prohibition. Today, there are thriving industries producing beer, wine, and liquor in the state. Alcohol may be purchased between 7 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. As of 2007, consumption of spirits is on the rise, while beer consumption is holding steady. Also, 11% of beer sold in Oregon was brewed in-state, the highest figure in the United States.\\r\\nOregon wine production began in the mid-19th century, before it was a state. By 1919, the industry had collapsed due to prohibition, and after prohibition ended fruit wines dominated the industry. The modern era of Oregon wine began in 1961, and the industry cemented its reputation in 1975 by winning a French award. In 2007, wine making was a $207.8 million business. Beer production began in 1852 with Henry Saxer's liberty brewing in Portland. In 1862 Henry Weinhard's bought the Liberty brewery. The company is now a part of the Miller Brewing Company, but it helped Portland to become the microbrewing capital of the world. Portland hosts North America's largest beerfest, and Oregon has produced a number of national and international award winning beers.\\r\\nIn 1844, the Oregon territories voted to prohibit alcoholic beverages. This was repealed in 1845, but prohibition was reinstated in a 1915, four years before the national alcohol prohibition. When national prohibition was repealed in 1933, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) was created. Unlike states that allow liquor sales in grocery stores, liquor in Oregon is sold only in OLCC run liquor stores and establishments that have liquor licenses, and the OLCC has strict guidelines and training to ensure that all licensed venues understand how to safely sell and serve alcoholic beverages.[1] Alcohol and alcoholism are also studied by the state at the Portland Alcohol Research Center.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlcohol laws in Oregon permit the sale of beer, wine, and liquor, for on- or off-premises consumption, between 7 a.m. and 2:30 a.m.[2] In 2004, Oregonians consumed 5,103,000 US gallons (19,320,000?L) of distilled spirits, 11,132,000 US gallons (42,140,000?L) of wine, and 80,415,000 US gallons (304,400,000?L) of beer, ranking it 27th, 19th, and 27th respectively of US states.[3] Oregon had an estimated population of 3,594,586 in 2004, ranking it 27th among US states.[4]\\r\\nIn 2007, sales of spirits increased 9% over the previous year. Whiskey and vodka were the top sellers, while tequila had the largest percentage increase. Oregonian's top buy was Jack Daniel's, with 412,000 bottles sold. This was during a national spirits trend where manufacturers introduced new products and advertising aimed at young drinkers. Again in 2007, Oregon's 2.6 million adults on average drank 32 gallons of beer each, versus 4 gallons of wine and 2 gallons of spirits, but sales of beer hadn't increased like sales of spirits. The Oregon Department of Human Services reported that while drinking among 8thÿ11th graders has fallen nationally, it has increased in Oregon. The number of DUI offenses dropped between 2002 and 2005, from 25,342 to 23,455.[5]\\r\\nThe following table lists the amount of beer consumed in Oregon for the years 1997ÿ2004 as reported in the 2005 Beer Handbook. The scale is in 1,000s of cases of beer. A case of beer is 24 12-ounce beers, for a total of 2.25 gallons per case.[3]\\r\\nWine grapes were planted in Oregon in the Willamette Valley starting in 1847. A census in 1860 revealed that Oregon's wine production was 2,600 gallons. In the 1880s and 1890s, German immigrants began planting wine grapes in Southern Oregon. In the 1880s, Ernest Reuter garnered a reputation for his Klevner wines, grown in the Willamette Valley, west of Forest Grove. By 1919, the Oregon wine industry had collapsed due to the temperance movement and resulting prohibition. Fruit wines dominated Oregon's wine industry post-prohibition, and by 1938 there were 28 bonded wineries, producing wines based on berries, Concord grapes, and other American hybrids.[6]\\r\\nOregon's modern wine industry dates to 1961 when Hillcrest Vineyard in Roseburg began planting Riesling and small amounts of other grapes. In 1965, Oregon pinot noir was established when The Eyrie Vineyards planted grapes near Corvallis.[6] Oregon's wine reputation was made in 1979 when a French magazine ranked The Eyrie's 1975 Pinot noir third among 330 wines of the world.[7] By 2007, Oregon wineries were producing 1.7 million cases of wine for a total of $207.8 million in sales.[8]\\r\\nThere are several official American Viticultural Areas entirely within the state, including the Willamette Valley, Southern Oregon, Umpqua Valley, and Rogue Valley AVAs. Parts of the Columbia Gorge, Walla Walla Valley, and Snake River Valley AVAs lie within Oregon.[9] Pinot noir and Pinot gris are the top two grapes grown.[10]\\r\\nIn 1862, German immigrant Henry Weinhard founded a brewery in Portland. By the early 1880s it had become the Northwest's largest brewery. Weinhard once attempted to pump free beer through Portland's Skidmore Fountain. He died in 1904, but the company continued to do well, making it through prohibition by brewing soft drinks and merging with Arnold Blitz, a local competitor. Blitz-Weinhard was sold to the Pabst Brewing Company in 1979, and then again to the Miller Brewing Company in 1999. The company helped prepare Oregon beer drinkers for the arrival of microbrewing.[11]\\r\\nPortland, Oregon is considered to be the nation's microbrew capital.[12][13][14] A microbrewery is defined as one that produces less than 15,000 barrels a year. Portland hosts the Oregon Brewers Festival, North America's largest beer festival. The microbrewery industry began in 1979 when President Jimmy Carter legalized home brewing. In 2006, 14 beers from eight Oregon breweries won medals at the Great American Beer Festival, out of 2,800 entries. Also in 2006, Oregon won 11 times at the World Beer Cup, in a field of 2,200 beers. In 2007, 11% of beer sold in Oregon was brewed in-state, the highest figure in the United States. According to the Oregon Hop Commission, in 2007, Oregon was also the second largest U.S. hops producer, after Washington.[14]\\r\\nAs of 2008, Oregon contains 12 of the nation's 142 craft distilleries, up from six in 2006. In 2007, a law was approved allowing tasting rooms and direct sales to the public. Jim Dodge, purchasing manager for the OLCC, believes that the distilleries are an outgrowth of the microbrew industry, instead of the wine industry, as well as a societal change. Dodge explained that \\"there's been a recent shift from beer, and to some degree wine, to distilled spirits as the alcohol of choice.\\"[15]\\r\\nIn 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined that absinthe was legal, though it had been understood to be illegal for about 80 years. Portland distillery Integrity Spirits responded by releasing the second American-made absinthe, which was in high demand immediately upon its release.[16]\\r\\nOregon has been regulating alcohol through its laws for over 150 years. In 1844, the Oregon Territory voted to prohibit alcoholic beverages. This is often referred to as the first prohibition in the United States. The law was repealed in 1845.[17] From 1845 to 1915, various local laws governing alcohol were passed. In 1915, Oregonians voted to ban all alcohol, preceding national alcohol prohibition by four years.[17]\\r\\nIn 1933, national prohibition ended with a repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Oregon's governor, Julius Meier, appointed Dr. William S. Knox to study the situation. Knox recommended adopting the Canadian system of sales of alcohol by the state. The reasoning was that this would provide revenue and lower alcohol abuse.[17]\\r\\nThe Oregon Legislative Assembly held a special session and the OLCC was created days after the repeal of national prohibition.[18] Eighteen states in total chose to regulate alcohol. Oregon Revised Statutes Chapters 471, 472, 473 and 474 were the commission's enabling statutes. OAR Chapter 845 governed its administrative rules. The OLCC's mission is \\"to effectively regulate the sale, distribution, and responsible use of alcoholic beverages in order to protect Oregon's public health, safety and community livability.\\"[17] However, under these laws bootlegging in Oregon was rife and Portland became infamous as a center of corruption.\\r\\nIn 1939, the advertising of hard liquor on billboards and in newspapers was voluntarily discontinued. Also, in 1939, a \\"club bill\\" was passed by the Legislative Assembly. The bill gave regulatory power to the OLCC over hotels, restaurants and private clubs where liquor was served. Lobbyists then succeeded in having the bill referred to the voters in 1940. Voters passed the bill in 1940.[17]\\r\\nIn 1944, the \\"Burke Bill\\" became law: wines with more than 14% alcohol could only be sold by Commission stores and agencies. Also in the 1940s, a \\"service bars\\" license was established. This restricted liquor licenses to establishments serving food. In 1949, the Legislative Assembly approved a method where establishments that sold liquor could ask for proof of age from patrons they thought were under the age of 21.[17] Measure 15passed in 1952amended the Constitution (Article I, section 39) to regulate the sale of liquor by the individual glass.[19]\\r\\nFive more types of licenses were created in the 1950s, dealing with liquor-by-the-drink operations, industry agents, salesmen, out-of-state manufacturers of malt beverages, and conventions, group meetings, etc. In 1960, establishments were required to have food sales equal to 25% of their total sales. In the 1970s, the OLCC began enforcing the Oregon Bottle Bill and wines of up to 20% alcohol became allowed with certain licenses. In the 1980s, the number of OLCC commissioners was changed from three to five, to reflect the number of congressional districts. The 1990s saw a flurry of laws passed governing the OLCC's oversight of the newly numerous Oregon wineries and microbreweries.[17] House Bill 4028ÿpassed in 2002ÿallowed liquor stores to operate on Sunday; they had previously been restricted to six days a week.[20]\\r\\nThis sort of licensing is very important for maintaining safe production and sales of alcoholic beverages in Oregon.

The vault is used to store a large portion of United States official gold reserves and occasionally other precious items belonging or entrusted to the federal government. It is estimated to hold roughly 2.3% of all the gold ever refined throughout human history.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1933, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102, which outlawed the private ownership of gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates by American citizens, forcing them to sell these to the Federal Reserve. As a result, the value of the gold held by the Federal Reserve increased from $4 billion to $12 billion between 1933 and 1937.[3] This left the federal government with a large gold reserve and no place to store it. In 1936, the U.S. Treasury Department began construction of the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky, on land transferred from the military. The Gold Vault was completed in December 1936 for US $560,000. The site is located on what is now Bullion Boulevard at the intersection of Gold Vault Road.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, in recognition of its significance in the economic history of the United States and its status as a well-known landmark.[4] It is constructed of granite quarried at the North Carolina Granite Corporation Quarry Complex.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first gold shipments were made from January to July 1937. The majority of the United States' gold reserves were gradually shipped to the site, including old bullion and newly made bars made from melted gold coins. Some intact coins were stored. The transfer used a special 9 car train manned by machine gunners and transferred to US Army trucks protected by a US Cavalry brigade.[6] In 1974, a Washington attorney named Peter David Beter circulated a theory that the gold in the Depository had been secretly removed by elites, and that the vaults were empty. A group of reporters was allowed inside in order to refute the theory, which had gained traction thanks to coverage in tabloid newspapers and on the radio. Other than this 1974 event, no member of the public has been allowed inside.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, the depository held the original U.S. Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution. It held the reserves of European countries and key documents from Western history. For example, it held the Crown of St. Stephen, part of the Hungarian crown jewels, given to American soldiers to prevent them from falling into Soviet hands. The repository held one of four copies (exemplifications) of Magna Carta, which had been sent for display at the 1939 New York World's Fair, and when war broke out, was kept in the US for the duration.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II and into the Cold War, until the invention of different types of synthetic painkillers, a supply of processed morphine and opium was kept in the Depository as a hedge against the US being isolated from the sources of raw opium.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow the fortress-like structure lies the gold vault lined with granite walls and protected by a blast-proof door weighing 20 tons. Members of the Depository staff must dial separate combinations known only to them.[9] Beyond the main vault door, smaller compartments provide further protection.[10] According to a Mosler Safe Company brochure:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most famous, if not the largest, vault door order came from the Federal government in 1935 for the newly constructed gold depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Both the vault door and emergency door were 21-inches thick and made of the latest torch- and drill-resistant material. The main vault door weighed 20 tons and the vault casing was 25-inches thick.[11]\\r\\nThe facility is ringed with fences and is guarded by the United States Mint Police. The Depository is near the main entrance to Fort Knox, potentially allowing the Army to provide additional protection.[citation needed] The Depository is protected by layers of physical security, alarms, video cameras, microphones, mine fields, barbed razor wire, electric fences, and heavily armed guards.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an escape tunnel from the lower level of the vault to be used by someone who has been accidentally locked in.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor security reasons, no visitors are allowed inside the depository grounds. This policy has been enforced ever since the vault opened, with only two exceptions. The first was an inspection by members of the United States Congress and the news media on September 23, 1974 led by then Director of the United States Mint, Mary Brooks.[7] The second was a similar inspection made by Kentucky Congressmen on August 21, 2017, led by Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  November?2017[update], Fort Knox holdings are 4,582 metric tons (147.3 million oz. troy), with a market value of over $100 billion.[13] In contrast, the GDP of the United States was $19.4 trillion as of April 2017.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the gold in the depository is in the form of monetary gold coins.[13] The 1933 Double Eagle was also a temporary resident after transfer from 7 World Trade Center in July 2001, until its sale in July 2002 for $7.59 million. Sometime in 2004, ten additional allegedly stolen 1933 Double Eagles were transported to Fort Knox for safekeeping.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all the gold bars held in the depository are of exactly the same composition. The mint gold bars are nearly pure gold. Bars made from melted gold coins, called \\"coin bars\\", are the same composition as the original coins, which is 90% gold. Unlike many .999 fine gold bullion coins minted in modern times for holding today, the coin alloy for pre-1933 US coins, which were intended for circulation, was a tougher and wear-resistant .900 fine alloy (balance copper) used for all US gold coins since 1837. (See crown gold for further gold coin alloy history.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US holds more gold than any other country, with about 8,133 metric tons in total (not just at Fort Knox), or about 2.4 times that of the next leading country, Germany (which in 2014 owned 3,387.1 metric tons).[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSamsung Knox, an enterprise mobile security solution developed by Samsung Group is named after Fort Knox.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Depository figures prominently as the focus of the villain's plot in the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger. Auric Goldfinger's goal is to break into the Depository and plant an atomic device. When it explodes, the entire US gold supply will be irradiated for decades to come and the worth of Goldfinger's own personal gold supply will skyrocket, making Goldfinger richer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depository is also featured in the finale of the 1952 Bugs Bunny cartoon \\"14  Carrot Rabbit.\\"","field3":"How much gold is there in fort knox?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"The Empire Strikes Back","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Frank Oz (lead puppeteer, Episodes I, VÿVI, VIII)\\r\\nDeep Roy (costume, uncredited, Episode V)[1][2][3][4]\\r\\nWarwick Davis (costume, uncredited, Episode I)\\r\\nGrand Master of the Jedi Order (Episodes I-VI)\\r\\nMember of the High Jedi Council (Episodes I-III)\\r\\nYoda is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas, first appearing in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back. In the original films, he trains Luke Skywalker to fight against the Galactic Empire. In the prequel films, he serves as the Grand Master of the Jedi Order and as a high-ranking general of Clone Troopers in the Clone Wars. Before his death in Return of the Jedi at the age of 900, Yoda was the oldest living character in the Star Wars franchise in canon, until the introduction of Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\\r\\nFrank Oz provided Yoda's voice in each film and used his skills as a puppeteer in the original trilogy and Star Wars: Episode I ÿ The Phantom Menace. For some walking scenes in Episodes V and I, dwarf actors Deep Roy and Warwick Davis appeared in costume as Yoda (though neither was credited). While Frank Oz served as the primary performer, he was assisted by a multitude of other puppeteers, including:[5] Kathryn Mullen (Ep. V), Wendy Froud (Ep. V), David Barclay (Ep. V-VI), Mike Quinn (Ep. VI), David Greenaway (Ep. I & VI), Don Austen (Ep. I), and Kathy Smee (Ep. I). For the radio dramatizations of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Yoda was voiced by John Lithgow, while Tom Kane voiced him in the Clone Wars animated series, several video games, and the series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. George Lucas had originally conceived of Yoda's full name as being \\"Minch Yoda\\" before shortening it.[6]\\r\\nThe make-up artist Stuart Freeborn based Yoda's face partly on his own and partly on Albert Einstein's.[7][8][9][10] In The Phantom Menace, he was redesigned to look younger. He was computer-generated for two distant shots, but remained mostly a puppet.[11] The puppet was re-designed by Nick Dudman from Stuart Freeborn's original design.\\r\\nRendered with computer animation in Star Wars: Episode II ÿ Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III ÿ Revenge of the Sith, Yoda appeared in ways not previously possible, including his participation in elaborate fight scenes. In Revenge of the Sith, his face appears in several big close-ups, demanding highly detailed CGI work. His performance was deliberately designed to be consistent with the limitations of the puppet version, with some \\"mistakes\\" made such as the occasional ear-jiggling.[citation needed] Rob Coleman was responsible for the character's new incarnation to the series.\\r\\nYoda was recreated in CGI for the 2011 Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace.[12] A clip of the new CG Yoda from The Phantom Menace was first seen in the featurette The Chosen One, included in the 2005 DVD release of Revenge of the Sith.[13] The 2012 theatrical 3D release of The Phantom Menace also features the CG version of Yoda.\\r\\nJedi Grand Master Yoda is amongst the oldest, stoic and most powerful known Jedi Masters in the Star Wars universe. Series creator George Lucas opted to have many details of the character's life history remain unknown. Yoda's race and home world have not been named in any official media, canonical or otherwise, and he is merely said to be of a \\"species unknown\\" by the Star Wars Databank. Yoda's characteristic speech patterns have been analyzed and discussed by academic syntacticians, who found it somewhat inconsistent, but could extrapolate that it has objectÿsubjectÿverb word order[14] making it an anastrophe.\\r\\nThe films and expanded universe reveal that he had a hand in training almost every Jedi Master in the galaxy, including Count Dooku, who is identified in Attack of the Clones as Yoda's old Padawan Learner; Mace Windu; Obi-Wan Kenobi (partially, before Qui-Gon Jinn takes over as Obi-Wan's master);[citation needed] Ki-Adi-Mundi, Kit Fisto and eventually Luke Skywalker. During the animated series Star Wars: Clone Wars, set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, he mentions that he trained another one of the leaders on the Jedi Council, Master Oppo Rancisis. In the Star Wars prequel films, he instructs several younglings in the Jedi Temple before they are assigned to a master. This was displayed in a scene in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. In The Empire Strikes Back he mentioned that he had been training Jedi \\"for 800 years\\", which means he must have been a Master Jedi for quite some time before that.\\r\\nYoda makes his first film appearance in The Empire Strikes Back. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) arrives on Dagobah to seek his guidance, having been instructed to do so by the Force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness).\\r\\nYoda does not initially identify himself to Luke and instead tests his patience by presenting himself as a comical and senile backwater individual, deliberately provoking both Luke and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). Luke is shocked when he finally realizes that this small, elderly creature is the powerful Jedi Master he was seeking. Finding that Luke has the same anger and recklessness which caused his father's downfall, Yoda is reluctant to teach him in the ways of the Force, and agrees only at Obi-Wan's behest. Before finishing his training, however, Luke chooses to leave Dagobah in order to confront Darth Vader and save his friends at Bespin. Yoda and Obi-Wan warn him that he is not ready to face Vader and is being lured into a trap, but Luke leaves anyway, promising to return. When Obi-Wan laments that Luke is their \\"last hope,\\" Yoda reminds him that \\"there is another\\".\\r\\nYoda makes a brief appearance in Return of the Jedi, set a year after The Empire Strikes Back. Yoda, now sick and frail, informs Luke that he has completed his training but will not be a Jedi until he confronts Darth Vader; he also confirms that Vader is Luke's father, something Vader had told Luke in the previous film. Yoda then peacefully dies at the age of 900, his body disappearing as he becomes \\"one with the Force\\". He leaves Luke with the knowledge that \\"there is another Skywalker\\". Moments later, Obi-Wan's ghost helps Luke come to the realization that the \\"other\\" of whom Yoda spoke is Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), who is his twin sister.\\r\\nIn the film's final scene, after the Empire has been defeated, Luke sees Yoda's spirit looking upon him with pride, alongside Obi-Wan and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker (Vader's former Jedi self).[15]\\r\\nYoda returns as a younger version of himself in the prequel trilogy beginning with The Phantom Menace. The film marked the final time Oz would portray the character as a puppet. However, in the 2011 Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace, the Yoda puppet was replaced by a CGI character to match the later depiction of the character. In the film, which is set 35 years before The Empire Strikes Back, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) brings the young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) to the Jedi Council. Qui-Gon is convinced that Anakin is the \\"Chosen One\\" of Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force, and requests the boy be trained as a Jedi. Yoda senses great fear in Anakin, especially in regards to his attachment to his mother, and foresees \\"grave danger\\" in his training. The Council, led at the time by Yoda's former padawan Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), rejects Qui-Gon's request.\\r\\nWhen Qui-Gon is mortally wounded in a duel with Sith Lord Darth Maul (played by Ray Park and voiced by Peter Serafinowicz), his dying request to his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is that Anakin be trained as a Jedi. Obi-Wan, determined to fulfill his promise to his master, tells Yoda that he will train the boy, even without the Council's approval. Yoda makes Obi-Wan a Jedi Knight, and reluctantly gives his blessing to Anakin's training.[16]\\r\\nYoda makes his first CGI appearance in Attack of the Clones. Set a decade after The Phantom Menace, Yoda, now in direct control of the Order's policy as Master of the High Council in addition to his traditional position as Grandmaster, is one of the many Jedi who are concerned about the emergence of the Separatists, a group of systems rebelling against the Galactic Republic. After the first attempted assassination of Senator Padm Amidala (Natalie Portman), Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) \\"suggests\\" that she be put under the protection of Obi-Wan, who is training Anakin (now played by Hayden Christensen). At the climax of the film, Yoda arrives in time to save Obi-Wan and Anakin from the Separatists and defeats his former apprentice, Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), in a lightsaber duel.\\r\\nIn Revenge of the Sith, Yoda leads the Jedi Council in pursuing the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Palpatine has by now amassed near-dictatorial emergency powers, and begins interfering in Jedi affairs by appointing Anakin as his personal representative on the Council. The Council grants Anakin a Council seat, but denies him the rank of Master, feeling that doing so would amount to giving Palpatine a vote in the Council. Additionally, they order him to spy on Palpatine, whom Anakin considers a friend and mentor. Confused and angered by the perceived snub and the instructions to commit what he believes to be treason, Anakin continues to lose faith in the Jedi Order.\\r\\nAnakin seeks Yoda's counsel about his prophetic visions that someone close to him will die. Yoda, unaware of the person Anakin speaks of is Padm, or that she is Anakin's wife and pregnant with his child, tells him to \\"train himself to let go of everything that he fears to lose\\". Unsatisfied, Anakin turns to Palpatine, who then reveals himself as Darth Sidious. Palpatine manipulates the young Jedi into becoming his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader, with the promise that the dark side holds the power to save Padm from dying in childbirth.\\r\\nPalpatine later transforms the Republic into the tyrannical Galactic Empire, proclaiming himself emperor for life, and orders the clone troopers to kill their Jedi generals. At this time, Yoda is on Kashyyyk, overseeing the battle between the Separatist forces and a combined command of clone troopers and Wookiees. Through the Force, Yoda feels the deaths of each of the Jedi as they are assassinated by their own troops. After swiftly killing the clone troopers instructed to kill him, he escapes with Wookiee leaders Tarfful and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and returns to Coruscant, where he and Obi-Wan fight their way into the Jedi Temple to stop a trap for all surviving Jedi. Inside, they discover that all the Jedi inside, younglings included, have been slaughtered. They then discover a holographic recording, revealing Vader as the assassin. Yoda decides to face Palpatine, sending Obi-Wan to kill Vader. When Obi-Wan protests, Yoda tells him that the Anakin he knew no longer exists, having been \\"consumed by Darth Vader\\".\\r\\nSubsequently, Yoda battles Palpatine in a lightsaber duel that wrecks the Senate Rotunda. In the end, neither is able to overcome the other and Yoda is forced to retreat. He goes into exile on Dagobah so that he may hide from the Empire and wait for another opportunity to destroy the Sith. At the end of the film, it was revealed that Yoda has been in contact with Qui-Gon's spirit, learning the secret of immortality from him and passing it on to Obi-Wan.\\r\\nYoda is also instrumental in deciding the fate of the Skywalker children after Padm dies in childbirth, recommending that Luke and Leia be hidden from Vader and Palpatine in remote locations. Other than the ancient Jedi Master, only the Organas, the Lars family, R2-D2 and Obi-Wan know of their true identities.[17]\\r\\nIn The Force Awakens, set 30 years after Return of the Jedi, Yoda's voice is heard by the young scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) after she discovers Luke Skywalker's lightsaber.[18]\\r\\nIn Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Yoda appears to Luke as a force ghost as Luke debates whether to burn down the tree storing the only remaining copies of the Sacred Texts of the Jedi. As Luke makes his way to the tree, Yoda appears behind him and talks to Luke about the inner conflicts going on inside him and reminds him that a Jedi must always be sure of his path. When Luke decides against burning down the tree and destroying the texts, Yoda summons a lightning bolt down upon the tree, setting it ablaze while Luke steps back in horror at the sight of the texts seemingly being lost forever (unaware that Rey had taken them earlier as she left the island.) When confronting Yoda as to why he did it, Yoda tells Luke that the true Jedi knowledge is within Jedi themselves and it is their responsibility, not books, to pass that knowledge on and continue the way of the Jedi. As Luke takes in the message, he sits with Yoda and shares a quiet moment with his former master.\\r\\nUnlike in the later prequels, where fight scenes necessitated the character be rendered in with computer-generated imagery, Yoda is once more portrayed using puppetry.\\r\\nYoda appears in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, voiced by Tom Kane. In the prequel film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Yoda assigns Anakin Skywalker his own Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, as he believes that she will help Anakin grow as a Jedi and as a person. Throughout most of the series, Yoda spends his time on Coruscant with the Jedi Council, but he occasionally leaves for certain tasks, such as negotiations with King Katuunko on Rugosa, and a confrontation with Asajj Ventress' droid army. Yoda also watches over Anakin and Ahsoka throughout the series, pleased that they are both maturing due to each other's influence. However, in the final arc of season five, Ahsoka is framed for a crime she didn't commit, and Yoda and the Jedi Council expel her, at the demand of Admiral Tarkin, and turn her over to the Republic military. Along with other members of the Council, Yoda observes Ahsoka's trial, but Anakin bursts in with the true culprit, Barriss Offee, before the verdict can be read. Afterwards Yoda, Anakin and the Council personally invite Ahsoka to rejoin the Order, but to their shock, she refuses and leaves. According to Dave Filoni, Yoda blames himself for Ahsoka's departure, as he had made her Anakin's padawan in the first place.\\r\\nIn the final arc of the final season, Yoda hears Qui-Gon Jinn speaking to him from beyond the grave. Yoda flees the Jedi Temple with R2-D2 to travel to Dagobah, the planet he would make his home when he enters exile after events of Revenge of the Sith, to find answers. Shown cryptic visions of the fall of the Jedi, Yoda learns he has been \\"chosen\\" to learn how to manifest his consciousness after death as a Force ghost. Yoda is tested by a group of spirit priestesses in order to overcome trials and temptations on his pilgrimage; one of these tests is to face an illusion of ancient Sith lord Darth Bane. Yoda's final test is to resist an attempt by Darth Sidious and Dooku to lure him to the dark side with a false vision of deceased Jedi Master Sifo Dyas. Yoda engages in a metaphysical battle with Sidious, and appears to sacrifice his life in order to save Anakin's - only to awaken and discover that the battle was merely a vision, and that he has passed the test. The priestesses inform Yoda that his training will resume in time.\\r\\nYoda was heard in the Star Wars Rebels episode \\"Path of the Jedi\\" with Frank Oz reprising the role for the first time since Revenge of the Sith.[19] He communicates with Padawan Ezra Bridger and his master Kanan Jarrus during their experience in an ancient temple on Lothal, and helps the pair do some soul-searching to analyze their true motivations. He appears physically for the first time, in the season 2 episode \\"Shroud of Darkness\\", in which he tells Ezra he should find Malachor and reunites with Ahsoka after nearly 20 years.\\r\\nWith the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.[20][21][22]\\r\\nYoda appears in the 2003 Cartoon Network animated television series Star Wars: Clone Wars, voiced by Tom Kane. In the show, Yoda is made a General, like many of the Jedi Knights and Masters. Yoda escorts Padm on their journey to an unspecified planet, but Yoda senses several Jedi in distress on Ilum. Using the Jedi mind trick to convince Captain Typho to take them to Ilum, Yoda saves two Jedi Knights and finds a message from Count Dooku giving orders to destroy the Jedi Temple on Ilum. In the animated series' final episode, Yoda fights side by side with Mace Windu to defend Coruscant, which is under attack from the Separatists. The two Jedi Masters realize too late that the battle is a distraction; Separatist leader General Grievous truly intends to kidnap Palpatine. The Jedi Master's effort to stop Grievous fails, and Palpatine is taken hostage, thus setting the stage for Revenge of the Sith.\\r\\nYoda acts as a supporting character in Dark Horse Comics' Clone Wars tie-in comic books. He is also an important character in several novels set in the Star Wars universe, particularly Yoda: Dark Rendezvous.\\r\\nIn 2007, Yoda was selected by Empire magazine as the \\"25th greatest movie character of all time\\".[23] On their list of the 100 Greatest Fictional Characters, Fandomania.com ranked Yoda at number 60.[24]\\r\\nYoda also appears in Disney's Star Tours: The Adventures Continue attraction, where he is voiced by his original voice actor, Frank Oz.[25]\\r\\nA life-size statue of Yoda greets visitors to Lucasfilm's Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco's Presidio, the headquarters of Industrial Light and Magic.\\r\\nAmerican musician and parody artist \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic used the character as inspiration for a parody of The Kinks' \\"Lola\\", in a song entitled \\"Yoda.\\"\\r\\nA Queen Mary University of London linguist claims Yoda's language resembles Hawaiian the most.[26]\\r\\nWorks cited","field3":"What star wars movie does yoda first appear in?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Rolls Royce","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nJay Gatsby (originally named James \\"Jimmy\\" Gatz) is the title character of the 1925 F. Scott Fitzgerald novel The Great Gatsby. The character, a millionaire and the owner of a luxurious mansion where extravagant parties are often hosted, is described by the novel's narrator, Nick Carraway, as being \\"the single most hopeful person I've ever met\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Gatz hails from rural North Dakota,[1] and was born into a poor farmer family. He attended St. Olaf College but dropped out a few weeks into his first semester because he hated supporting himself by working as a janitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dropping out, he went to Lake Superior, where he met copper tycoon Dan Cody in Little Girl Bay. Cody became Gatz's mentor and invited him to join his ten-year yacht trek. At seventeen, Gatz changed his name to Jay Gatsby and, over the next five years, learned the ways of the wealthy. Cody left Gatsby $25,000 in his will, but after his death, Cody's mistress cheated Gatsby out of the inheritance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1917, during his training for the infantry in World War I, 27-year-old Gatsby met and fell in love with 18-year-old debutante Daisy Fay, who was everything Gatsby was not: rich and from a patrician Louisville family.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the war, Gatsby reached the rank of Major in the U.S. 16th Infantry Regiment, and was decorated for valor for his participation in the Marne and the Argonne. After the war (as he also tells Nick Carraway years later), he briefly attended Trinity College, Oxford.[2][3] While there, he received a letter from Daisy, telling him that she had married the wealthy Tom Buchanan. Gatsby then decided to commit his life to becoming a man of the kind of wealth and stature he believed would win Daisy's love.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nGatsby returned home and settled in New York, which was being transformed by the Jazz Age. It is speculated, but never confirmed, that Gatsby took advantage of Prohibition by making a fortune from bootlegging and built connections with various gangsters such as Meyer Wolfsheim (who Gatsby claims is \\"the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his vast income, Gatsby purchased a mansion in the fictional West Egg (a reference to Great Neck or perhaps Kings Point) of Long Island. West Egg lies on the opposite bay from old-money East Egg (a reference to Sands Point), where Daisy, Tom, and their three-year-old daughter Pammy live. At his West Egg mansion, Gatsby hosts elaborate parties every weekend, open to all comers, in an attempt to attract Daisy as a party guest. Through Daisy's cousin Nick Carraway, Gatsby finally has a chance to reunite with her. Gatsby does not reveal to Daisy or to Nick the truth of how he came to acquire his wealth. During several meetings, Gatsby tries to revive his relationship with Daisy to what had been five years ago. He seeks to woo her with his wealth and asks her to leave her boorish, faithless husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Buchanan home, Jordan Baker, Nick, Jay, and the Buchanans decide to visit New York City. Tom borrows Gatsby's yellow Rolls Royce to drive up to the city. On the way to New York City, Tom makes a detour at a gas station in \\"the Valley of Ashes\\", a run-down part of Long Island. The owner, George Wilson, shares his concern that his wife, Myrtle, may be having an affair. This unnerves Tom, who has been having an affair with Myrtle, and he leaves in a hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the party in an expensive hotel suite, the casual conversation evolves into a confrontation between Daisy, Gatsby and Tom. In a fit of anger, Gatsby insists that Daisy always loved him, not Tom, and that she only married Tom for his money. Daisy admits she loved both Tom and Gatsby. The party then breaks up, with Daisy driving Gatsby out of New York City in the yellow Rolls-Royce and Tom leaving with Daisy's friend Jordan Baker and Nick in Tom's car.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom her upstairs room at the gas station, Myrtle sees an approaching car. Mistakenly believing Tom has returned for her, she runs out towards the car, but is struck and killed instantly. Panicked, Daisy drives away from the scene of the accident. At Daisy's house in East Egg, Gatsby promises Daisy he would take the blame if they are ever caught.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom tells George that it was Gatsby's car that killed Myrtle. George goes to Gatsby's house in West Egg, where he shoots and kills Gatsby before committing suicide. Gatsby is later found dead, floating in his pool.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the many guests who attended Gatsby's parties, only one (an individual known as \\"Owl Eyes\\") attends his funeral. Also at the funeral are Nick Carraway and Gatsby's father, Henry C. Gatz, who states that he was proud of his son's achievement as a self-made millionaire.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure of Jay Gatsby became a cultural touchstone in 20th century America. When the poor native son Gatsby tells Nick Carraway, his only true friend and a relative of Daisy's, he was brought up wealthy and that he attended Oxford because \\"all my ancestors have been educated there\\", MSNBC political commentator Chris Matthews sees him as the eternal American striver: \\"Gatsby needed more than money: he needed to be someone who had always had it..... this blind faith that he can retrofit his very existence to Daisy's specifications is the heart and soul of The Great Gatsby. It's the classic story of the fresh start, the second chance.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Jay Gatsby..... appears to be the quintessential American male hero.

In a story on R.

Warner Baxter first played the role in the lost 1926 silent film. Gatsby was later portrayed by Alan Ladd in the 1949 film adaptation, Robert Redford in the 1974 film adaptation, Leonardo DiCaprio in director Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation, and Gregg Sulkin (as \\"Dylan Carson\\") in Kevin Asch's 2014 drama film Affluenza, billed as a loose re-telling of the novel set among a group of rich and privileged teenagers in Long Island before the 2008 financial crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nToby Stephens played Gatsby in the 2000 television adaptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Burns is heavily based on Gatsby in The Simpsons episode \\"The Great Phatsby\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nKirk Douglas starred as Gatsby in an adaptation broadcast on CBS' Family Hour of Stars on January 1, 1950.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew Scott played Gatsby in the 2012 two-part BBC Radio 4 Classic Serial production.[12]","field3":"What kind of car does jay gatsby drive?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"a varying selection of religious and magical texts","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Book of the Dead is an ancient Egyptian funerary text, used from the beginning of the New Kingdom (around 1550 BCE) to around 50 BCE.[1] The original Egyptian name for the text, transliterated rw nw prt m hrw[2] is translated as Book of Coming Forth by Day.[3] Another translation would be Book of Emerging Forth into the Light. \\"Book\\" is the closest term to describe the loose collection of texts[4] consisting of a number of magic spells intended to assist a dead person's journey through the Duat, or underworld, and into the afterlife and written by many priests over a period of about 1000 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Book of the Dead was part of a tradition of funerary texts which includes the earlier Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts, which were painted onto objects, not papyrus. Some of the spells included were drawn from these older works and date to the 3rd millennium BCE. Other spells were composed later in Egyptian history, dating to the Third Intermediate Period (11th to 7th centuries BCE). A number of the spells which made up the Book continued to be inscribed on tomb walls and sarcophagi, as had always been the spells from which they originated. The Book of the Dead was placed in the coffin or burial chamber of the deceased.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no single or canonical Book of the Dead. The surviving papyri contain a varying selection of religious and magical texts and vary considerably in their illustration. Some people seem to have commissioned their own copies of the Book of the Dead, perhaps choosing the spells they thought most vital in their own progression to the afterlife. The Book of the Dead was most commonly written in hieroglyphic or hieratic script on a papyrus scroll, and often illustrated with vignettes depicting the deceased and their journey into the afterlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Book of the Dead developed from a tradition of funerary manuscripts dating back to the Egyptian Old Kingdom. The first funerary texts were the Pyramid Texts, first used in the Pyramid of King Unas of the 5th dynasty, around 2400 BCE.[5] These texts were written on the walls of the burial chambers within pyramids, and were exclusively for the use of the Pharaoh (and, from the 6th dynasty, the Queen). The Pyramid Texts were written in an unusual hieroglyphic style; many of the hieroglyphs representing humans or animals were left incomplete or drawn mutilated, most likely to prevent them causing any harm to the dead pharaoh.[6] The purpose of the Pyramid Texts was to help the dead King take his place amongst the gods, in particular to reunite him with his divine father Ra; at this period the afterlife was seen as being in the sky, rather than the underworld described in the Book of the Dead.[6] Towards the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramid Texts ceased to be an exclusively royal privilege, and were adopted by regional governors and other high-ranking officials.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Middle Kingdom, a new funerary text emerged, the Coffin Texts. The Coffin Texts used a newer version of the language, new spells, and included illustrations for the first time. The Coffin Texts were most commonly written on the inner surfaces of coffins, though they are occasionally found on tomb walls or on papyri.[6] The Coffin Texts were available to wealthy private individuals, vastly increasing the number of people who could expect to participate in the afterlife; a process which has been described as the \\"democratization of the afterlife\\".[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Book of the Dead first developed in Thebes toward the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period, around 1700 BCE. The earliest known occurrence of the spells included in the Book of the Dead is from the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep, of the 13th dynasty, where the new spells were included amongst older texts known from the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts. Some of the spells introduced at this time claim an older provenance; for instance the rubric to spell 30B states that it was discovered by the Prince Hordjedef in the reign of King Menkaure, many hundreds of years before it is attested in the archaeological record.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 17th dynasty, the Book of the Dead had become widespread not only for members of the royal family, but courtiers and other officials as well. At this stage, the spells were typically inscribed on linen shrouds wrapped around the dead, though occasionally they are found written on coffins or on papyrus.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Kingdom saw the Book of the Dead develop and spread further. The famous Spell 125, the 'Weighing of the Heart', is first known from the reign of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, c.1475 BCE. From this period onward the Book of the Dead was typically written on a papyrus scroll, and the text illustrated with vignettes. During the 19th dynasty in particular, the vignettes tended to be lavish, sometimes at the expense of the surrounding text.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Third Intermediate Period, the Book of the Dead started to appear in hieratic script, as well as in the traditional hieroglyphics. The hieratic scrolls were a cheaper version, lacking illustration apart from a single vignette at the beginning, and were produced on smaller papyri. At the same time, many burials used additional funerary texts, for instance the Amduat.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 25th and 26th dynasties, the Book of the Dead was updated, revised and standardised. Spells were consistently ordered and numbered for the first time. This standardised version is known today as the 'Saite recension', after the Saite (26th) dynasty. In the Late period and Ptolemaic period, the Book of the Dead remained based on the Saite recension, though increasingly abbreviated towards the end of the Ptolemaic period. New funerary texts appeared, including the Book of Breathing and Book of Traversing Eternity. The last use of the Book of the Dead was in the 1st century BCE, though some artistic motifs drawn from it were still in use in Roman times.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Book of the Dead is made up of a number of individual texts and their accompanying illustrations. Most sub-texts begin with the word ro, which can mean \\"mouth,\\" \\"speech,\\" \\"spell,\\" \\"utterance,\\" \\"incantation,\\" or \\"a chapter of a book.\\" This ambiguity reflects the similarity in Egyptian thought between ritual speech and magical power.[14] In the context of the Book of the Dead, it is typically translated as either \\"chapter\\" or \\"spell.\\" In this article, the word \\"spell\\" is used.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present, some 192 spells are known,[15] though no single manuscript contains them all. They served a range of purposes. Some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife, or perhaps to identify them with the gods: for instance, Spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god Atum.[16] Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, and to give the deceased control over the world around him. Still others protect the deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch spells as 26 - 30, and sometimes spells 6 and 126, relate to the heart and were inscribed on scarabs.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe texts and images of the Book of the Dead were magical as well as religious. Magic was as legitimate an activity as praying to the gods, even when the magic was aimed at controlling the gods themselves.[18] Indeed, there was little distinction for the Ancient Egyptians between magical and religious practice.[19] The concept of magic (heka) was also intimately linked with the spoken and written word.  The act of speaking a ritual formula was an act of creation;[20] there is a sense in which action and speech were one and the same thing.[19] The magical power of words extended to the written word. Hieroglyphic script was held to have been invented by the god Thoth, and the hieroglyphs themselves were powerful. Written words conveyed the full force of a spell.[20] This was even true when the text was abbreviated or omitted, as often occurred in later Book of the Dead scrolls, particularly if the accompanying images were present.[21] The Egyptians also believed that knowing the name of something gave power over it; thus, the Book of the Dead equips its owner with the mystical names of many of the entities he would encounter in the afterlife, giving him power over them.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spells of the Book of the Dead made use of several magical techniques which can also be seen in other areas of Egyptian life. A number of spells are for magical amulets, which would protect the deceased from harm. In addition to being represented on a Book of the Dead papyrus, these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy.[18] Everyday magic made use of amulets in huge numbers. Other items in direct contact with the body in the tomb, such as headrests, were also considered to have amuletic value.[23] A number of spells also refer to Egyptian beliefs about the magical healing power of saliva.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost every Book of the Dead was unique, containing a different mixture of spells drawn from the corpus of texts available. For most of the history of the Book of the Dead there was no defined order or structure.[24] In fact, until Paul Barguet's 1967 \\"pioneering study\\" of common themes between texts,[25] Egyptologists concluded there was no internal structure at all.[26] It is only from the Saite period (26th dynasty) onwards that there is a defined order.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Books of the Dead from the Saite period tend to organize the Chapters into four sections:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spells in the Book of the Dead depict Egyptian beliefs about the nature of death and the afterlife. The Book of the Dead is a vital source of information about Egyptian beliefs in this area.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne aspect of death was the disintegration of the various kheperu, or modes of existence.[28] Funerary rituals served to re-integrate these different aspects of being. Mummification served to preserve and transform the physical body into sah, an idealised form with divine aspects;[29] the Book of the Dead  contained spells aimed at preserving the body of the deceased, which may have been recited during the process of mummification.[30] The heart, which was regarded as the aspect of being which included intelligence and memory, was also protected with spells, and in case anything happened to the physical heart, it was common to bury jewelled heart scarabs with a body to provide a replacement. The ka, or life-force, remained in the tomb with the dead body, and required sustenance from offerings of food, water and incense. In case priests or relatives failed to provide these offerings, Spell 105 ensured the ka was satisfied.[31] The name of the dead person, which constituted their individuality and was required for their continued existence, was written in many places throughout the Book, and spell 25 ensured the deceased would remember their own name.[32] The ba was a free-ranging spirit aspect of the deceased. It was the ba, depicted as a human-headed bird, which could \\"go forth by day\\" from the tomb into the world; spells 61 and 89 acted to preserve it.[33] Finally, the shut, or shadow of the deceased, was preserved by spells 91, 92 and 188.[34] If all these aspects of the person could be variously preserved, remembered, and satiated, then the dead person would live on in the form of an akh. An akh was a blessed spirit with magical powers who would dwell among the gods.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nature of the afterlife which the dead person enjoyed is difficult to define, because of the differing traditions within Ancient Egyptian religion. In the Book of the Dead, the dead were taken into the presence of the god Osiris, who was confined to the subterranean Duat. There are also spells to enable the ba or akh of the dead to join Ra as he travelled the sky in his sun-barque, and help him fight off Apep.[36] As well as joining the Gods, the Book of the Dead also depicts the dead living on in the 'Field of Reeds', a paradisiac likeness of the real world.[37] The Field of Reeds is depicted as a lush, plentiful version of the Egypt of the living. There are fields, crops, oxen, people and waterways. The deceased person is shown encountering the Great Ennead, a group of gods, as well as his or her own parents. While the depiction of the Field of Reeds is pleasant and plentiful, it is also clear that manual labour is required. For this reason burials included a number of statuettes named shabti, or later ushebti. These statuettes were inscribed with a spell, also included in the Book of the Dead, requiring them to undertake any manual labour that might be the owner's duty in the afterlife.[38] It is also clear that the dead not only went to a place where the gods lived, but that they acquired divine characteristics themselves. In many occasions, the deceased is mentioned as \\"The Osiris ÿ [Name]\\" in the Book of the Dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe path to the afterlife as laid out in the Book of the Dead was a difficult one. The deceased was required to pass a series of gates, caverns and mounds guarded by supernatural creatures.[40] These terrifying entities were armed with enormous knives and are illustrated in grotesque forms, typically as human figures with the heads of animals or combinations of different ferocious beasts. Their namesfor instance, \\"He who lives on snakes\\" or \\"He who dances in blood\\"are equally grotesque. These creatures had to be pacified by reciting the appropriate spells included in the Book of the Dead; once pacified they posed no further threat, and could even extend their protection to the dead person.[41] Another breed of supernatural creatures was 'slaughterers' who killed the unrighteous on behalf of Osiris; the Book of the Dead equipped its owner to escape their attentions.[42]  As well as these supernatural entities, there were also threats from natural or supernatural animals, including crocodiles, snakes, and beetles.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf all the obstacles of the Duat could be negotiated, the deceased would be judged in the \\"Weighing of the Heart\\" ritual, depicted in Spell 125. The deceased was led by the god Anubis into the presence of Osiris. There, the dead person swore that he had not committed any sin from a list of 42 sins,[44] reciting a text known as the \\"Negative Confession\\". Then the dead person's heart was weighed on a pair of scales, against the goddess Maat, who embodied truth and justice. Maat was often represented by an ostrich feather, the hieroglyphic sign for her name.[45] At this point, there was a risk that the deceased's heart would bear witness, owning up to sins committed in life; Spell 30B guarded against this eventuality. If the scales balanced, this meant the deceased had led a good life. Anubis would take them to Osiris and they would find their place in the afterlife, becoming maa-kheru, meaning \\"vindicated\\" or \\"true of voice\\".[46] If the heart was out of balance with Maat, then another fearsome beast called Ammit, the Devourer, stood ready to eat it and put the dead person's afterlife to an early and unpleasant end.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis scene is remarkable not only for its vividness but as one of the few parts of the Book of the Dead with any explicit moral content. The judgment of the dead and the Negative Confession were a representation of the conventional moral code which governed Egyptian society. For every \\"I have not...\\" in the Negative Confession, it is possible to read an unexpressed \\"Thou shalt not\\".[48] While the Ten Commandments of Judeo-Christian ethics are rules of conduct laid down by a perceived divine revelation, the Negative Confession is more a divine enforcement of everyday morality.[49]  Views differ among Egyptologists about how far the Negative Confession represents a moral absolute, with ethical purity being necessary for progress to the Afterlife. John Taylor points out the wording of Spells 30B and 125 suggests a pragmatic approach to morality; by preventing the heart from contradicting him with any inconvenient truths, it seems that the deceased could enter the afterlife even if their life had not been entirely pure.[47] Ogden Goelet says \\"without an exemplary and moral existence, there was no hope for a successful afterlife\\",[48] while Geraldine Pinch suggests that the Negative Confession is essentially similar to the spells protecting from demons, and that the success of the Weighing of the Heart depended on the mystical knowledge of the true names of the judges rather than on the deceased's moral behaviour.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Book of the Dead papyrus was produced to order by scribes. They were commissioned by people in preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives the price of a Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver,[51] perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer.[52] Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost owners of the Book of the Dead were evidently part of the social elite; they were initially reserved for the royal family, but later papyri are found in the tombs of scribes, priests and officials. Most owners were men, and generally the vignettes included the owner's wife as well. Towards the beginning of the history of the Book of the Dead, there are roughly 10 copies belonging to men for every one for a woman. However, during the Third Intermediate Period, 2/3 were for women; and women owned roughly a third of the hieratic paypri from the Late and Ptolemaic Periods.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dimensions of a Book of the Dead could vary widely; the longest is 40m long while some are as short as 1m. They are composed of sheets of papyrus joined together, the individual papyri varying in width from 15?cm to 45?cm. The scribes working on Book of the Dead papyri took more care over their work than those working on more mundane texts; care was taken to frame the text within margins, and to avoid writing on the joints between sheets. The words peret em heru, or 'coming forth by day' sometimes appear on the reverse of the outer margin, perhaps acting as a label.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nBooks were often prefabricated in funerary workshops, with spaces being left for the name of the deceased to be written in later.[55] For instance, in the Papyrus of Ani, the name \\"Ani\\" appears at the top or bottom of a column, or immediately following a rubric introducing him as the speaker of a block of text; the name appears in a different handwriting to the rest of the manuscript, and in some places is mis-spelt or omitted entirely.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe text of a New Kingdom Book of the Dead was typically written in cursive hieroglyphs, most often from left to right, but also sometimes from right to left. The hieroglyphs were in columns, which were separated by black lines ÿ a similar arrangement to that used when hieroglyphs were carved on tomb walls or monuments. Illustrations were put in frames above, below, or between the columns of text. The largest illustrations took up a full page of papyrus.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 21st Dynasty onward, more copies of the Book of the Dead are found in hieratic script. The calligraphy is similar to that of other hieratic manuscripts of the New Kingdom; the text is written in horizontal lines across wide columns (often the column size corresponds to the size of the papyrus sheets of which a scroll is made up). Occasionally a hieratic Book of the Dead contains captions in hieroglyphic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe text of a Book of the Dead was written in both black and red ink, regardless of whether it was in hieroglyphic or hieratic script. Most of the text was in black, with red ink used for the titles of spells, opening and closing sections of spells, the instructions to perform spells correctly in rituals, and also for the names of dangerous creatures such as the demon Apep.[57] The black ink used was based on carbon, and the red ink on ochre, in both cases mixed with water.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe style and nature of the vignettes used to illustrate a Book of the Dead varies widely. Some contain lavish colour illustrations, even making use of gold leaf. Others contain only line drawings, or one simple illustration at the opening.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nBook of the Dead papyri were often the work of several different scribes and artists whose work was literally pasted together.[53] It is usually possible to identify the style of more than one scribe used on a given manuscript, even when the manuscript is a shorter one.[60] The text and illustrations were produced by different scribes; there are a number of Books where the text was completed but the illustrations were left empty.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe existence of the Book of the Dead was known as early as the Middle Ages, well before its contents could be understood. Since it was found in tombs, it was evidently a document of a religious nature, and this led to the widespread misapprehension that the Book of the Dead was the equivalent of a Bible or Qur'an.[62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1842 Karl Richard Lepsius published a translation of a manuscript dated to the Ptolemaic era and coined the name \\"Book of The Dead\\" (das Todtenbuch). He also introduced the spell numbering system which is still in use, identifying 165 different spells.[15] Lepsius promoted the idea of a comparative edition of the Book of the Dead, drawing on all relevant manuscripts. This project was undertaken by douard Naville, starting in 1875 and completed in 1886, producing a three-volume work including a selection of vignettes for every one of the 186 spells he worked with, the more significant variations of the text for every spell, and commentary. In 1867 Samuel Birch of the British Museum published the first extensive English translation.[64] In 1876 he published a photographic copy of the Papyrus of Nebseny.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work of E. A. Wallis Budge, Birch's successor at the British Museum, is still in wide circulation ÿ including both his hieroglyphic editions and his English translations of the Papyrus of Ani, though the latter are now considered inaccurate and out-of-date.[66] More recent translations in English have been published by T. G. Allen (1974) and Raymond O. Faulkner (1972).[67] As more work has been done on the Book of the Dead, more spells have been identified, and the total now stands at 192.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1970s, Ursula R??ler-K?hler at the University of Bonn began a working group to develop the history of Book of the Dead texts.  This later received sponsorship from the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the German Research Foundation, in 2004 coming under the auspices of the German Academies of Sciences and Arts.  Today the Book of the Dead Project, as it is called, maintains a database of documentation and photography covering 80% of extant copies and fragments from the corpus of Book of the Dead texts, and provides current services to Egyptologists.[68]  It is housed at the University of Bonn, with much material available online.[69] Affiliated scholars are authoring a series of monograph studies, the Studien zum Alt?gyptischen Totenbuch, alongside a series that publishes the manuscripts themselves, Handschriften des Alt?gyptischen Totenbuches.[70]  Both are in print by Harrassowitz Verlag.  Orientverlag has released another series of related monographs, Totenbuchtexte, focused on analysis, synoptic comparison, and textual criticism.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch work on the Book of the Dead has always posed technical difficulties thanks to the need to copy very long hieroglyphic texts. Initially, these were copied out by hand, with the assistance either of tracing paper or a camera lucida. In the mid-19th century, hieroglyphic fonts became available and made lithographic reproduction of manuscripts more feasible. In the present day, hieroglyphics can be rendered in desktop publishing software and this, combined with digital print technology, means that the costs of publishing a Book of the Dead may be considerably reduced. However, a very large amount of the source material in museums around the world remains unpublished.[71]","field3":"What does the egyptian book of the dead contain?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Koronadal Commercial Corporation (KCC)","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"KCC Mall de Zamboanga is the third KCC Mall in the Philippines.

Late in the century, all used optical fiber, and most now use optical amplifiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid in 1858 by businessman Cyrus West Field, it operated for only three weeks; subsequent attempts in 1865 and 1866 were more successful.[1]  Although a telephone cable was discussed starting in the 1920s[citation needed], to be practical it needed a number of technological advances which did not arrive until the 1940s[citation needed]. Starting in 1927, transatlantic telephone service was radio-based.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nTAT-1 (Transatlantic No. 1) was the first transatlantic telephone cable system. It was laid between Gallanach Bay, near Oban, Scotland and Clarenville, Newfoundland between 1955 and 1956 by the cable ship Monarch.[3] It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956, initially carrying 36 telephone channels. In the first 24 hours of public service there were 588 LondonÿU.S. calls and 119 from London to Canada. The capacity of the cable was soon increased to 48 channels. Later, an additional three channels were added by use of C Carrier equipment. Time-assignment speech interpolation (TASI) was implemented on the TAT-1 cable in June 1960 and effectively increased the cable's capacity from 37 (out of 51 available channels) to 72 speech circuits. TAT-1 was finally retired in 1978. Later coaxial cables, installed through the 1970s, used transistors and had higher bandwidth. The MoscowÿWashington hotline was initially connected through this system.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll cables presently in service use fiber optic technology. Many cables terminate in Newfoundland and Ireland, which lie on the great circle route (the shortest route) from London, UK to New York City, USA.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been a succession of newer transatlantic cable systems. All recent systems have used fiber optic transmission, and a self-healing ring topology.  Late in the 20th century, communications satellites lost most of their North Atlantic telephone traffic to these low cost, high capacity, low latency cables.  This advantage only increases over time as tighter cables provide higher speed ÿ the 2012 generation of cables drop the transatlantic latency to under 60 milliseconds, according to Hibernia Atlantic, deploying such a cable that year.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome new cables are being announced on the South Atlantic: SACS (South Atlantic Cable System)[6] and SAex(South Atlantic Express) [7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TAT series of cables constitute a large percentage of all North Atlantic cables. All TAT cables are joint ventures between a number of telecommunications companies, e.g. British Telecom. CANTAT cables terminate in Canada rather than in the USA.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a number of private non-TAT cables.","field3":"When was the first transatlantic telephone cable service opened?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"31 January 1863","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Jules Gabriel Verne (/d?u?lz/[1] /v??rn/;[1][2] French:?[?yl v??n]; 8 February 1828 ÿ 24 March 1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright.\\r\\nVerne was born to bourgeois parents in the seaport of Nantes, where he was trained to follow in his father's footsteps as a lawyer, but quit the profession early in life to write for magazines and the stage. His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the Voyages extraordinaires, a widely popular series of scrupulously researched adventure novels including Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870), and Around the World in Eighty Days (1873).\\r\\nVerne is generally considered a major literary author in France and most of Europe, where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism.[3] His reputation is markedly different in Anglophone regions, where he has often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or children's books, largely because of the highly abridged and altered translations in which his novels are often reprinted.[4]\\r\\nVerne has been the second most-translated author in the world since 1979, ranking between Agatha Christie and William Shakespeare.[5] He has sometimes been called the \\"Father of Science Fiction\\", a title that has also been given to H. G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJules Gabriel Verne was born on 8 February 1828, on ?le Feydeau, a small artificial island on the Loire River within the town of Nantes, in No. 4 Rue de Clisson, the house of his maternal grandmother Dame Sophie Allotte de la Fu?e.[7] His parents were Pierre Verne, an attorney originally from Provins, and Sophie Allote de la Fu?e, a Nantes woman from a local family of navigators and shipowners, of distant Scottish descent.[8][a] In 1829, the Verne family moved some hundred meters away to No. 2 Quai Jean-Bart, where Verne's brother Paul was born the same year. Three sisters, Anna (1836), Mathilde (1839), and Marie (1842) would follow.[8]\\r\\nIn 1834, at the age of six, Verne was sent to boarding school at 5 Place du Bouffay in Nantes. The teacher, Mme Sambin, was the widow of a naval captain who had disappeared some 30 years before.[9] Mme Sambin often told the students that her husband was a shipwrecked castaway and that he would eventually return like Robinson Crusoe from his desert island paradise.[10] The theme of the Robinsonade would stay with Verne throughout his life and appear in many of his novels, including The Mysterious Island (1874), Second Fatherland (1900), and The School for Robinsons (1882).\\r\\nIn 1836, Verne went on to cole Saint?Stanislas, a Catholic school suiting the pious religious tastes of his father. Verne quickly distinguished himself in mmoire (recitation from memory), geography, Greek, Latin, and singing.[11] In the same year, 1836, Pierre Verne bought a vacation house at 29 Rue des Rforms in the village of Chantenay (now part of Nantes) on the Loire River.[12] In his brief memoir \\"Souvenirs denfance et de jeunesse\\" (\\"Memories of Childhood and Youth\\", 1890), Verne recalled a deep fascination with the river and with the many merchant vessels navigating it.[13] He also took vacations at Brains, in the house of his uncle Prudent Allotte, a retired shipowner, who had gone around the world and served as mayor of Brains from 1828 to 1837. Verne took joy in playing interminable rounds of the Game of the Goose with his uncle, and both the game and his uncle's name would be memorialized in two late novels (The Will of an Eccentric (1900) and Robur the Conqueror (1886), respectively).[13][14]\\r\\nLegend has it that in 1839, at the age of 11, Verne secretly procured a spot as cabin boy on the three-mast ship Coralie, with the intention of traveling to the Indies and bringing back a coral necklace for his cousin Caroline. The ship was due to set out for the Indies that evening but stopped first at Paimboeuf, where Pierre Verne arrived just in time to catch his son and make him promise to travel \\"only in his imagination\\".[15] It is now known that the legend is an exaggerated tale invented by Verne's first biographer, his niece Marguerite Allotte de la Fye, though it may have been inspired by a real incident.[16]\\r\\nIn 1840, the Vernes moved again to a large apartment at No. 6 Rue Jean-Jacques-Rousseau, where the family's youngest child, Marie, was born in 1842.[12] In the same year Verne entered another religious school, the Petit Sminaire de Saint-Donatien, as a lay student. His unfinished novel Un prtre en 1839 (A Priest in 1839), written in his teens and the earliest of his prose works to survive,[17] describes the seminary in disparaging terms.[11] From 1844 to 1846, Verne and his brother were enrolled in the Lyce Royal (now the Lyce Georges-Clemenceau) in Nantes. After finishing classes in rhetoric and philosophy, he took the baccalaurat at Rennes and received the grade \\"Fairly good\\" on 29 July 1846.[18]\\r\\nBy 1847, when Verne was 19, he had taken seriously to writing long works in the style of Victor Hugo, beginning Un prtre en 1839 and seeing two verse tragedies, Alexandre VI and La Conspiration des poudres (The Gunpowder Plot), to completion.[17] However, his father took it for granted that Verne, being the firstborn son of the family, would not attempt to make money in literature but would instead inherit the family law practice.[19]\\r\\nIn 1847, Verne's father sent him to Paris, primarily to begin his studies in law school, and secondarily (according to family legend) to distance him temporarily from Nantes.[20][21] His cousin Caroline, with whom he was in love, was married on 27 April 1847, to mile Dezaunay, a man of 40, with whom she would have five children.[22]\\r\\nAfter a short stay in Paris, where he passed first-year law exams, Verne returned to Nantes for his father's help in preparing for the second year (provincial law students were in that era required to go to Paris to take exams).[23] While in Nantes, he met Rose Herminie Arnaud Grossetire, a young woman one year his senior, and fell intensely in love with her. He wrote and dedicated some 30 poems to her, including \\"La Fille de l'air\\" (\\"The Daughter of Air\\"), which describes her as \\"blonde and enchanting / winged and transparent\\".[24] His passion seems to have been reciprocated, at least for a short time,[21] but Grossetire's parents frowned upon the idea of their daughter marrying a young student of uncertain future. They married her instead to Armand Terrien de la Haye, a rich landowner 10 years her senior, on 19 July 1848.[25]\\r\\nThe sudden marriage sent Verne into deep frustration. He wrote a hallucinatory letter to his mother, apparently composed in a state of half-drunkenness, in which under pretext of a dream he described his misery.[26] This requited but aborted love affair seems to have permanently marked the author and his work, and his novels include a significant number of young women married against their will (Grande in \\"Master Zacharius\\" (1854), Sava in Mathias Sandorf (1885), Ellen in A Floating City (1871), etc.), to such an extent that the scholar Christian Chelebourg attributed the recurring theme to a \\"Herminie complex\\".[27] The incident also led Verne to bear a grudge against his birthplace and Nantes society, which he criticized in his poem \\"La sixime ville de France\\" (\\"The Sixth City of France\\").[28][29]\\r\\nIn July 1848, Verne left Nantes again for Paris, where his father intended him to finish law studies and take up law as a profession. He obtained permission from his father to rent a furnished apartment at 24 Rue de l'Ancienne-Comdie, which he shared with douard Bonamy, another student of Nantes origin.[26] (On his 1847 Paris visit, Verne had stayed at 2 Rue Thrse, the house of his aunt Charuel, on the Butte Saint-Roch.)[30]\\r\\nVerne arrived in Paris during a time of political upheaval: the French Revolution of 1848. In February, Louis Philippe I had been overthrown and had fled; on 24 February, a provisional government of the French Second Republic took power, but political demonstrations continued, and social tension remained. In June, barricades went up in Paris, and the government sent Louis-Eugne Cavaignac to crush the insurrection. Verne entered the city shortly before the election of Louis-Napolon Bonaparte as the first president of the Republic, a state of affairs that would last until the French coup of 1851, in which Bonaparte had himself crowned ruler of the Second French Empire. In a letter to his family, Verne described the bombarded state of the city after the recent June Days Uprising but assured them that the anniversary of Bastille Day had gone by without any significant conflict.[31]\\r\\nVerne used his family connections to make an entrance into Paris society. His uncle Francisque de Chataubourg introduced him into literary salons, and Verne particularly frequented those of Mme de Barrre, a friend of his mother's.[32] While continuing his law studies, he fed his passion for the theatre, writing numerous plays. Verne later recalled: \\"I was greatly under the influence of Victor Hugo, indeed, very excited by reading and re-reading his works. At that time I could have recited by heart whole pages of Notre Dame de Paris, but it was his dramatic work that most influenced me.\\"[33] Another source of creative stimulation came from a neighbor: living on the same floor in the Rue de l'Ancienne-Comdie apartment house was a young composer, Aristide Hignard, with whom Verne soon became good friends, and Verne wrote several texts for Hignard to set as chansons.[34]\\r\\nDuring this period, Verne's letters to his parents primarily focused on expenses and on a suddenly appearing series of violent stomach cramps,[35] the first of many he would suffer from during his life. (Modern scholars have hypothesized that he suffered from colitis;[35] Verne believed the illness to have been inherited from his mother's side.)[36] Rumors of an outbreak of cholera in March 1849 exacerbated these medical concerns.[35] Yet another health problem would strike in 1851, when Verne suffered the first of four attacks of facial paralysis. These attacks, rather than being psychosomatic, were due to an inflammation in the middle ear, though this cause remained unknown to Verne during his life. [37]\\r\\nIn the same year, Verne was required to enlist in the French military, but the sortition process spared him, to his great relief. He wrote to his father: \\"You should already know, dear papa, what I think of the military life, and of these domestic servants in livery.  You have to abandon all dignity to perform such functions.\\"[38] Verne's strong antiwar sentiments, to the dismay of his father, would remain steadfast throughout his life.[38]\\r\\nThough writing profusely and frequenting the salons, Verne diligently pursued his law studies and graduated with a licence en droit in January 1851.[39]\\r\\nThanks to his visits to salons, Verne came into contact in 1849 with Alexandre Dumas through the mutual acquaintance of a celebrated chirologist of the time, the Chevalier d'Arpentigny.[39] Verne became close friends with Dumas' son, Alexandre Dumas, fils, and showed him a manuscript for a stage comedy, Les Pailles rompues (The Broken Straws). The two young men revised the play together, and Dumas, through arrangements with his father, had it produced by the Opra-National at the Thatre Historique in Paris, opening on 12 June 1850.[40]\\r\\nIn 1851, Verne met with a fellow writer from Nantes, Pierre-Michel-Fran?ois Chevalier (known as \\"Pitre-Chevalier\\"), the editor-in-chief of the magazine Muse des familles (The Family Museum).[41] Pitre-Chevalier was looking for articles about geography, history, science, and technology, and was keen to make sure that the educational component would be made accessible to large popular audiences using a straightforward prose style or an engaging fictional story. Verne, with his delight in diligent research, especially in geography, was a natural for the job.[42] Verne first offered him a short historical adventure story, \\"The First Ships of the Mexican Navy\\", written in the style of James Fenimore Cooper, whose novels had deeply influenced him.[41] Pitre-Chevalier published it in July 1851, and in the same year published a second short story, \\"A Voyage in a Balloon\\"(August 1851). The latter story, with its combination of adventurous narrative, travel themes, and detailed historical research, would later be described by Verne as \\"the first indication of the line of novel that I was destined to follow.\\"[33]\\r\\nDumas fils put Verne in contact with Jules Seveste, a stage director who had taken over the directorship of the Thatre-Historique and renamed it the Thatre Lyrique. Seveste offered Verne the job of secretary of the theatre, with little or no salary attached.[8] Verne accepted, using the opportunity to write and produce several comic operas written in collaboration with Hignard and the prolific librettist Michel Carr.[43] To celebrate his employment at the Thatre Lyrique, Verne joined with ten friends to found a bachelors' dining club, the Onze-sans-femme (Eleven Bachelors).[44]\\r\\nFor some time, Verne's father pressed him to abandon his writing and begin a business as a lawyer. However, Verne argued in his letters that he could only find success in literature.[45] The pressure to plan for a secure future in law reached its climax in January 1852, when his father offered Verne his own Nantes law practice.[46] Faced with this ultimatum, Verne decided conclusively to continue his literary life and refuse the job, writing: \\"Am I not right to follow my own instincts? It's because I know who I am that I realize what I can be one day.\\"[47]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Verne was spending much time at the Bibliothque nationale de France, conducting research for his stories and feeding his passion for science and recent discoveries, especially in geography. It was in this period that Verne met the illustrious geographer and explorer Jacques Arago, who continued to travel extensively despite his blindness (he had lost his sight completely in 1837). The two men became good friends, and Arago's innovative and witty accounts of his travels led Verne toward a newly developing genre of literature: that of travel writing.[48][49]\\r\\nIn 1852, two new pieces from Verne appeared in the Muse des familles: \\"Martin Paz\\", a novella set in Lima, which Verne wrote in 1851 and published 10 July through 11 August 1852, and Les Chateaux en Californie, ou, Pierre qui roule namasse pas mousse (The Castles in California, or, A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss), a one-act comedy full of racy double entendres.[50] In April and May 1854, the magazine published Verne's short story \\"Master Zacharius\\", an E. T. A. Hoffmann-like fantasy featuring a sharp condemnation of scientific hubris and ambition,[51] followed soon afterward by \\"A Winter Amid the Ice\\", a polar adventure story whose themes closely anticipated many of Verne's novels.[52] The Muse also published some nonfiction popular science articles which, though unsigned, are generally attributed to Verne.[42] Verne's work for the magazine was cut short in 1856, when he had a serious quarrel with Pitre-Chevalier and refused to continue contributing (a refusal he would maintain until 1863, when Pitre-Chevalier died, and the magazine went to new editorship).[53]\\r\\nWhile writing stories and articles for Pitre-Chevalier, Verne began to form the idea of inventing a new kind of novel, a Roman de la Science (novel of science), which would allow him to incorporate large amounts of the factual information he so enjoyed researching in the Bibliothque. He is said to have discussed the project with the elder Alexandre Dumas, who had tried something similar with an unfinished novel, Isaac Laquedem, and who enthusiastically encouraged Verne's project.[54]\\r\\nAt the end of 1854, another outbreak of cholera led to the death of Jules Seveste, Verne's employer at the Thatre Lyrique and by then a good friend.[52] Though his contract only held him to a further year of service, Verne remained connected to the theatre for several years after Seveste's death, seeing additional productions to fruition.[55] He also continued to write plays and musical comedies, most of which were not performed.[53]\\r\\nIn May 1856, Verne traveled to Amiens to be the best man at the wedding of a Nantes friend, Auguste Lelarge, to an Amiens woman named Aime du Fraysse de Viane. Verne, invited to stay with the bride's family, took to them warmly, befriending the entire household and finding himself increasingly attracted to the bride's sister, Honorine de Viane Morel, a widow aged 26 with two young children.[56][57] Hoping to find a secure source of income, as well as a chance to court Morel in earnest, he jumped at her brother's offer to go into business with a brokerage.[58] Verne's father was initially dubious but gave in to his son's requests for approval in November 1856. With his financial situation finally looking promising, Verne won the favor of Morel and her family, and the couple were married on 10 January 1857.[59]\\r\\nVerne plunged into his new business obligations, leaving his work at the Thatre Lyrique and taking up a full-time job as an agent de change[53] on the Paris Bourse, where he became the associate of the broker Fernand Eggly.[60] Verne woke up early each morning so that he would have time to write, before going to the Bourse for the day's work; in the rest of his spare time, he continued to consort with the Onze-Sans-Femme club (all eleven of its \\"bachelors\\" had by this time gotten married). He also continued to frequent the Bibliothque to do scientific and historical research, much of which he copied onto notecards for future usea system he would continue for the rest of his life.[53] According to the recollections of a colleague, Verne \\"did better in repartee than in business\\".[60]\\r\\nIn July 1858, Verne and Aristide Hignard seized an opportunity offered by Hignard's brother: a sea voyage, at no charge, from Bordeaux to Liverpool and Scotland. The journey, Verne's first trip outside France, deeply impressed him, and upon his return to Paris he fictionalized his recollections to form the backbone of a semi-autobiographical novel, Backwards to Britain (written in the autumn and winter of 1859ÿ1860 and not published until 1989).[61] A second complementary voyage in 1861 took Hignard and Verne to Stockholm, from where they traveled to Christiania and through Telemark.[62] Verne left Hignard in Denmark to return in haste to Paris, but missed the birth on 3 August 1861 of his only biological son, Michel.[63]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Verne continued work on the idea of a Roman de la Science, which he developed in a rough draft inspired, according to his recollections, by his \\"love for maps and the great explorers of the world\\". It took shape as a story of travel across Africa and would eventually become his first published novel, Five Weeks in a Balloon.[53]\\r\\nIn 1862, through their mutual acquaintance Alfred de Brhat, Verne came into contact with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, and submitted to him the manuscript of his developing novel, then called Voyage en Ballon.[64] Hetzel, already the publisher of Balzac, George Sand, Victor Hugo, and other well-known authors, had long been planning to launch a high-quality family magazine in which entertaining fiction would combine with scientific education.[65] He saw Verne, with his demonstrated inclination toward scrupulously researched adventure stories, as an ideal contributor for such a magazine, and accepted the novel, giving Verne suggestions for improvement. Verne made the proposed revisions within two weeks and returned to Hetzel with the final draft, now titled Five Weeks in a Balloon.[66] It was published by Hetzel on 31 January 1863.[67]\\r\\nTo secure his services for the planned magazine, to be called the Magasin d'ducation et de Rcration (Magazine of Education and Recreation), Hetzel also drew up a long-term contract in which Verne would give him three volumes of text per year, each of which Hetzel would buy outright for a flat fee. Verne, finding both a steady salary and a sure outlet for writing at last, accepted immediately.[68] For the rest of his lifetime, most of his novels would be serialized in Hetzel's Magasin before their appearance in book form, beginning with his second novel for Hetzel, The Adventures of Captain Hatteras (1864ÿ65).[67]\\r\\nWhen The Adventures of Captain Hatteras was published in book form in 1866, Hetzel publicly announced his literary and educational ambitions for Verne's novels by saying in a preface that Verne's works would form a novel sequence called the Voyages extraordinaires (Extraordinary Voyages or Extraordinary Journeys), and that Verne's aim was \\"to outline all the geographical, geological, physical, and astronomical knowledge amassed by modern science and to recount, in an entertaining and picturesque format that is his own, the history of the universe.\\"[69] Late in life, Verne confirmed that this commission had become the running theme of his novels: \\"My object has been to depict the earth, and not the earth alone, but the universe And I have tried at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style. It is said that there can't be any style in a novel of adventure, but it isn't true.\\"[70] However, he also noted that the project was extremely ambitious: \\"Yes! But the Earth is very large, and life is very short! In order to leave a completed work behind, one would need to live to be at least 100 years old!\\"[71]\\r\\nHetzel influenced many of Verne's novels directly, especially in the first few years of their collaboration, for Verne was initially so happy to find a publisher that he agreed to almost all of the changes Hetzel suggested. For example, when Hetzel disapproved of the original climax of Captain Hatteras, including the death of the title character, Verne wrote an entirely new conclusion in which Hatteras survived.[72] Hetzel also rejected Verne's next submission, Paris in the Twentieth Century, believing its pessimistic view of the future and its condemnation of technological progress were too subversive for a family magazine.[73] (The manuscript, believed lost for some time after Verne's death, was finally published in 1994.)[74]\\r\\nThe relationship between publisher and writer changed significantly around 1869, when Verne and Hetzel were brought into conflict over the manuscript for Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Verne had initially conceived of the submariner Captain Nemo as a Polish scientist whose acts of vengeance were directed against the Russians who had killed his family during the January Uprising. Hetzel, not wanting to alienate the lucrative Russian market for Verne's books, demanded that Nemo be made an enemy of the slave trade, a situation that would make him an unambiguous hero. Verne, after fighting vehemently against the change, finally invented a compromise in which Nemo's past is left mysterious. After this disagreement, Verne became notably cooler in his dealings with Hetzel, taking suggestions into consideration but often rejecting them outright.[75]\\r\\nFrom that point, Verne published two or more volumes a year. The most successful of these are: Voyage au centre de la Terre (Journey to the Center of the Earth, 1864); De la Terre  la Lune (From the Earth to the Moon, 1865); Vingt mille lieues sous les mers (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, 1869); and Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours (Around the World in Eighty Days), which first appeared in Le Temps in 1872. Verne could now live on his writings. But most of his wealth came from the stage adaptations of Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours (1874) and Michel Strogoff (1876), which he wrote with Adolphe d'Ennery.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1867, Verne bought a small ship, the Saint-Michel, which he successively replaced with the Saint-Michel II and the Saint-Michel III as his financial situation improved. On board the Saint-Michel III, he sailed around Europe. After his first novel, most of his stories were first serialised in the Magazine d'ducation et de Rcration, a Hetzel biweekly publication, before being published in book form. His brother Paul contributed to 40th French climbing of the Mont-Blanc and a collection of short stories ÿ Doctor Ox ÿ in 1874. Verne became wealthy and famous.[citation needed]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Michel Verne married an actress against his father's wishes, had two children by an underage mistress, and buried himself in debts.[citation needed] The relationship between father and son improved as Michel grew older.[citation needed]\\r\\nThough he was raised Catholic, Verne became a deist in his later years, from about 1870 onward.[76][77] Some scholars believe his deist philosophy is reflected in his novels, as they often involve the notion of God or divine providence but rarely mention the concept of Christ.[78][79]\\r\\nOn 9 March 1886, as Verne was coming home, his twenty-six-year-old nephew, Gaston, shot at him twice with a pistol. The first bullet missed, but the second one entered Verne's left leg, giving him a permanent limp that could not be overcome. This incident was hushed up in the media, but Gaston spent the rest of his life in a mental asylum.[80]\\r\\nAfter the death of both his mother and Hetzel, Jules Verne began publishing darker works. In 1888, Verne entered politics and was elected town councilor of Amiens, where he championed several improvements and served for fifteen years.[81]\\r\\nVerne was made a Chevalier de la Legion d'honneur in 1870. He was promoted to an Officier de la Legion d'honneur in 1892.\\r\\nOn 24 March 1905, while ill with diabetes, Verne died at his home in Amiens, 44 Boulevard Longueville (now Boulevard Jules-Verne). His son, Michel Verne, oversaw publication of the novels Invasion of the Sea and The Lighthouse at the End of the World after Jules's death. The Voyages extraordinaires series continued for several years afterwards at the same rate of two volumes a year. It was later discovered that Michel Verne had made extensive changes in these stories, and the original versions were eventually published at the end of the 20th century by the Jules Verne Society (Socit Jules Verne).[citation needed]\\r\\nVerne's largest body of work is the Voyages extraordinaires series, which includes all of his novels except for the two rejected manuscripts Paris in the Twentieth Century and Backwards to Britain (published posthumously in 1994 and 1989, respectively) and for projects left unfinished at his death (many of which would be posthumously adapted or rewritten for publication by his son Michel).[82] Verne also wrote many plays, poems, song texts, operetta libretti, and short stories, as well as a variety of essays and miscellaneous non-fiction.\\r\\nAfter his debut under Hetzel, Verne was enthusiastically received in France by writers and scientists alike, with George Sand and Thophile Gautier among his earliest admirers.[83] Several notable contemporary figures, from the geographer Vivien de Saint-Martin to the critic Jules Claretie, spoke highly of Verne and his works in critical and biographical notes.[84]\\r\\nHowever, Verne's growing popularity among readers and playgoers (due especially to the highly successful stage version of Around the World in Eighty Days) led to a gradual change in his literary reputation. As the novels and stage productions continued to sell, many contemporary critics felt that Verne's status as a commercially popular author meant he could only be seen as a mere genre-based storyteller, rather than a serious author worthy of academic study.[85]\\r\\nThis denial of formal literary status took various forms, including dismissive criticism by such writers as mile Zola and the lack of nomination to Verne for membership in the Acadmie Fran?aise,[85] and was far from unrecognized by Verne himself, who said in a late interview: \\"The great regret of my life is that I have never taken any place in French literature.\\"[86] To Verne, who considered himself \\"a man of letters and an artist, living in the pursuit of the ideal\\",[87] this critical dismissal on the basis of literary ideology could only be seen as the ultimate snub.[88]\\r\\nThis bifurcation of Verne as a popular genre writer but a critical persona non grata continued after his death, with early biographies (including one by Verne's own niece, Marguerite Allotte de la Fu?e) focusing on error-filled and embroidered hagiography of Verne as a popular figure rather than on Verne's actual working methods or his output.[89] Meanwhile, sales of Verne's novels in their original unabridged versions dropped markedly even in Verne's home country, with abridged versions aimed directly at children taking their place.[90]\\r\\nHowever, the decades after Verne's death also saw the rise in France of the \\"Jules Verne cult\\", a steadily growing group of scholars and young writers who took Verne's works seriously as literature and willingly noted his influence on their own pioneering works. Some of the cult founded the Socit Jules Verne, the first academic society for Verne scholars; many others became highly respected avant garde and surrealist literary figures in their own right. Their praise and analyses, emphasizing Verne's stylistic innovations and enduring literary themes, proved highly influential for literary studies to come.[91]\\r\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, thanks in large part to a sustained wave of serious literary study from well-known French scholars and writers, Verne's reputation skyrocketed in France.[92][93] Roland Barthes' seminal essay \\"Nautilus et Bateau Ivre\\" (\\"The Nautilus and the Drunken Boat\\") was influential in its exegesis of the Voyages extraordinares as a purely literary text, while book-length studies by such figures as Marcel Mor and Jean Chesneaux considered Verne from a multitude of thematic vantage points.[94]\\r\\nFrench literary journals devoted entire issues to Verne and his work, with essays by such imposing literary figures as Michel Butor, Georges Borgeaud, Marcel Brion, Pierre Versins, Michel Foucault, Ren Barjavel, Marcel Lecomte, Francis Lacassin, and Michel Serres; meanwhile, Verne's entire published opus returned to print, with unabridged and illustrated editions of his works printed by Livre de Poche and ditions Rencontre.[95] The wave reached its climax in Verne's sesquicentennial year 1978, when he was made the subject of an academic colloquium at the Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle, and Journey to the Center of the Earth was accepted for the French university system's Agrgation reading list. Since these events, Verne has been consistently recognized in Europe as a legitimate member of the French literary canon, with academic studies and new publications steadily continuing.[96]\\r\\nVerne's reputation in English-speaking countries has been considerably slower in changing. Throughout the 20th century, most Anglophone scholars dismissed Verne as a genre writer for children and a na?ve proponent of science and technology (despite strong evidence to the contrary on both counts), thus finding him more interesting as a technological \\"prophet\\" or as a subject of comparison to English-language writers such as Edgar Allan Poe and H. G. Wells than as a topic of literary study in his own right. This narrow view of Verne has undoubtedly been influenced by the poor-quality English translations and very loosely adapted Hollywood film versions through which most American and British readers have discovered Verne.[4][97] However, since the mid-1980s a considerable number of serious English-language studies and translations have appeared, suggesting that a rehabilitation of Verne's Anglophone reputation may currently be underway.[98][99]\\r\\nTranslation of Verne into English began in 1852, when Verne's short story \\"A Voyage in a Balloon\\" (1851) was published in the American journal Sartain's Union Magazine of Literature and Art in a translation by Anne T. Wilbur.[100] Translation of his novels began in 1869 with William Lackland's translation of Five Weeks in a Balloon (originally published in 1863),[101] and continued steadily throughout Verne's lifetime, with publishers and hired translators often working in great haste to rush his most lucrative titles into English-language print.[102] Unlike Hetzel, who targeted all ages with his publishing strategies for the Voyages extraordinaires, the British and American publishers of Verne chose to market his books almost exclusively to young audiences; this business move, with its implication that Verne could be treated purely as a children's author, had a long-lasting effect on Verne's reputation in English-speaking countries.[98][103]\\r\\nThese contemporaneous English-language translations have been widely criticized for their extensive textual omissions, errors, and alterations, and are not considered adequate representations of Verne's actual novels.[102][104][105] The British writer Adam Roberts, in an essay for The Guardian titled \\"Jules Verne deserves a better translation service\\", commented: \\"I'd always liked reading Jules Verne and I've read most of his novels; but it wasn't until recently that I really understood I hadn't been reading Jules Verne at all.... It's a bizarre situation for a world-famous writer to be in. Indeed, I can't think of a major writer who has been so poorly served by translation.\\"[104]\\r\\nSimilarly, the American novelist Michael Crichton observed:\\r\\nVerne's prose is lean and fast-moving in a peculiarly modern way  [but] Verne has been particularly ill-served by his English translators. At best they have provided us with clunky, choppy, tone-deaf prose. At worstas in the notorious 1872 \\"translation\\" [of Journey to the Center of the Earth] published by Griffith & Farranthey have blithely altered the text, giving Verne's characters new names, and adding whole pages of their own invention, thus effectively obliterating the meaning and tone of Verne's original.[105]\\r\\nSince 1965, a considerable number of more accurate English translations of Verne have appeared. However, the highly criticized older translations continue to be republished, due to their public domain status and in many cases their easy availability in online sources.[98]\\r\\nThe relationship between Verne's Voyages extraordinaires and the literary genre science fiction is a complex one. Verne, like H. G. Wells, is frequently cited as one of the founders of the genre, and his profound influence on its development is indisputable; however, many earlier writers, such as Lucian of Samosata and Mary Shelley, have also been cited as creators of science fiction, an unavoidable ambiguity arising from the vague definition and history of the genre.[6]\\r\\nA primary issue at the heart of the dispute is the question of whether Verne's works count as science fiction to begin with. Maurice Renard claimed that Verne \\"never wrote a single sentence of scientific-marvelous\\".[106] Verne himself argued repeatedly in interviews that his novels were not meant to be read as scientific, saying \\"I have invented nothing.\\"[107] His own goal was rather to \\"depict the earth [and] at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style\\",[70] as he pointed out in an example:\\r\\nI wrote Five Weeks in a Balloon, not as a story about ballooning, but as a story about Africa. I always was greatly interested in geography and travel, and I wanted to give a romantic description of Africa. Now, there was no means of taking my travellers through Africa otherwise than in a balloon, and that is why a balloon is introduced. I may say that at the time I wrote the novel, as now, I had no faith in the possibility of ever steering balloons[70]\\r\\nClosely related to Verne's science-fiction reputation is the often-repeated claim that he is a \\"prophet\\" of scientific progress, and that many of his novels involve elements of technology that were fantastic for his day but later became commonplace.[108] These claims have a long history, especially in America, but the modern scholarly consensus is that such claims of prophecy are heavily exaggerated.[109] As with science fiction, Verne himself flatly denied that he was a futuristic prophet, saying that any connection between scientific developments and his work was \\"mere coincidence\\" and attributing his indisputable scientific accuracy to his extensive research: \\"even before I began writing stories, I always took numerous notes out of every book, newspaper, magazine, or scientific report that I came across.\\"[110] Because Verne only focused on technology and principles that were scientifically possible, or assumed to be possible, novels like From the Earth to the Moon and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea belongs in the subgenre known as mundane science fiction.[citation needed]\\r\\nVerne's novels have had a wide influence on both literary and scientific works; writers known to have been influenced by Verne include Marcel Aym, Roland Barthes, Ren Barjavel, Michel Butor, Blaise Cendrars, Paul Claudel, Jean Cocteau, Fran?ois Mauriac, Raymond Roussel, Claude Roy, Antoine Saint-Exupry, and Jean-Paul Sartre,[111] while scientists and explorers who acknowledged Verne's inspiration have included Richard E. Byrd, Yuri Gagarin, Simon Lake, Hubert Lyautey, Guglielmo Marconi, Fridtjof Nansen, Wernher von Braun,[97] and Jack Parsons.[112] He is credited with helping inspire the steampunk genre, a literary and social movement that glamorizes science fiction based on 19th-century technology.[113][114]\\r\\nRay Bradbury summed up Verne's influence on literature and science the world over by saying: \\"We are all, in one way or another, the children of Jules Verne.\\"[115]","field3":"When did jules verne wrote his first book?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Carlin Isles","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Carlin Isles (born November 21, 1989) is an American rugby union and rugby sevens player.

Isles had been touted as the fastest rugby player in the world.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIsles and his twin sister, Tambra, grew up Massillion, Ohio in foster homes, rarely seeing their mother. Often hungry, he ate what he could as a child, including dog food. At the age of seven the siblings were adopted by Starlett and Charles Isles; Isles credits his adoptive parents with providing the stability and love he needed to excel in sports.[2]\\r\\nCarlin Isles was a gifted American football and Track and Field athlete while attending Jackson High School (Massillon, Ohio). Isles holds the school records in the long jump, 100 meter, 200 meter, and 400 meter events at Jackson. He was also a part of the record holding 4 G 200?m relay team at Jackson High School. His 2007 100m school record breaking time was 10.58 seconds which was also a county record at that time. Carlin was a two-time, back-to-back OATCCC Indoor State Champion in high school in the 60m dash running 6.83 seconds which was a Division I meet record up until March 2012. He was a state runner-up in the 200m dash his junior year and runner-up in the long jump and 100m dash his senior year in addition to being third in the state in the 100m dash his junior year. In his senior year at Jackson High School, Isles ran a 4.28 second, electronically timed 40 yard dash.[3] Carlin was an all-conference, all-county football player as well.\\r\\nIsles continued running track and playing American football while enrolled at Ashland University where he was an All-American in the 60m dash and ran a personal best of 6.68 seconds which is a school record. He holds freshman class records in the 100m dash and 200m dash (indoor and outdoor). On the football field, Carlin was an All-GLIAC selection and holds school records for most kickoff return yardage in a game (174 yards) and longest kickoff return for TD (100 yards)\\r\\nBefore taking up rugby in 2012, Isles ranked as the 36th fastest sprinter in the United States with a 100 metres outdoor personal best of 10.24 seconds.[4]\\r\\nIsles took up the sport of rugby in 2012.[5] He was encouraged to begin playing rugby by Miles Craigwell, another crossover athlete from American football who ended up playing rugby for the United States national team.[5] Isles played his club rugby with the Gentlemen of Aspen RFC, based in Aspen, Colorado.\\r\\nIsles first caught the attention of the rugby media in summer of 2012 when Rugby Mag dubbed him \\"The Fastest Man in American Rugby.\\"[5] Isles played for the US national developmental team Atlantis in July 2012 at the Victoria 7s tournament.[5]\\r\\nIsles debuted for the US national sevens team in October 2012 at the Gold Coast Sevens as a second-half substitute against New Zealand, and scored a try in his first minute on the pitch.[1] Overall at that tournament he scored three tries and was one of the leading scorers for the U.S team. Isles continued to be a regular scorer for the United States during the 2012ÿ13 IRB Sevens World Series. Isles was quickly noticed for his incredible speed. A YouTube video posted on December 9, 2012 titled \\"Carlin Isles: Olympic Dream\\" further boosted his profile, as the video went viral and by December 23, 2012 and now has over 6?million views.[1] The video closes with the words of long-time IRB commentator Nigel Starmer-Smith:\\r\\nIsles is playing for the US national team at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where rugby sevens will be reintroduced as an Olympic sport.[5]\\r\\nIsles was under contract with Glasgow Warriors of the Pro12.[6] In February 2014, he signed to play with Glasgow Warriors. He was a part of the Warriors 7's side that won the Melrose Sevens in April 2014.[7] Isles did not make an appearance for Glasgow Warriors first XV that season but gained experience playing 15's with the BT Scottish Premiership side Ayr RFC, an amateur club in the Warriors district. At the end of the season Isles decided to leave the club and concentrate on playing rugby sevens in the 2016 Olympics.[8]\\r\\nHe was signed by the Detroit Lions on December 26, 2013[9] to the team's practice squad.[10] During a workout with the Detroit Lions Isles ran a time of 4.22 seconds in the 40-yard dash, the fastest time recorded that year.[11]\\r\\nIn February 2014, Isles left the Lions to take up a contract with the Glasgow Warriors.[12]","field3":"Who is the fastest player in rugby union?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"a Philippine banking company based in Makati","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Banco de Oro (BDO), legally known as BDO Unibank, Inc., is a Philippine banking company based in Makati.

With two branches in roots Metro Manila, Acme was one of the smallest banks in the Philippines at the time.\\r\\nIn November 1976, Acme was acquired by the Sy Group, the group of companies currently owned by retail magnate Henry Sy, and renamed Banco de Oro Savings and Mortgage Bank.\\r\\nIn December 1994, BDO became a commercial bank. To reflect the bank's new status, BDO was renamed Banco de Oro Commercial Bank, and in September 1996, BDO became a universal bank, which led to the bank's name being changed to the current Banco de Oro Universal Bank (BDO Unibank). It is one of the many banks owned by a Chinese-Filipino in the Philippines (others include Metrobank and Chinabank).\\r\\nBDO Unibank eventually became involved in insurance services in 1997 (it is a bancassurance firm) by establishing a subsidiary called BDO Insurance Brokers. In 1999, BDO Unibank expanded its insurance services through partnerships with Zamora Assurance and Assicurazoni Generali s.p.a., one of the world's largest insurance firms, and Jerneh Asia Berhad, a member of Malaysia's Kuok Group.

Under the proposal, BDO Unibank. will swap 1.6 of its shares for every 1 Equitable PCI share. As a second option, BDO Unibank. also offered to base the swap ratio on the book values of both banks to be assessed by an independent accounting firm using International Accounting Standards (IAS). To effect the merger, BDO Unibank. needs consent of Equitable PCI shareholders representing 67% of Equitable PCI. These include the Social Security System (SSS) with 29%, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) with 14%, and the family of Equitable PCI chairman Ferdinand Martin Romualdez with eight percent. BDO Unibank. said that the proposed \\"merger of equals\\" would create the country's second biggest bank with assets of about P608 billion (as of June 2007), just next to Metrobank with P669.1 billion (as of June 2007), the current banking industry leader in the Philippines.

In fact, UBS studied the deal and claims that the merger through the stock swap option is a \\"win-win\\" situation. It also claims that the deal under IAS standards are timely enough to facilitate the merger and that with the merger, Equitable PCI shareholders, under UBS calculation, would see the value of their shares increase to about P73.60 per share, more than the fair value target price of 67 pesos.\\r\\nWith Equitable PCI and BDO Unibank merging fully realized.

Around A.D. 600, the Arawaks no longer lived on the island, perhaps because they had integrated with another culture or perhaps because they had been killed by illness.[4] By A.D. 1000, the indigenous Tano inhabited the island. They called the island Borikn (alternatively, Borinqun), which means \\"land of the valiant one\\" [5][4] and later Puerto Ricans called themselves boricua, borincano and borinque?o to embrace their indigenous identity.[6] In the 15th century, the Carib lived on nearby islands and periodically invaded Tano villages.[4]\\r\\nThe Spanish conquered the island, assuming government in 1508, colonized it, and assumed hegemony over the natives. The Tano population dwindled due to disease, tribal warfare, and forced labor, so the Spanish began importing large numbers of slaves from Africa. Spanish men arrived on the island disproportionately to Spanish women; African and Tano women would sometimes marry them, resulting in a mulatto or mixed tri-racial ethnicity.\\r\\nIn the late 18th century, the number of African slaves began to dwindle on the island. The British ban on slavery resulted in slave raids on Puerto Rico. Many slaves also escaped to neighboring islands.\\r\\nDuring the 19th century large numbers of immigrants from Spain, as well as numerous Spaniards living in former Spanish colonies in South America, also arrived in Puerto Rico (See Spanish immigration to Puerto Rico). Although the vast majority of settlers came from Spain, Catholics from France, Ireland, Italy and other European countries were also granted land by Spain as one of the provisions of the Real Cdula de Gracias de 1815 (Royal Decree of Graces of 1815). These immigrants were allowed to settle on the island, with a certain amount of free land and enslaved persons granted to them. In return, they had to profess fealty to the Spanish Crown. During the early 20th century Jews began to settle in Puerto Rico. The first large group of Jews to settle in Puerto Rico were European refugees fleeing Germanÿoccupied Europe in the 1930s. Puerto Rico's economic boom of the 1950s attracted a considerable number of Jewish families from the U.S. mainland, who were joined after 1959 by an influx of Jewish emigres from Castro's Cuba.[7]\\r\\nThe mass immigration that occurred during the 19th century helped the population grow from 155,000 in 1800 to almost 1,000,000 at the close of the century.\\r\\nEmigration has been a major part of Puerto Rico's recent history as well. Starting in the post-World War II period waves of Puerto Ricans moved to the continental United States, particularly to New York City; Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Camden, New Jersey; Providence, Rhode Island; Springfield; Hartford and New Haven, Connecticut; Boston, Massachusetts; Orlando, Miami and Tampa, Florida; Philadelphia and Reading, Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C., Chicago and Los Angeles, California. This continued even as Puerto Rico's economy improved and its birth rate declined.\\r\\n[13] Structure of the population (01.07.2012) (Estimates) (Data refer to projections based on the 2010 Population Census)?:\\r\\nThe first census by the United States in 1899 reported a population of 953,243 inhabitants, 61.8% of them classified as white, 31.9% as mixed, and 6.3% as black.\\r\\nA strong European immigration wave and large importation of slaves from Africa helped increase the population of Puerto Rico sixfold during the 19th century. No major immigration wave occurred during the 20th century.[19]\\r\\nThe federal Naturalization Act, signed into law on March 26, 1790, by President Washington stated that immigrants to the United States had to be White according to the definition under the British Common Law, which the United States inherited. The legal definition of Whiteness differed greatly from White Society's informal definition, thus Jews, Gypsies, Middle Eastern Peoples and those of the Indian Subcontinent were before 1917 classified as White for Immigration purposes but not considered White by the society at large. The Naturalization Act of 1870, passed during Reconstruction, allowed for peoples of African descent to become U.S. Citizens but it excluded other nonwhites. The U.S. Supreme Court in the case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898) declared that all nonwhites who were born in the United States were eligible for citizenship via the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. U.S. Immigration Policy was first restricted toward Chinese with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Gentleman's Agreement of 1907 in which Japan voluntarily barred emigration to the United States and the Immigration Act of 1917 or the Asiatic Barred Zone which barred immigrants from all of the Middle East, the Steppes and the Orient, excluding the Philippines which was then a US Colony. European Jews and Gypsies, although of Asiatic Ancestry, were not affected by the Asiatic Barred Zone, as they held European Citizenship. The Johnson-Reed act of 1924 applied only to the Eastern Hemisphere. The Act imposed immigration quotas on Europe, which allowed for easy immigration from Northern and Western Europe, but almost excluded the Mediterranean and Slavic Nations. Africa and Asia were excluded altogether. The Western Hemisphere remained unrestricted to immigrate to the United States. Thus under the Immigration Act of 1924 all Hispanics and Caribbeans could immigrate to the United States, but a White family from Poland or Russia could not immigrate. Puerto Rican Citizenship was created under the Foraker Act, Pub.L. 56ÿ191, 31 Stat. 77 but it wasn't until 1917 that Puerto Ricans were granted full American Citizenship under the JonesÿShafroth Act (Pub.L. 64ÿ368, 39 Stat. 951. Puerto Ricans, excluding those of obvious African ancestry, were like most Hispanics formally classified as White under U.S. Law, but this classification did not prevent informal discrimination against them by Anglo-Americans.\\r\\nUntil 1950 the U.S. Bureau of the Census attempted to quantify the racial composition of the island's population, while experimenting with various racial taxonomies. In 1960 the census dropped the racial identification question for Puerto Rico but included it again in the year 2000. The only category that remained constant over time was white, even as other racial labels shifted greatlyfrom \\"colored\\" to \\"Black\\", \\"mulatto\\" and \\"other\\". Regardless of the precise terminology, the census reported that the bulk of the Puerto Rican population was white from 1899 to 2000.[15]\\r\\nIn the late 1700s, Puerto Rico had laws like the Regla del Sacar or Gracias al Sacar where a person of mixed ancestry could be considered legally white so long as they could prove that at least one person per generation in the last four generations had also been legally white. Therefore, people of mixed ancestry with known white lineage were classified as white, the opposite of the \\"one-drop rule\\" in the United States.[20]\\r\\nAccording to the 1920 Puerto Rico census, 2,505 individuals immigrated to Puerto Rico between 1910 and 1920. Of these, 2,270 were classified as \\"white\\" in the 1920 census (1,205 from Spain, 280 from Venezuela, 180 from Cuba, and 135 from the Dominican Republic). During the same 10-year period, 7,873 Puerto Ricans emigrated to the U.S. Of these, 6,561 were listed as \\"white\\" on the U.S mainland census, 909 as \\"Spanish white\\" and 403 as \\"black\\".[21]\\r\\nAccording to the 2015 Race and Hispanic Origin estimate (2011ÿ2015 American Community Survey) published by the US Census Bureau, the data for Puerto Rico was as follows:[22]\\r\\nPuerto Ricans, on average, have genetic contributions from Europeans, West Africans, and Native Americans of approximately 66%, 18%, and 16%, respectively.[26] A recent study of Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 800 individuals found that patrilineal input, as indicated by the Y-chromosome, showed 66% of Puerto Ricans could trace their ancestry to male European ancestors, 18% could trace it to male African ancestors, and 16% could trace it to male Native American ancestors.[27]\\r\\nIn a study done on Puerto Rican women (of all races) born on the island but living in New York by Carolina Bonilla, Mark D. Shriver and Esteban Parra in 2004, the ancestry proportions corresponding to the three parental populations were found to be 53.3I2.8% European, 29.1I2.3% West African, and 17.6I2.4% Native American based on autosomal ancestry informative markers. Although autosomal markers tests seem to draw a more broad picture than that of single, gender-based mtDNA and Y-Chromosome tests, the problem with autosomnal DNA is in the archaic categories used: \\"European\\", \\"Sub-Saharan African\\", \\"East Asian\\" & \\"Native American\\". \\"Asian\\" (South, North or East) & \\"North African\\" are not included. These generalised categories may not take into account the complexity of migratory patterns across the Old World. The study also found that, from the women sampled, 98% had European ancestry markers, 87% had African ancestry markers, 84% had Native American ancestry markers, 5% showed only African and European markers, 4% showed mostly Native American and European markers, 2% showed only African markers, and 2% showed mostly European markers.[28]\\r\\nExtensive research proves that childbirth causes a multitude of physical and psychological impacts on women. Women who become pregnant can experience symptoms such as anxiety, paranoia, depression, anxiousness and moodiness. Extensive epidemiological research on the mental health of Puerto Rican women has proven that the majority of women experiences illnesses that they refer to as nervios and ataques de nervios or Nerves and attack of nerves. Due to impoverished communities in Puerto Rico, poor healthcare access and reliance; women have shown to display more pronounced mental illnesses, with little to no outlet. As a result of the debt crisis in Puerto Rico, insurance companies purposely delayed the issuing of paychecks to doctors. Additionally, insurance companies also overruled the doctors medical decisions and replaced it for a less costly alternative. In 2016, physicians in Puerto Rico earned a median of $41.45 per hour which is less than half of the median that was earned by physicians in the United States which was $99.48 per hour. Due to better opportunities within the United States, many healthcare professionals have fled the island. Between 2005 and 2013, 1,200 physicians and surgeons left to the United States which equated 12% of the total medics who worked in the island at that time. Mental illness amongst childbearing women also became more pronounced after Hurricane Maria. Hurricane Maria impacted resource and health care availability; Moreover, after the migration of Puerto Rican professionals as a result of the extensive damage left by Hurricane Maria; women were left with limited medical resources. [29] [30] [31] These findings are consistent with the historical record that the native male Taino population was virtually wiped out shortly after the arrival of the Spanish colonists to the Island.[32]\\r\\nWomen who intend to become pregnant in Puerto Rico report fearing that having children will be a mistake since they feel they will not be able to properly financially support their children. In April of 2016, the CDC reported that 65% of pregnancies in Puerto Rico were unintended. Accessibility to all forms of contraceptives are limited by high out of pocket costs, inadequate reimbursements made by insurance companies, lack of effective resource distribution, limited number of family planning and delivery sites, as well as a lack of education on various contraception options. The island also has a shortage of properly trained medical personnel with the ability to insert, remove, and manage long-term reversible contraceptives (such as nexplanon, implanon, iud, copper iud, and depo vera shots). All of these hindrances that inhibit women to have access to contraception relate back to the poverty faced by many in Puerto Rico.\\r\\n[33]\\r\\nComplications of pregnancy are health issues that arise during pregnancies which can involve the health of the mother, the fetus, and/or both. Amongst these complications are, anemia (which can occur due to malnutrition), ectopic pregnancy (a condition when a fertilized egg develops outside of the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube), fetal problems (which can include poor growth or heart problems), and gestational diabetes (too high blood sugar levels during pregnancy). Other issues that can occur are infections such as toxoplasmosis (an infection caused by a parasite found in cat feces, soil, and raw/undercooked meat). Preventive measures for this infection include washing hands with soap and water, and washing produce before eating. After hurricane Maria, about 1 million of Puerto Ricans residents were left without reliable drinking water and thus dont have the basic resources needed in order to prevent such infections. Most of the other pregnancy complications mentioned can be treated and/or prevented with access to proper medical attention, and medicine but for this to be possible, access to medical sites and healthcare coverage is essential. The inability to acquire such necessities are directly attributed to poverty levels and lack of funding in the island and they attribute to mental illnesses such as depression. Within the general population in Puerto Rico 7.3% of Puerto Rican adults ages 18-64 have reported suffering from mental illness. Additionally, 2 out of 10 report suffering from some kind of psychiatric ailment and 1 out of 10 suffers from depression. 23.7% of individuals abuse a combination of drugs and alcohol. Unfortunately, 4 out of every 10 Puerto Ricans who suffer from mental illness do not receive any treatment. Amongst this population are pregnant women; pregnant women who experience mental illness do not receive proper medical attention. Within these women, those who are experiencing mental illnesses might not know it due to poor education and not receive appropriate care. 7.4% of Puerto Ricans reported not having access to healthcare in the 2016 census.[34][35]\\r\\nPostpartum depression and Postpartum psychosis are common amongst new mothers. Postpartum depression, a depressive state that involves feelings of sadness, lack of interest, feeling like a bad mother and fear of harming the baby, is a condition that must be treated promptly. Postpartum psychosis is a more severe condition where new mothers will experience delusions and hallucinations; this condition must be treated immediately as it can be harmful for both the mother and the baby. Postpartum depression has a prevalence rate of 6%-13% and postpartum physcosis a rate of 1-2%. However, women in Puerto Rico report having symptoms of postpartum psychosis and never have knowing that they were depressed. Moreover, many Puerto Rican women have reported not having the knowledge and or accessibility to receive care.[34][36]\\r\\nThere are many religious beliefs represented in the island with Christianity as the religion indicated by the majority in 2010.\\r\\nReligious breakdown in Puerto Rico (2010):[37]\\r\\nPew Research Center (2010)[37]\\r\\nA recent report providing a full breakdown as to specific religions is not available; the most recent was for 2006.\\r\\nThe Christian Denominational Breakdown was as follows in 2006:[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Roman Catholic Church has been historically the most dominant religion of the majority of Puerto Ricans, with Puerto Rico having the first dioceses in the Americas.[39] This religion was brought by Spanish colonists. The first dioceses in the Americas, including that of Puerto Rico, were authorized by Pope Julius?II in 1511.[40] One Pope, John Paul?II, visited Puerto Rico in October 1984. All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic Church, most of which are located at the town center or \\"plaza\\".\\r\\nAn Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that \\"more than 70 percent of whom identify themselves as Catholic\\" but provided no source for this information. (It may have been using the 2010 Pew Research Center data.)[41]\\r\\nThe CIA World Factbook however, reports that 85% of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic, while 15% identify as Protestant and Other. Neither a date or a source for that information is provided and may not be recent.[42]\\r\\nIn November 2014, a Pew Research report, with the sub-title Widespread Change in a Historically Catholic Region, indicated that only 56% of Puerto Ricans were Catholic and that 33% were Protestant. This survey was completed between October 2013 and February 2014.\\r\\nProtestantism was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime. For example, the Holy Trinity Anglican church in Ponce, was prevented from ringing its bell until 1898, when American troops landed there.[43] Protestantism increased under American sovereignty, making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries, although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion. The first Protestant church, Iglesia de la Santsima Trinidad, was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872.[44] It was the first non-Roman Catholic Church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas.[45][46]\\r\\nIn 2007, there were over 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico, representing about 0.13% of the population.[47][48] There are eight Islamic mosques spread throughout the island, with most Muslims living in Ro Piedras.[49][50] Puerto Rican converts to Islam continue to occur.[51] \\"Ties between Latinos and Islam are more than just spiritual, but date back to Spanish history. Many people do not realize that Muslims conquered Spain killing many Christians for more than 700 years\\".[52] And at times not just individuals, but whole families convert. However, lack of Muslim education in the Island forces some Puerto Rican Muslims to migrate to the States.[52] Islam was brought into Puerto Rico mainly via the Palestinian migration of the 1950s and '60s.[53] Thus, today there is a strong Palestinian presence among Muslims in Puerto Rico. \\"They are economically strong and are thus able to pay for a full-time Imaam\\".[54]\\r\\nPuerto Rico is also home to the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean with 3,000 Jewish inhabitants.[55] Some Puerto Ricans have converted, not only as individuals but as entire families. Puerto Rico is the only Caribbean island in which the Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements are represented.[7][56]\\r\\nTano religious practices have been rediscovered/reinvented by a handful of advocates. Starting in about 1840, there have been attempts to create a quasi-indigenous Tano identity in rural areas of Puerto Rico.[57][citation needed] This trend accelerated among the Puerto Rican community in the mainland United States in the 1960s.[58] In the 2010 U.S. census, 9,399 people are identified as \\"Tano.\\"[59]\\r\\nVarious African religious practices have been present since the arrival of enslaved Africans. In particular, the Yoruba beliefs of Santera and/or If, and the Kongo-derived Palo Mayombe (sometimes called an African belief system, but rather a way of Bantu lifestyle of Congo origin) find adherence among the few individuals who practice some form of African traditional religion.\\r\\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook unless otherwise indicated.\\r\\nPopulation in 2010:\\r\\nPopulation in 2016:\\r\\nGender:[62]\\r\\nAge structure:\\r\\nInfant mortality rate:\\r\\nLife expectancy at birth:\\r\\nTotal fertility rate:\\r\\nNationality:[63]\\r\\nEthnic Groups (2010):[63]\\r\\nReligions:[37]\\r\\nLanguages:[63]\\r\\nMedian Household Income:[61]\\r\\nIndividuals below the poverty level:[61]\\r\\nEducation, high school graduate or higher:[61]","field3":"What is the dominant religion in puerto rico?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"13,900","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, commonly known as the Nassau Coliseum, and branded as NYCB Live: Home of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum due to a naming rights agreement, is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Uniondale, New York, east of New York City. The Coliseum is approximately 7 miles (11?km) east of the eastern limits of the Borough of Queens of New York City and is conveniently located next to the Meadowbrook Parkway.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpened 46?years ago in 1972,[2] the Coliseum occupies 63 acres (25?ha) of Mitchel Field, a former Army airfield, later an Air Force base. The facility is located in the Town of Hempstead, within the Uniondale 11553 ZIP code. The Coliseum is used for sporting events, concerts, large exhibitions and shows as well as trade shows44,000 square feet (4,100?m2) at the main arena, 60,000 at the Expo Center. In 2015, the arena was temporarily closed for a major renovation which was completed in April 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arena is one of two homes for the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL), serving from 1972 to 2015 and again from 2018 until at least 2021, when the Belmont Park Arena is completed, and was formerly home of the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1972 to 1977; both teams also currently play at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. In 2017, the venue became the new home of the Brooklyn Nets' NBA G League team, the Long Island Nets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coliseum originally had a capacity of 13,000 to 15,000 depending on the event, and in the early 1980s the maximum capacity was increased to around 18,000. Before closing for renovations in 2015 the Coliseum seated 16,170 for hockey, up to 18,511 for concerts and 17,686 for boxing. Those renovations resulted in drastically reduced capacities: 13,900 for hockey, 16,500 for basketball, but still 18,511 for concerts[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coliseum was home to the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association, and later the National Basketball Association, from 1972 to 1977. The first event at the Coliseum was a Nets game against the Pittsburgh Condors on February 11, 1972.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nets won two ABA Championships in the Coliseum, with Hall of Famer Julius Erving headlining the team. In 1973ÿ74 the Nets defeated the Utah Stars in five games to capture their first title. The Nets then captured the final American Basketball Association Championship in 1976, defeating the Denver Nuggets in six games. Following the 1976 season the Nets joined the National Basketball Association as part of the ABAÿNBA merger.[5]\\r\\nAfter their first season in the NBA, the Nets moved to New Jersey. The New Jersey Nets played four seasons at the Rutgers Athletic Center before completion of a new arena at the Meadowlands Sports Complex.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coliseum also hosted the New York Arrows and later the New York Express of the original Major Indoor Soccer League. The Arrows, which existed as a franchise from 1978 to 1984, won the first four MISL championships.[6] The short-lived New York Express played part of the 1986ÿ87 season, ending operations before the All-Star break with financial troubles and a 3-23 record.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn NCAA Division I men's college basketball, the Coliseum hosted the ECAC Metro Region Tournament organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) in 1978, 1979, 1980, and 1981.[8][9][10][11][12] It also has hosted first- and second-round games of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 1982, 1994, and 2001.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York Sets of World Team Tennis played their first match at Nassau Coliseum on May 7, 1974, and won the WTT championships in 1976.[16] The team changed its name to the New York Apples for the 1977 season, and played 12 of its 22 home matches at Madison Square Garden and the Felt Forum, repeating as champions.[17] Prior to the 1978 season, the Apples announced that they would leave the Coliseum and play all their home matches in the Madison Square Garden complex.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York Raiders, intended by the fledgling World Hockey Association to be their flagship franchise, was slated to play in the new Nassau Coliseum in 1972ÿ73. However, the Nassau County government did not consider the WHA a fully professional league and wanted nothing to do with the Raiders.[19] Nassau County retained William Shea to get an NHL team to play in the new building. The NHL responded by hastily awarding a franchise to Long Islandthe New York Islanderswhich forced the Raiders to play in Madison Square Garden, in the shadow of the New York Rangers.[20] On October 7, 1972, the first Islanders game in Nassau Coliseum was played as the Atlanta Flames visited the Islanders. Flames forward Morris Stefaniw scored the first NHL goal in the building at 6:56 of the first period, while Ed Westfall scored the first goal for the Islanders, as the Flames won the game 3ÿ2. The first Islanders' home win at the arena was on October 12, 1972, where they defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3ÿ2. The Islanders' first playoff win at the arena came on April 20, 1975, where they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 4ÿ2. On April 22, 1976, the Islanders earned their first playoff series victory at the arena by defeating the Buffalo Sabres 3ÿ2, and winning the series 4ÿ2.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 8, 1983, the arena hosted the 35th National Hockey League All-Star Game, during which Wayne Gretzky scored four goals in the third period and was honored as the game's most valuable player.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islanders were 11ÿ1 in Stanley Cup Finals games at the Coliseum. Their only loss was a 1ÿ0 setback in Game 1 in 1984 to the Edmonton Oilers. Islanders fans nicknamed the arena \\"Fort Neverlose\\" in honor of the team's strong home record during the finals.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coliseum was home to the New York Saints of the National Lacrosse League from 1989 to 2003.[24] In 2007, it was home to four of the New York Titans National Lacrosse League team's eight home games (along with Madison Square Garden).[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nassau Coliseum hosted minor league hockey prior to the awarding of the Islanders franchise, an event that was brought back in 2005, when the Islanders-affiliated Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the American Hockey League (AHL) played two \\"home\\" games at the Coliseum in the absence of NHL hockey due to the 2004ÿ05 NHL lockout.[26] On April 17ÿ18, 2009, the Sound Tigers played two of their home playoff games against the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins at the Coliseum due to a scheduling conflict at the  Arena at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the team's home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000 and 2005, the Professional Bull Riders brought their Built Ford Tough Series (originally Bud Light Cup) to the Coliseum.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 24ÿ25, 2006, the Coliseum hosted the 44th NYSPHSAA Wrestling Championships.

The game was won by the Islanders 3-1, forcing a Game 7 in Washington. Islanders' Nikolay Kulemin scored the final NHL game-winning goal at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum at 10:33 of the third period, a wrist shot against Braden Holtby. The Islanders' Cal Clutterbuck scored the final NHL goal at the Coliseum, an empty net goal that put the Islanders up 3-1 at 19:07 of the 3rd period.[29][30] However, the Islanders were denied entry into the second round of the playoffs as they lost Game 7 of the series to the Capitals in Washington two nights later, thus making Game 6 the final major-league sporting event held at the Coliseum.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 19ÿ20, 2014, the Global RallyCross Championship raced at the Nassau Coliseum parking lot.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 5, 2015, the Nets announced their new NBA D-League team, the Long Island Nets, would play at the renovated Coliseum starting in 2017 (the team played their first season at their parent team's home, the Barclays Center).[33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 22, 2017, the Coliseum hosted UFC on Fox: Weidman vs. Gastelum.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2018, the Coliseum hosted the New York Open, an ATP 250 men's tennis tournament replacing the long-running Memphis Open.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seating capacity for hockey during the life of the arena has been:\\r\\n\\r\\nElvis Presley performed four sold-out concerts at the Nassau Coliseum on June 22, 23 & 24, 1973.

Frank Zappa played his final U.S. show on March 25, 1988[43] at the Coliseum. He was joined onstage by his son, Dweezil Zappa, for the concert's encores. Pink Floyd performed between August 19 and 23, 1988, on their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. In March 1990, the country supergroup The Highwaymen performed at the Coliseum. Their performance was recorded and was released on VHS in 1991. On June 11, 12 and 13, 1990, Madonna performed three sold-out shows at Nassau Coliseum on her Blond Ambition World Tour. The inside sleeve to Morrissey's 1992 album Your Arsenal was shot at a performance at the Coliseum on November 11, 1991.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arena has hosted WWE Raw and Smackdown events many times and has been a mainstay of WWE for over 30 years. On August 25, 2002, SummerSlam was hosted at the Coliseum. The April 10, 2017 edition of Raw was WWE's first event at the Coliseum following the renovations.[44] In October 2018, the Coliseum will host Evolution, the promotion's first all-women's pay-per-view event.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coliseum also hosted the opening leg of Wrestlemania 2 held on April 7, 1986. As part of an ambitious plan to have Wrestlemania from three separate venues (also used were the Rosemont Horizon in Chicago and the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena), 16,585 fans saw 4 live matches at the Coliseum with the rest of the event shown to the audience by closed-circuit television. The main event at the Nassau leg was actually a boxing match between Rowdy Roddy Piper and tough-guy actor Mr. T.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nScenes for the 2007 movie Music and Lyrics starring Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore were filmed at the arena.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coliseum was the second-oldest arena in active use by a National Hockey League team (after nearby Madison Square Garden), and until the return of the Winnipeg Jets to the league at the 15,004 seat MTS Centre in Winnipeg, was the smallest arena in the NHL by total seating capacity.[48] The arena had been considered obsolete for many years, and various Islanders owners tried to replace it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeam and county officials announced in 2004 a plan called The Lighthouse Project to renovate the Coliseum. The project's centerpiece was a 60-story tower that would look like a lighthouse. Other plans included new housing, athletic facilities, a minor league baseball stadium, restaurants, and a hotel. The project would also add trees, water and other natural elements to the area.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 14, 2007, Islanders owner Charles Wang and the Lighthouse Development Group partnered with Rexcorp to create a new plan. The 60-story \\"lighthouse\\" evolved into two 31-story buildings connected by a footbridge at the top. The project was transformed from a simple renovation of the Coliseum property into a 150-acre (0.61?km2) transformation of surrounding properties. Plans called for more 2,000 residential units (20% affordable housing), a hotel, a convention center, a sports technology center, 500,000 square feet (46,000?m2) of retail space, and a sports complex next to the renovated Coliseum. The overall project was slated to cost roughly $3.75 billion.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction was not planned to begin until at least mid-2009. Nassau County approved the Lighthouse Project in 2006 on a 16ÿ2 vote, and the Draft Environmental Impact Statement was completed after a state-mandated environmental review.[50] The Lighthouse Project was then expected to go before the Town of Hempstead for approval on a change in land zoning.[51] However, the approval was never granted. After the October 2009 deadline passed, the Long Island Press reported the Lighthouse Project's cancellation.[52] Wang has denied the report.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2010, Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had discussions with Wang about constructing an arena for the Islanders near Citi Field. Wilpon has also discussed buying the Islanders.[54] In June 2010, the FanHouse website reported Jeff and Fred Wilpon, the owner of the Mets, began working with real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (who also worked on Madison Square Garden's latest renovation) on a feasibility study of a new Islanders arena in Queens.[55] However, a source from Newsday indicated the FanHouse report was not true.[56] There were also reports businessman Nelson Peltz wanted to buy the Islanders and move them to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 12, 2010, Town Supervisor Kate Murray (R-Hempstead) announced an \\"alternate zone\\" for the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum property that downsized the Lighthouse Project to half its proposed size and made the project, according to Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano and the developers, \\"economically unviable for both the developer and owner of the site.\\" As a result, Wang, Mangano and the developers decided they would no longer pursue the project.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 11, 2011, the Islanders and Nassau County executives announced that county residents would vote on a referendum for approval of a $400 million public bond issue for a new plan to replace the Coliseum. The plan, including the construction of a new $350 million arena as well as a $50 million minor league baseball ballpark nearby, was presented by Wang as a last-ditch effort to keep the Islanders on Long Island.[59] However, voters in Nassau County rejected a proposal by a 57% to 43% margin on August 1, 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 24, 2012, the Islanders announced the team would move to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn after their lease expired at the end of the 2014ÿ2015 season.[60] The Islanders played their final game at the Coliseum on April 25, 2015, beating the Washington Capitals 3-1 in game 6 of the first round of the playoffs against the Washington Capitals forcing a Game 7, held in and won by Washington, ending the Isles' run at the Coliseum; in Game 6 Cal Clutterbuck of the Islanders scored the final NHL goal in the building, an empty netter at 19:07 of the third period.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long after the Islanders announced their move to Brooklyn, Forest City Enterprises, the owner of Barclays Center, was chosen to perform a study on development possibilities for the Nassau Coliseum site.[61] A request for proposal was issued as a result of this study to transform the arena into a smaller sized venue and its surrounding parking lot into an entertainment hub with theaters, sports bars, and retail.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour competing proposals were submitted in May 2013,[62] and Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano selected two finalists in July 2013, including one from a group led by Forest City Ratner. Ratner's proposal called for a reduction of the Coliseum's capacity to 13,000 seats and a revamp of the arena's interior and concrete facade designed by SHoP Architects, the firm which designed the Barclays Center, which would cost the group approximately $89 million. As part of his bid, the Islanders would play 6 games per season in the arena, the Brooklyn Nets would play one exhibition game, and a minor league hockey team would call the arena home.[63][64]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 15, 2013, Nassau County announced Forest City had won the bid for the renovation of the Nassau Coliseum and the surrounding property, pending approval from the Nassau legislature and zoning changes from the Hempstead town government.[65][66] The Nassau legislature unanimously approved the bid on September 24, 2013.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nBilly Joel performed the arena's final pre-renovation concert on August 4, 2015.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 5, 2017, a Billy Joel concert was the arena's first post-renovation event. Other acts that will perform during the new Coliseum's opening week include Stevie Nicks, The Pretenders, Idina Menzel, Lionel Richie, Mariah Carey, and Marc Anthony.[69] Bruno Mars and New Kids on the Block have also been announced.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 4, 2016, it was announced that Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment had reached a naming rights deal with New York Community Bank. The deal with the county mandates the inclusion of \\"Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\\" in the arena's name. The cost of the naming rights and the agreement's length were not disclosed.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 14, 2017, it was announced the closing Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus would perform their last show at the renovated Nassau Coliseum on May 21, 2017.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 15, 2017, the New York Islanders announced that they would play a preseason game against the Philadelphia Flyers on September 17, 2017, which would be their first appearance at the Coliseum in nearly two years.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late January 2017, Bloomberg News reported via internal sources that Barclays Center was considering dropping the Islanders due to poor attendance and their effects on the venue's profits. The venue has received a poor reception as a hockey arena due to poor sight lines and ice conditions, as Barclays was primarily designed as a basketball arena. Newsday reported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with Ledecky, and he told the paper the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum.[33][34] These reports were further elaborated by Long Island Association president Kevin Law in April 2017, who stated that Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment (who manages both venues) was preparing to offer a relocation plan to the team. Law felt that the alternate option of seeking a new arena in Belmont Park was redundant to the renovated Coliseum.[73] The Islanders played a preseason game at the renovated Coliseum on September 17, 2017.[74] The Islanders' lease of Barclays Center is up for renegotiation, and the parties have until January 31, 2018, to opt-out of their current 25-year lease.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe renovation project reduced the capacity of the arena to 13,000, a level which was believed to be unsustainable for an NHL team; in comparison, the Islanders' average attendance at Barclays is 12,059, the lowest in the NHL (Barclays Center is the second-smallest arena in the NHL based on seating capacity, with 15,795which is around 400 seats fewer than the Coliseum pre-renovation).[76][75][74] As such, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman felt that returning wasn't a \\"viable option\\" for the Islanders, but noted that the team was \\"in the process of evaluating what makes the most sense for the franchise and particularly for their fans.\\"[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2017, New York Arena Partners (a venture of the Islanders, Oak View Group, and Sterling Equities) won a bid to construct a new, 18,000-seat arena and mixed-used district at Belmont Park, beating a competing proposal by New York City FC for a new soccer stadium. The new arena is projected to be completed in time for the 2021-22 season.[77][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2018, Islanders owner Jon Ledecky revealed on WFAN's Boomer and Gio that he had toured the renovated Coliseum with Bettman and other senior NHL officials. They assessed that the Islanders could play a limited schedule of home games at the Coliseum, but that it wouldn't be sustainable as a full-time venue because of its capacity and diminished amenities over other newly-built arenas, such as an insufficient number of corporate suites.[79] On January 23, 2018, it was reported that Barclays Center was pushing for a short-term lease under which the Islanders would split their home games between Barclays Center and the Nassau Coliseum until the Belmont Park arena is completed, with the number of games at the Coliseum steadily increasing for each year of the arrangement.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 21, 2018, the Islanders announced that they would play half their home schedule at the Coliseum until Belmont Park Arena is completed.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the Coliseum during a hockey game\\r\\n\\r\\nWestbound on Charles Lindbergh Blvd towards the Nassau Coliseum\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the Coliseum during a hockey game\\r\\n\\r\\nCorner view of the Coliseum\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside view of the Coliseum next to flagpoles\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York Islanders' retired numbers and other banners raised inside the Coliseum\\r\\n\\r\\nColiseum before an Islanders game","field3":"How many seats does nassau coliseum have for hockey?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Neil Donell","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Chicago is an American rock band formed in 1967 in Chicago, Illinois, calling themselves the Chicago Transit Authority in 1968 before shortening the name in 1970. The self-described \\"rock and roll band with horns\\" began writing politically charged rock music, and later moved to a softer sound, generating several hit ballads. The group had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Since at least 2008, Billboard has shown Chicago to be the \\"greatest of all time\\" American band in singles chart success,[1][2][3] and since 2015, the \\"greatest of all time\\" American band in album chart success as well.[4] Chicago is one of the longest-running and most successful rock groups, and one of the world's best-selling groups of all time, having sold more than 100 million records.[5][6] In 1971, Chicago was the first rock act to sell out Carnegie Hall for a week.[7]\\r\\nTo date, Chicago has sold over 40 million units in the U.S., with 23 gold, 18 platinum, and 8 multi-platinum albums.[8][9][10] They have had five consecutive number-one albums on the Billboard 200[11] and 20 top-ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100.[12] They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.[13] In 2017, original band members Peter Cetera, Robert Lamm, and James Pankow were elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame for their songwriting efforts as members of the music group.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group now known as Chicago began on February 15, 1967, at a meeting involving saxophonist Walter Parazaider, guitarist Terry Kath, drummer Danny Seraphine, trombonist James Pankow, trumpet player Lee Loughnane, and keyboardist/singer Robert Lamm. The first five musicians met while students at DePaul University. Lamm was recruited from Roosevelt University. The group was initially named the Big Thing, and like most other groups playing in Chicago nightclubs, this group of six played Top 40 hits. Realizing the need for both a tenor to complement baritones Lamm and Kath, and a bass player because Lamm's use of organ bass pedals did not provide \\"adequate bass sound\\", local tenor and bassist Peter Cetera was invited to join the Big Thing in late 1967.[16]\\r\\nWhile gaining some success as a cover band, the group began working on original songs. In June 1968, at manager James William Guercio's request, the Big Thing moved to Los Angeles, California, and signed with Columbia Records. The band changed its name to Chicago Transit Authority.[5] It was while performing on a regular basis at the Whisky a Go Go nightclub in West Hollywood that the band got exposure to more famous musical artists of the time. Subsequently, they were the opening act for Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix.[17]:77ÿ78,106ÿ107[18] As related to group biographer, William James Ruhlmann, by Walt Parazaider, Jimi Hendrix once told Parazaider, \\"'Jeez, your horn players are like one set of lungs and your guitar player is better than me.'\\"[18]\\r\\nTheir first record (April 1969), Chicago Transit Authority, is a double album, which is rare for a band's first release. The album made it to No. 17 on the Billboard 200 album chart,[11] sold over one million copies by 1970, and was awarded a platinum disc.[19] The album included a number of pop-rock songs ÿ \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\", \\"Beginnings\\", \\"Questions 67 and 68\\", and \\"I'm a Man\\" ÿ which were later released as singles. For this inaugural recording effort the group was nominated for a Grammy Award for 1969 Best New Artist of the Year.[20]\\r\\nAccording to Cetera, the band was booked to perform at Woodstock in 1969, but promoter Bill Graham, with whom they had a contract, exercised his right to reschedule them to play at the Fillmore West on a date of his choosing, and he scheduled them for the Woodstock dates. Santana, which Graham also managed, took Chicago's place at Woodstock,[21] and that performance is considered to be Santana's \\"breakthrough\\" gig.[22] A year later, in 1970, when he needed to replace headliner Joe Cocker, and then Cocker's intended replacement, Jimi Hendrix, Graham booked Chicago to perform at Tanglewood which is considered by some to be a \\"pinnacle\\" performance.[23]\\r\\nAfter the release of their first album, the band's name was shortened to Chicago to avoid legal action being threatened by the actual mass-transit company of the same name.[18]\\r\\nThe band released a second album, titled Chicago (retroactively known as Chicago II), which is another double-LP. The album's centerpiece track is a seven-part, 13-minute suite composed by Pankow called \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon\\". The suite yielded two top ten hits: \\"Make Me Smile\\" (No.?9 U.S.) and \\"Colour My World\\",[12] both sung by Kath. Among the other tracks on the album: Lamm's dynamic but cryptic \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" (Chicago's first Top 5 hit),[12] which is a reference to a songwriter trying to write at 25 or 26 minutes before 4 o'clock in the morning,[24][17]:109[25] and was sung by Cetera with Terry Kath on guitar; the lengthy war-protest song \\"It Better End Soon\\"; and, at the end, Cetera's 1969 moon landing-inspired \\"Where Do We Go from Here?\\"[26] The double-LP album's inner cover includes the playlist, the entire lyrics to \\"It Better End Soon\\", and two declarations: \\"This endeavor should be experienced sequentially\\", and, \\"With this album, we dedicate ourselves, our futures and our energies to the people of the revolution. And the revolution in all of its forms.\\"[27] The album was a commercial success, rising to number four on the Billboard 200,[11] and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1970, and platinum in 1991.[28] The band was nominated for two Grammy Awards as a result of this album, Album of the Year, and Best Contemporary Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus.[20]\\r\\nChicago III, another double LP, was released in 1971 and charted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200.[11] Two singles were released from it: \\"Free\\" from Lamm's \\"Travel Suite\\", which charted at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100;[12] and \\"Lowdown\\", written by Cetera and Seraphine, which made it to No. 40.[12] The album was certified gold by the RIAA in February, 1971, and platinum in November, 1986.[28]\\r\\nThe band released LPs at a rate of at least one album per year from their third album in 1971 on through the 1970s. During this period, the group's album titles primarily consisted of the band's name followed by a Roman numeral, indicating the album's sequence in their canon. The exceptions to this scheme were the band's fourth album, a live boxed set entitled Chicago at Carnegie Hall, their twelfth album Hot Streets, and the Arabic-numbered Chicago 13. While the live album itself did not bear a number, the four discs within the set were numbered Volumes I through IV.\\r\\nIn 1971, the band released Chicago at Carnegie Hall Volumes I, II, III, and IV, a quadruple LP, consisting of live performances, mostly of music from their first three albums, from a week-long run at Carnegie Hall. Chicago was the first rock act to sell out a week at Carnegie Hall and the live recording was made to chronicle that milestone.[7] Along with the four vinyl discs, the packaging contained some strident political messaging about how \\"We [youth] can change The System\\", including wall posters and voter registration information.[29][30] The album went gold \\"out of the box\\" and on to multi-platinum status.[7] William James Ruhlmann says Chicago at Carnegie Hall was \\"perhaps\\" the best-selling box set by a rock act and held that record for 15 years.[7] In recognition of setting Carnegie Hall records and the ensuing four LP live recordings, the group was awarded a Billboard 1972 Trendsetter Award.[31] Drummer Danny Seraphine attributes the fact that none of Chicago's first four albums were issued on single LPs to the productive creativity of this period and the length of the jazz-rock pieces.[32]\\r\\nIn 1972 the band released its first single-disc release, Chicago V, which reached No. 1 on both the Billboard pop[11] and jazz album charts.[citation needed] It features \\"Saturday in the Park\\", written by Robert Lamm, which mixes everyday life and political yearning in a more subtle way. It peaked at No.?3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1972.[33][34] The second single released from the album was the Lamm-composed \\"Dialogue (Part I & II)\\", which featured a musical \\"debate\\" between a political activist (sung by Kath) and a blas college student (sung by Cetera). It peaked at No. 24 on the Hot 100 chart.[12]\\r\\nOther albums and singles followed in each of the succeeding years. 1973's Chicago VI was the first of several albums to include Brazilian jazz percussionist Laudir de Oliveira[35] and saw Cetera emerge as the main lead singer. According to William James Ruhlmann, de Oliveira was a \\"sideman\\" on Chicago VI, and became an official member of the group in 1974.[35] Chicago VI featured two top ten singles,[12] \\"Just You 'n' Me\\", written by Pankow, and \\"Feelin' Stronger Every Day\\", written by Pankow and Cetera. Chicago VII was the band's double-disc 1974 release. Three singles were released from this album: \\"(I've Been) Searchin' So Long\\", written by Pankow, and \\"Call On Me\\", written by Loughnane, which both made it into the top ten;[12] and the Beach Boys-infused \\"Wishing You Were Here\\", written by Cetera, which peaked at number eleven.[12] Their 1975 release, Chicago VIII, featured the political allegory \\"Harry Truman\\" (No. 13, Top 100 chart) and the nostalgic Pankow-composed \\"Old Days\\" (No. 5, Top 100 chart).[36][37] That summer also saw a joint tour across America with the Beach Boys,[35] with the two acts performing separately, then coming together for a finale.[38] Chicago VI, VII and VIII all made it to No. 1 on the Billboard 200,[11] all were certified gold the years they were released, and all have since been certified platinum. Chicago VI was certified two times multi-platinum in 1986.[39] Chicago IX: Chicago's Greatest Hits was released in 1975 and became the band's fifth consecutive No. 1 album on the Billboard 200.[11]\\r\\n1976's Chicago X features Cetera's ballad \\"If You Leave Me Now\\", which held the top spot in the U.S. charts for two weeks[40] and the UK charts for three weeks.[41] It was the group's first No. 1 single,[35] and won Chicago their only Grammy Award to date,[42] the 1976 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus, at the 19th Annual Grammy Awards held on February 19, 1977.[43] The single was certified gold by the RIAA the same year of its release.[44] The song almost did not make the cut for the album.[35] \\"If You Leave Me Now\\" was recorded at the very last minute. The success of the song, according to William James Ruhlmann, foreshadowed a later reliance on ballads.[35] The album was commercially successful. It reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200,[11] was certified both gold and platinum by the RIAA the same year of its release and two times multi-platinum since,[45] and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.[20] 1976 was the first year that albums were certified platinum by the RIAA.[46] Chicago X was the first platinum album for Columbia Records, which awarded the group a 25-pound bar of pure platinum, made by Cartier, to mark the event.[47] (Billboard magazine reported it as a 30-pound bar.)[48] At the 4th Annual American Music Awards, a fan-voted awards show,[49] held January 31, 1977, Chicago won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group, the group's first of two American Music Awards they have received.[50]\\r\\nThe group's 1977 release, Chicago XI, includes Cetera's ballad \\"Baby, What a Big Surprise\\", a No. 4 U.S. hit which became the group's last top 10 hit of the decade.[12] Chicago XI performed well commercially, peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard 200,[11] and reaching platinum status during the year of its release.[39]\\r\\nBesides recording and touring, during the busy 1970s Chicago also made time for a movie appearance and several television appearances of note. In 1972, Guercio produced and directed Electra Glide in Blue, a film about an Arizona motorcycle policeman. Released in 1973, the film stars Robert Blake and features Cetera, Kath, Loughnane, and Parazaider in supporting roles.[51] The group also appears prominently on the film's soundtrack. Chicago made its \\"television variety debut\\" in February 1973 when they were the only rock musicians invited to appear on a television special honoring Duke Ellington, \\"Duke Ellington ... We Love You Madly,\\" which aired on CBS. They performed the Ellington composition, \\"Jump for Joy.\\"[52][53][54] In July 1973 the group starred in a half-hour television special produced by Dick Clark, Chicago in the Rockies, which aired in prime time on ABC. The show was filmed on location at Caribou Ranch, the 3,000 acre ranch-turned-recording studio located outside of Boulder, Colorado, owned by Chicago's producer, James William Guercio. The only musical guest on the show was Al Green, who was rated the number-one male vocalist of 1972, and whom Rolling Stone magazine named \\"Rock and Roll Star of the Year.\\"[55] That special was followed by a second hour-long special the next year, Chicago ... Meanwhile Back at the Ranch, which aired in prime time on ABC in August 1974. Chicago ... Meanwhile Back at the Ranch was again shot on location at Caribou Ranch and was again produced by Dick Clark. Singer Anne Murray and country music star Charlie Rich were guests on the show.[56] Clark produced a third television special starring Chicago, Chicago's New Year's Rockin' Eve 1975, which aired on ABC on December 31, 1974. Musical guests on the ?1?1?2-hour-long show included the Beach Boys, the Doobie Brothers, Olivia Newton-John, and Herbie Hancock. It was the third \\"Rockin' Eve\\" Clark had produced, and it competed with Guy Lombardo's traditional New Year's Eve television show which aired on a different network and was in its 45th consecutive year of broadcast. Clark hoped the \\"Rockin' Eve\\" format would become an \\"annual TV custom\\".[57]\\r\\nThe year 1978 began with a split with Guercio.[35] Chicago had recorded its last five studio albums Chicago VI, VII, VIII, X, and XI,[58] and had made two television specials at Guercio's Caribou Ranch. In later years, band members would cite Guercio's purchase of Caribou Ranch, more particularly their realization that Guercio had enough money to purchase Caribou Ranch, as a contributing factor to their disillusionment with him as a producer. They felt he had taken advantage of them financially.[17]:131[59] Then on January 23 of that same year, Kath died of an accidental, self-inflicted gunshot wound from a gun he thought was unloaded.[60][61] Doc Severinsen, who was the bandleader for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson at the time and a friend of the group, visited them after Kath's funeral and encouraged them to continue. According to writer Jim Jerome, the visit \\"snapped them back\\" and helped them make the decision to carry on.[62]\\r\\nAfter auditioning over 30 potential replacements for Kath, Chicago decided upon guitarist and singer-songwriter Donnie Dacus.[62][60] While filming for the musical Hair, he joined the band in April 1978 just in time for the Hot Streets album.[62] Its energetic lead-off single, \\"Alive Again\\", brought Chicago back to the Top 15;[12] Pankow wrote it \\"originally as a love song but ultimately as recognition of Kath's guiding spirit shining down from above.\\"[63]\\r\\nThe 1978 album Hot Streets was produced by Phil Ramone.[62][60] It was Chicago's first album with a title rather than a number; and was the band's first LP to have a picture of the band (shot by photographer Norman Seeff)[64] featured prominently on the cover (with the ubiquitous logo downsized).[62][60] These two moves were seen by many as indications that the band had changed following Kath's death.[62] To a degree, the band returned to the old naming scheme on its subsequent releases, although most titles would now bear Arabic numerals rather than Roman numerals. Hot Streets, the band's 12th album, peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard charts;[11] it was Chicago's first release since their debut to fail to make the Top 10. The release also marked a move somewhat away from the jazz-rock direction favored by Kath and towards more pop songs and ballads. Dacus stayed with the band through the 1979 album Chicago 13,[60] and is also featured in a promotional video on the DVD included in the Rhino Records Chicago box set from 2003. Again produced by Ramone, it was the group's first studio album not to contain a Top 40 hit. Dacus departed from the band shortly after the album's release.\\r\\nChicago XIV (1980), produced by Tom Dowd, relegated the horn section to the background on a number of tracks, and the album's two singles failed to make the Top 40. Chris Pinnick joined the band to play guitar and remained through 1985,[60] and the band were also augmented by saxophone player Marty Grebb on the subsequent tour.[65] Marty Grebb had formerly been with the Buckinghams, and before that had been Cetera's bandmate in a local Chicago area cover band called the Exceptions.[66] The album peaked at No. 71 on the Billboard 200,[11] and failed to reach gold certification by the RIAA.[39] Believing the band to no longer be commercially viable, Columbia Records dropped them from its roster in 1981 and released a second \\"Greatest Hits\\" volume (also known as Chicago XV) later that year to fulfill its contractual obligation.[60]\\r\\nIn late 1981, the band had a new producer (David Foster),[60] a new label (Warner Bros. Records),[60] and the addition of keyboardist, guitarist, and singer Bill Champlin (Sons of Champlin).[67] Percussionist Laudir de Oliveira and Marty Grebb departed from the band. During Foster's stewardship, less of an emphasis was placed on the band's horn-based sound, being replaced by lush power ballads, which became Chicago's style during the 1980s. The new sound brought more singles success to the band.\\r\\nFor the 1982 album Chicago 16, the band worked with composers from outside the group for the first time, and Foster brought in studio musicians for some tracks (including the core members of Toto),[67] and used new technology (such as synthesizers) to \\"update\\" and streamline the sound, further pushing back the horn section, and in some cases not even using them at all. The band did return to the charts with the Cetera-sung ballad \\"Hard to Say I'm Sorry/Get Away\\", which is featured in the soundtrack of the Daryl Hannah film Summer Lovers.[68] Co-written by Cetera and David Foster, \\"Hard to Say I'm Sorry\\" was the group's second single to reach No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart[12] and brought them a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.[20] Chicago 16 reached both gold and platinum status during the year of its release,[39] and went to No. 9 on the Billboard 200 album chart.[11]\\r\\n1984's Chicago 17 became the biggest selling album in the band's history, certified by the RIAA in 1997 as six times multi-platinum.[69] The album produced two more Top Ten (both No. 3) singles,[70] \\"You're the Inspiration\\", written by Cetera and David Foster, and \\"Hard Habit to Break\\", written by?Steve Kipner?and John Lewis Parker. The single, \\"Hard Habit to Break\\", brought two more Grammy Award nominations for the band, for Record of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[20] The album included two other singles: \\"Stay the Night\\" (No. 16),[12] another composition by Cetera and Foster; and \\"Along Comes a Woman\\" (No. 14),[12] written by Cetera and Mark Goldenberg. Peter's brother, Kenny Cetera, who had provided background vocals on the Chicago 17 album,[71] was brought into the group for the 17 tour to add percussion and high harmony vocals.[72]\\r\\nBy 1985, the band was embracing the newest medium, the music video channel MTV, by releasing music videos for four songs. They featured a track titled \\"Good for Nothing\\" on the 1985 global activist album, We Are the World.[73] As contributors to the album, along with all other artists who were on the album, the band received its last nomination for a Grammy Award, for Album of the Year.[20]\\r\\nAt the 13th Annual American Music Awards, held January 27, 1986, Chicago won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group for the second time.[50] It is the last American Music Award the band has received.\\r\\nConcurrently with Chicago's existing career, lead vocalist Peter Cetera had begun a solo career. He proposed an arrangement with the band where they would take hiatuses after tours to let him focus on solo work (mirroring that of Phil Collins and Genesis), but the band declined. Cetera ultimately left Chicago in the summer of 1985. He soon topped the charts with \\"Glory of Love\\" (the theme song of the film The Karate Kid Part II), and with \\"The Next Time I Fall\\" (a duet with Amy Grant). Two more songs reached the Top Ten: a 1988 solo hit called \\"One Good Woman\\" (No. 4 U.S.), and a 1989 duet with Cher called \\"After All\\" (No. 6 U.S.). In 1992, Cetera released his fourth studio album, World Falling Down, which earned him three hits on the Adult Contemporary charts, including the single \\"Restless Heart\\". Cetera's former position was filled by bassist and singer-songwriter Jason Scheff, son of Elvis Presley's bassist Jerry Scheff.[74] Guitarist Chris Pinnick also left the group prior to the recording of the band's next album.\\r\\nFor the final Foster-produced album, Chicago 18, the band filled Pinnick's spot with several session guitarists, none of whom became band members. The album was released on September 29, 1986,[75] and included the No. 3 single \\"Will You Still Love Me?\\", and Top 20 Pop song \\"If She Would Have Been Faithful...\\", in addition to an updated version of \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" with a video that got airplay on MTV. Soon after the album was recorded, the band hired guitarist Dawayne Bailey,[76][77] formerly of Bob Seger's Silver Bullet Band.[78] Bailey and Scheff had previously played in bands together, so Scheff introduced Bailey to the band in time for the Chicago 18 tour.\\r\\nFor the 1988 release, Chicago 19, the band had replaced producer Foster with co-producers Ron Nevison, who had recently produced two albums for Heart, and Chas Sanford, who had worked with Rod Stewart and Stevie Nicks.[79] They topped the charts again with the Diane Warren-composed single \\"Look Away\\". It was the third and last Chicago single to reach No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart.[12] The song ultimately was named as the \\"Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 Song of the Year\\" for 1989.[80] The album also yielded two more Top 10 hits, \\"I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love\\" and \\"You're Not Alone\\",[12] both with Champlin singing solo lead for the first time, and the Scheff-sung No. 55 single, \\"We Can Last Forever,\\" in addition to including the original version of a Top 5 single titled \\"What Kind Of Man Would I Be?\\". The latter, also sung by Scheff, was remixed for inclusion on the band's forthcoming greatest hits record (and 20th album), Greatest Hits 1982ÿ1989, and it was this version that became a hit.\\r\\nThe beginning of the 1990s brought yet another departure. Original drummer Danny Seraphine left Chicago in May 1990.[81] Seraphine was succeeded by Tris Imboden,[81] a longtime drummer with Kenny Loggins[82] and former session drummer with Peter Cetera.[83] Imboden made his first appearance on the 1991 album Twenty 1 with a fragment of band's logo, which yielded an eleven-week stretch on the Billboard 200, a peak at No. 66,[84] and the song \\"Chasin' the Wind\\" which peaked at No. 39. Twenty 1 would be their last released album of original music for fifteen years.\\r\\nThe band was recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on July 23, 1992.[85]\\r\\nIn 1993, Chicago wrote and recorded their 22nd album Stone of Sisyphus.[86] This album was to have marked their return to their traditional composition of the 1970s, emphasizing major horn accompaniment.[87] However, following a reorganization of the record company, the new executives at Reprise Records (now part of the newly formed Warner Music Group) rejected the completed album. It remained unpublished for fifteen years, aside from bootleg tapes and Internet files.[86] This contributed to the parting of the band from the record label. The band was dismayed by the failure of the label. Upset with the shelving of the album, Dawayne Bailey left the group in late 1994, leading to many years of debates and conjecture about the events surrounding the recordings. It was also suggested some years later that the band's management was negotiating with the label regarding a licensing of the extensive Chicago back catalog, and when those talks stalled, the label apparently retaliated by scrapping the project.[87] The album eventually saw an expanded release on Rhino Records in June 2008 to favorable reviews from both fans and critics and made it to No. 122 on the album charts.[11]\\r\\nAfter finishing their 1994 tour, and after signing with the Warner Bros. Records' imprint label Giant Records, they released their 1995 album Night & Day: Big Band,[88] consisting of covers of songs originally recorded by Sarah Vaughan, Glenn Miller, and Duke Ellington. Guitarist Bruce Gaitsch stepped in and joined the band to handle the album's guitar work.[89][90][91] The album featured guest appearances by Paul Shaffer of David Letterman fame, Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, and The Gipsy Kings.[92] Walter Parazaider cited the group's participation in the 1973 television special honoring Duke Ellington, \\"Duke Ellington ... We Love You Madly\\", as key in their decision to record this album.[93] In early 1995 Keith Howland, who had been a studio musician and stage hand based in Los Angeles, was recruited as Chicago's new permanent guitarist.[94]\\r\\nIn 1998, Chicago released Chicago XXV: The Christmas Album and a live album in 1999, Chicago XXVI.\\r\\nIn 2000, the band licensed their entire recorded output to Rhino Records, after having recorded it at Columbia Records and Warner Bros. Records. In 2002, Rhino released a two-disc compilation, The Very Best of Chicago: Only The Beginning, which spanned the band's career. The compilation made the Top 40 and sold over 2 million copies in the U.S. Rhino also began releasing remastered versions of all of the band's Columbia-era albums.\\r\\nThe American cable music channel VH1 featured the band in an episode of its Behind the Music series, \\"Chicago: Behind the Music,\\" season 1, episode 133. The episode first aired on October 15, 2000.[95]\\r\\nOn March 21, 2006, their first all-new studio album since Twenty 1 arrived with Chicago XXX. It was produced by Jay DeMarcus, bassist/vocalist with the country trio Rascal Flatts,[96] who was a long-time fan of Chicago and had cited the group as an influence on him as a musician in a previous fan letter to Jason Scheff.[97] It also marked the first time the band's music was available as a digital download. The album peaked at No. 41 in the U.S.,[11] spawning two minor adult contemporary hits: \\"Feel\\" and \\"Love Will Come Back\\". Two songs from this album, \\"Feel\\" and \\"Caroline\\", were performed live during Chicago's fall 2005 tour.\\r\\nChicago made multi-week appearances at the MGM Grand Las Vegas in March, May and October 2006.[96][98] In July 2006, the band made a series of U.S. appearances with Huey Lewis and the News.[99]\\r\\nOn October 2, 2007, Rhino Records released the two-disc The Best of Chicago: 40th Anniversary Edition (Chicago XXXI), a new greatest hits compilation spanning their entire forty years, similar to The Very Best of: Only the Beginning, released four years earlier.\\r\\nIn 2008, Stone of Sisyphus ÿ once known as the aborted Chicago XXII, now listed officially as Chicago XXXII ÿ was released with an expanded format.[86][87]\\r\\nIn 2009, Chicago again toured with Earth, Wind & Fire.[100]\\r\\nDrew Hester, who was the percussionist and drummer for the Foo Fighters, joined the band in January 2009 to temporarily fill in for an ill Imboden,[101] and continued with the band as a percussionist upon Imboden's return later in the year.[102] In August 2009, Champlin was fired from the band.[103] He was replaced by Grammy-nominated keyboardist Lou Pardini, who had worked with Stevie Wonder and Santana.[104]\\r\\nIn 2010 Chicago toured with the Doobie Brothers.[105] A 2011 performance in Chicago became a video for the HDNet cable channel that featured the Doobie Brothers joining Chicago for three encore tunes.[106] The band also appeared on the season nine finale of American Idol.[107] On July 24, 2011, the band performed at Red Rocks in Colorado, accompanied by the Colorado Symphony Orchestra.[108]\\r\\nWith Chicago XXXIII: O Christmas Three, the band re-teamed with producer Ramone (he had previously released the new tracks for the expanded Christmas re-release What's It Gonna Be, Santa?) to record a new Christmas album.[109] Dolly Parton was a guest artist on the album,[109] which was released in October 2011. In the meantime, Rhino released Chicago XXXIV: Live in '75, a two-disc set containing two hours of previously unreleased performances recorded June 24ÿ26, 1975 at the Capital Centre in Largo, Maryland, featuring the original members of Chicago performing some of their greatest hits up to that point. In 2012, Chicago and the Doobie Brothers held another joint tour.[110] That same year, Hester left the group shortly before the tour,[102] and was succeeded, first by percussionist Daniel de los Reyes,[111][112] then by Daniel's brother and former long-term Santana member, Walfredo Reyes Jr.[111][113][114]\\r\\nIn 2013 Robert Lamm, Lee Loughnane, James Pankow, and Walter Parazaider appeared in the HBO movie Clear History as the band Chicago.[115] In late 2013, the band began releasing singles for a new album, starting with \\"Somethin' Comin', I Know\\" in August, \\"America\\" in September, \\"Crazy Happy\\" in December 2013, and \\"Naked in the Garden of Allah\\" in January 2014. The album, titled Chicago XXXVI: Now, was released on July 4, 2014.[116]\\r\\nIn 2015, Chicago was listed among the nominees for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[117] The original lineup was inducted at the 31st annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony on April 8, 2016 along with N.W.A., Deep Purple, Steve Miller, and Cheap Trick.[118] In February 2016, it was announced that original drummer Danny Seraphine would join the current lineup of Chicago for the first time in over 25 years for the Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony.[119] Peter Cetera chose not to attend.[120] Terry Kath's daughter Michelle accepted her father's award.[120] In July 2016, Chicago performed on ABC's Greatest Hits.[121][122]\\r\\nAfter taking a temporary leave in May 2016, citing \\"family health reasons\\",[123][124] it was announced on October 25, 2016 that Jason Scheff had left Chicago after 31 years.[123][125] Bassist/vocalist Jeff Coffey, who had been filling in for Scheff during his absence, was promoted to a full-time member.[126] Touring saxophonist Ray Herrmann also became an official member at that time.\\r\\nIn January 2017, CNN Films aired a 2-hour biographical documentary film on the group titled Now More Than Ever: The History of Chicago.[127] The film was directed and edited by Peter Pardini, nephew of band member Lou Pardini, and produced by the band, Chicago.[128] The film was the highest rated program in its premiere in the 25-54 demographic and has a 7.1 rating on IMDB.[129] The film won the 2016 \\"Best of the Fest\\" Audience Choice Award at the Sedona International Film Festival.[130] At the 10th Annual Fort Myers Beach Film Festival in 2016, it won the \\"People's Choice\\" award and Peter Pardini won the \\"Rising Star Award\\" as director and filmmaker.[131]\\r\\nOn February 22, 2017 it was announced that Peter Cetera, Robert Lamm, and James Pankow are among the 2017 Songwriters Hall of Fame inductees for their songwriting efforts as members of the music group, Chicago.[14][15] The induction event was held Thursday, June 15 at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City.[14]\\r\\nChicago's website stated that in 2017, the band was working on a new album, Chicago XXXVII.[132] No other information has yet to be provided on a new album including whether the April 2018 release of Chicago: VI Decades Live, a 4 CD/1 DVD Box Set, is to be considered Chicago XXXVII.\\r\\nOn September 17, 2017, former percussionist Laudir de Oliveira died of a heart attack while performing onstage in his native Rio de Janeiro.[133][134]\\r\\nChicago began their 2018 touring schedule on Saturday, January 13 by performing the grand opening concert at the new Xcite Center in Bensalem, Pennsylvania.[135]\\r\\nOn Wednesday, January 17, 2018, drummer Tris Imboden announced he was leaving the band to spend more time with his family.[136] On Friday, January 19, 2018, bassist and vocalist Jeff Coffey announced on his Facebook page that he was also departing from the band due to its heavy touring schedule.[136] Chicago announced that percussionist Walfredo Reyes, Jr. was moving over to drums, replacing Imboden.[137] Vocalist Neil Donell, of Chicago tribute band Brass Transit, was chosen as the band's new lead singer and session musician Brett Simons also joined the band as their new bassist.[138][139] Daniel de los Reyes' return to the percussion position was announced, filling the vacancy left by his brother's move to the drumset.[140][141]\\r\\nIn May 2018, it was revealed that percussionist Daniel de los Reyes was departing Chicago to go back to his other group, the Zac Brown Band.[142] On Thursday, May 17, 2018, Chicago announced on their official Facebook page and on their Twitter account that \\"Ray\\" Ramon Yslas had joined the band on percussion.\\r\\nUpon being renamed from Chicago Transit Authority to Chicago, the band sported a new logo. Its inspiration was found in the design of the Coca-Cola logo,[143][144][145] in the attitude of the city of Chicago itself,[146] and in the desire to visually transcend the individual identities of the band's members.[143] It was designed[146] by the Art Director of Columbia/CBS Records, John Berg,[143][144][145] with each album's graphic art work being done by Nick Fasciano.[147][148] Berg said, \\"The Chicago logo...was fashioned for me by Nick Fasciano from my sketch.\\"[143]\\r\\nThe logo would serve as the band's chief visual icon from Chicago II, onward. In various artistic forms and visual similes, it has been the subject of every subsequent album cover, except the fifteenth album, Greatest Hits, Volume II. For example, it appeared as an American flag on III, a piece of wood on V, a U.S. dollar bill on VI, a leather relief on VII, an embroidered patch on VIII, a chocolate bar on X, a map on XI, a building on 13, a fingerprint on XIV, a computer silicon chip on 16, a parcel on 17, a mosaic on 18, and an aquarelle on 19. Chicago IX's incarnation was a caricature of the band itself, in the shape of the logo.\\r\\nThe album cover series has endured as a cataloged work of art in its own right, described by Paul Nini of the American Institute of Graphic Arts as a \\"real landmark in record cover design\\".[143] In 2013, the iconic status of Chicago's album art was featured in a New York art museum exhibit, which centered upon ninety-five album covers completely selected from John Berg's career portfolio of hundreds. Having overseen the design of approximately fourteen Chicago album covers across more than twenty years, Berg stated that this artistic success resulted from the combination of Chicago's \\"unique situation\\" and his position in \\"the best possible job at the best possible time to have that job, at the center of the graphic universe\\".[144] Berg won the 1976 Grammy Award for Best Album Package for Chicago X, one of four Grammy Awards he won in his lifetime.[149]\\r\\nThe book titled Type and Image: The Language of Graphic Design described the logo as \\"a warm vernacular form, executed in thick script letters with Victorian swashes in the tradition of sports teams and orange crate labels.\\" The book mentions the cultural and material background of the city of Chicago as inspiration for the logo; for example, describing the leather embossing of Chicago VII as representative of the great fire and the stockades. The author connects the album art to the atmosphere of the band's namesake city, quoting the band's original manager, James William Guercio: \\"The printed word can never aspire to document a truly musical experience, so if you must call them something, speak of the city where all save one were born; where all of them were schooled and bred, and where all of this incredible music went down barely noticed; call them CHICAGO.\\"[146]\\r\\nThe four remaining original members of Chicago are Robert Lamm, Lee Loughnane, James Pankow and Walter Parazaider. According to reports published in 2017, Parazaider has retired from touring but is still a member.[150][151][152]\\r\\nBillboard awards\\r\\nPlayboy awards\\r\\nOther honors","field3":"Who is currently the lead singer of chicago?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"October 18, 1988","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nRoseanne is  an American television sitcom starring Roseanne Barr and revolves around the fictional Conner family. It aired on ABC from October 18, 1988, to May 20, 1997, and again on March 27, 2018, through May 22, 2018. Lauded for its realistic portrayal of a working-class American family, the series reached No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings from 1989 to 1990.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series remained in the top four for six of its nine seasons, and in the top 20 for eight. In 1993, the episode \\"A Stash from the Past\\" was ranked No. 21 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.[1] In 2002, Roseanne was ranked No. 35 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[2] In 2013, it was ranked No. 32 on TV Guide's 60 Best Series of All Time.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 16, 2017, ABC announced it had greenlit a revived, 10th season of Roseanne as a mid-season replacement in 2018, with the original cast returning. In November 2017, ABC requested an additional episode, bringing the total to nine.[4][5] It premiered on March 27, 2018, to an initial audience of 18.44 million, which grew to 27.26 million total viewers following 7 days of delayed viewing. On March 30, 2018, following the success of its premiere, Roseanne was renewed for an eleventh season of thirteen episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nABC reversed its renewal decision and canceled Roseanne on May 29, 2018 after Barr likened former Obama administration official Valerie Jarrett to Planet of the Apes, in a comment considered racist on Twitter which was described by the network's president as being \\"abhorrent, repugnant, and inconsistent with our values.\\"[6][7][8][9][10][11] On June 21, 2018, ABC announced plans to re-tool the show as a spin-off involving the Conner family without Roseanne Barr. The show has a working title The Conners.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn coming up with ideas for new shows, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner of Carsey-Werner Productions decided to look into the concept of the working mother as a central voice.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] Up until that point, there had been countless shows with working mothers, but few treated them as anything other than an adjunct to the father in the family. Werner had suggested that they take a chance on Barr whom they had seen on The Tonight Show. This was because he saw the unique \\"in your face\\" voice that they were looking for and he contacted her agent and offered her the role. Barr's act at the time was the persona of the \\"domestic goddess\\", but as Carsey and Werner explains, she had the distinctive voice and attitude for the character and she was able to transform herself into the working class heroine they envisioned.[21] Many early scripts were written by women: Grace McKeaney, Lauren Eve Anderson, and Laurie Gelman, and directed by Ellen Gittelsohn.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series is centered on the Conners, an American working-class family struggling to get by on a limited household income in their home at 714 Delaware Street in the drab fictional mid-state exurb of Lanford, Illinois. Although initially nominally located in Fulton County, several hours away from Chicago, later on-air references over the years suggested the town is in the vicinity of Aurora, Elgin, and DeKalb, all of which are much closer to Chicago. In a 2018 interview, Barr stated that the series setting was based on Elgin.[23] The family consisted of outspoken Roseanne, married to husband Dan, and their three children: Becky, Darlene, and DJ. Later in the series, Roseanne becomes pregnant again and gives birth to a boy named Jerry Garcia Conner.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany critics considered the show notable as one of the first sitcoms to realistically portray a blue-collar American family with two parents working outside the home, as well as lead characters who were noticeably overweight without their weight being the target of jokes.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstablishing shots were photographed in Evansville, Indiana, the hometown of first-season producer Matt Williams. Exterior shots of the Conner household were based on a real home located in Evansville, located at 619 S. Runnymeade Avenue, a few blocks from Williams' alma mater, the University of Evansville.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nBarr's real-life brother and sister are gay, which inspired her to push for introducing gay characters and issues into the show. \\"My show seeks to portray various slices of real life, and homosexuals are a reality,\\" said Barr.[27] Provocative storylines have been an integral part of the series throughout its existence; Barr has stated that they were issues that working-class Americans experience in their everyday lives and that very few scripted programs ever address them.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoseanne (Roseanne Barr) is a line worker at Wellman Plastics, along with her sister Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) and friend Crystal (Natalie West). Jackie has a brief relationship with Booker (George Clooney), the foreman at Wellman. Dan (John Goodman) finds sporadic work as a construction contractor and faces a strained relationship with his irresponsible and womanizing father (Ned Beatty). Roseanne's parents, Beverly (Estelle Parsons) and Al (John Randolph), consider moving to Lanford, but eventually decide against it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTomboy Darlene (Sara Gilbert) struggles with her femininity as she enters puberty and gets her first period. Becky (Lecy Goranson) faces dating problems with her first boyfriend Chip (Jared Rushton), who is introduced in the \\"Lover's Lane\\" episode. Season one also finds the Conners experiencing, and surviving, a tornado. In the \\"Death and Stuff\\" episode a door-to-door salesman dies in the Conners' kitchen, and in the season finale, Roseanne stands up to a new foreman (Fred Thompson), when she leads Jackie, Crystal, and other coworkers as they quit Wellman Plastics. DJ is played by Sal Barone in the pilot episode and by Michael Fishman for the remainder of the series. There is a running gag in this season where they use the word \\"corn\\" in every episode.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther notable guest stars during the season include Bill Sadler as Dwight, Dan's friend, Robert Harper as Chip's father, Andrea Walters as Chip's mother, and Tony Crane as \\"The Tongue Bandit\\", Becky's other boyfriend. Bill Pentland, Roseanne Barr's first husband, made a cameo as one of Dan's friends in the \\"Saturday\\" episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that they've quit Wellman Plastics, Roseanne and Jackie must find new jobs. Jackie decides to become a police officer. Roseanne cycles through a variety of menial jobs including telemarketer, secretary for Dan's boss, bartender, cashier at a fast-food restaurant, and, finally, sweeping floors at a beauty parlor. At home, Dan's poker buddy Arnie (Tom Arnold) makes a startling debut when he plants a passionate kiss on Roseanne. The Conners celebrate an outrageous Halloween that becomes an annual feature of the series. Roseanne wants 10 minutes to herself in the bathroom; this turns into a bizarre dream sequence which has the entire cast singing parodies of songs from musical comedies. Later, at Thanksgiving dinner, Dan takes wary notice of a growing romance between his father and Crystal. Jackie gets serious with new boyfriend Gary (Brian Kerwin). Becky repeatedly rebels against Roseanne and Dan's parental authority such as staying out late and breaking into the liquor cabinet with her friend Dana and getting drunk when Dan and Roseanne are out of town for the day. The reappearance of old biker buddy Ziggy (Jay O. Sanders) reminds Roseanne and Dan of their own rebellious past. Darlene first proves her talent for writing when she wins recognition for her poetry. Roseanne's own writing talents are given a boost when her family fixes up a basement room to serve as a writer's den. This is the first season where we hear Roseanne thinking out loud.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther notable guest stars during the season include Stephen Dorff as Becky's boyfriend Jimmy, Jenny Lewis as Becky's friend Diane, Stephen Root as Roseanne's lawyer Peter, and Bert Parks as a judge. Ann Wedgeworth played Dan Conner's mother in the Thanksgiving episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season opens with the Conner women confronting the issue of pregnancy: Roseanne takes a pregnancy test that turns up negative. Roseanne takes on a job as waitress in the restaurant at Rodbell's Department Store, where she meets Leon (Martin Mull) and Bonnie (Bonnie Sheridan). Jackie gets injured on the job, which results in her breaking up with her boyfriend Gary. Becky begins dating Mark Healy (Glenn Quinn); when her parents forbid her to see him, she temporarily moves in with Jackie. Dan is floored to learn his father Ed and Crystal plan to marry; Crystal is pregnant with Ed's baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoseanne locks horns with snooty new neighbor Kathy (Meagen Fay). Nana Mary (Shelley Winters) makes her first appearance at a family barbecue. In the season finale, Ziggy reappears, proposing to open a motorcycle repair shop with Dan and Roseanne. While they are in the process of getting the business off the ground, Ziggy decides to leave because he doesn't want to feel responsible if the business fails. However, he leaves enough money for Dan to open it by himself. We never hear about him again.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther notable guest stars during the season include Dann Florek as Principal Hiller, Leonardo DiCaprio as Darlene's classmate, Brad Garrett as Doug, Judy Gold as Amy, Alyson Hannigan as Becky's friend Jan, and Tobey Maguire as Jeff.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening credits of Season 4 change from Season 3 in that the show now stars \\"Roseanne Arnold\\" instead of \\"Roseanne Barr\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season starts with Becky surprising Roseanne by asking for birth-control pills. Dan and Roseanne begin their new motorcycle repair shop business, Lanford Custom Cycle, while Roseanne continues to work at Rodbell's Department Store. Darlene meets David Healy (Johnny Galecki), brother of Mark (in his first appearance, the character was known as Kevin). After a brief stint working at a perfume counter, Jackie decides to become a truck driver. Nancy (Sandra Bernhard) is introduced as Arnie's fiancee. After a night of heavy drinking, Jackie discovers she slept with the newly engaged Arnie. Darlene undergoes a personality shift into a sullen goth teen. Booker makes a surprise appearance at a Halloween party. Roseanne's neighbor Kathy moves back to Chicago. Roseanne gets breast reduction surgery. Crystal gives birth to Dan's new half-brother, \\"Little Ed\\". Roseanne and Dan accompany Arnie and Nancy to their wedding in Las Vegas. At the end of the season, Lanford Custom Cycle fails, and Rodbell's Luncheonette closes. Nancy is left alone after Arnie is \\"abducted by aliens\\".[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable guest stars during the season include Bob Hope as himself, Jena Malone as little girl on Santa's lap, Wayne Newton as himself, David Crosby as Duke, Bonnie Sheridan as Roseanne's coworker Bonnie, Neil Patrick Harris as Dr. Doogie Howser, and Rick Dees as Ken.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the bike shop closes, Mark decides to move to Minnesota. Becky decides to go with him, and they elope. Jackie and Roseanne each get a check for $10,000 from their mother after she and their father divorce. They, along with Nancy, decide to open a diner but can only get the money they need after Bev agrees to become a partner as well. Nancy comes out as a lesbian. The Tildens, a single father and his two daughters around Becky and Darlene's ages (Wings Hauser, Mara Hobel, Danielle Harris), move in next door. Jackie dates Fisher (Matt Roth), a much younger man. When Roseanne discovers he is physically abusive, Dan confronts him and beats him up (never shown onscreen), and is arrested. Roseanne and Jackie's father dies, and Roseanne confronts his longtime secret mistress only to find her father blamed his daughters for his abuse towards them. Roseanne's rich, estranged cousin Ronnie (Joan Collins) visits and persuades Darlene to get her GED and apply to art school. David applies as well. Darlene asks her parents if David can move in, because his mother is moving away and they want to stay together. Roseanne and Dan initially refuse, but when Roseanne sees David's mother being verbally and emotionally abusive, she decides to let him stay because it reminded her of her own troubled childhood with her equally abusive father. Roger (Tim Curry) offers Dan a deal to renovate and sell a small fixer-upper house, then runs off before the deal is complete; Jackie decides to buy the house, saving Dan from financial ruin. David gets a rejection letter from art school, while Darlene gets an acceptance. At the end of the season, Roseanne fears Darlene will run away to school, although Darlene has already decided not to go. Realizing she was wrong, Roseanne persuades Darlene to not give up on her goals just to stay with David.[44] During this season, there is a running gag in which each of the Conners (save Becky) appears in a different scene in the same long-sleeved, egg-printed shirt with a large chicken on the front.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable guest stars during the season include Wings Hauser as Ty Tilden, Danielle Harris as Molly Tilden, Mara Hobel as Charlotte Tilden, Loretta Lynn as herself, Morgan Fairchild as Nancy's girlfriend Marla, Bill Maher as Bob, Ed Begley, Jr. as Principal Alexander, Blake Clark as Vic, Red Buttons as Bev's lover Jake, Sally Kirkland as Mark and David's mother Barbara, Tim Curry as Nancy's lover Roger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as DJ's annoying wannabe friend George, Joan Collins as Roseanne and Jackie's cousin Ronnie, Matt Roth as Jackie's boyfriend Fisher, Steve Jones as a threatening diner patron, and in a very brief cameo, Chris Farley as a customer trying on a too-small leather jacket.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder pressure from Roseanne to leave the Lanford Lunch Box, Bev sells her share in the restaurant to Leon to get back at them. David proposes marriage to Darlene, but she refuses. Dan and Roseanne discover an old stash of marijuana and smoke it in their bathroom. Roseanne's past as an abuse victim arises when she reacts violently to DJ after he joyrides and wrecks her car, leading her to worry she may be continuing the cycle. Becky (now played by Sarah Chalke) and Mark return home and move into the Conners' house. Mark goes to trade school but drops out. Jackie gets pregnant as a result of a one-night stand and later develops a relationship with the baby's father, Fred (Michael O'Keefe). Roseanne and Dan discover David secretly moved in with Darlene at school and throw him out, but take him back soon after. Roseanne visits a gay bar with Nancy, where she receives a surprise kiss from Nancy's girlfriend. Jackie gives birth to a son, Andy. Dan confronts his mother's history of mental illness. The season concludes with Fred and Jackie's wedding.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable guest stars during the season include Michael O'Keefe as Fred, the father of Jackie's baby; Sandra Bernhard as Nancy, Roseanne and Jackie's co-worker; Mariel Hemingway as Sharon, Nancy's girlfriend; Vicki Lawrence as Phyllis, Dan's old flame; Florence Henderson as Flo, a woman with whom Roseanne networks at a women's business club meeting; Genie Francis and Anthony Geary as General Hospital's Luke and Laura Spencer; Ahmet Zappa as Roy, Mark's handsome laconic roommate; and Fabio as himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening credits of Season 7 change from previous seasons in that the show now stars \\"Roseanne\\" instead of \\"Roseanne Arnold\\".\\r\\nOn the September 21, 1994 Season 7 premiere; In celebrating Roseanne's divorce and dropping her last name... All credits (Opening and closing) included the cast and crew's first names only. This was the only time this occurred in an episode during its run.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason seven begins with Roseanne's pregnancy and goes on to tackle such issues as abortion, alcoholism, drug abuse, sexual dysfunction, and racial prejudice. Darlene and David break up after briefly maintaining an open relationship, leading to some awkwardness for Roseanne and Dan as they try to deal living with their daughter's ex-boyfriend. David and Darlene both date other people, but eventually, they reunite. Due to tension in the household, Mark and Becky move into a trailer. DJ plays a bigger role this season, most notably in an episode wherein he refuses to kiss a black girl in his school play.[46] Episode 19 is a special 45-minute show that recounts all the previous seasons with Roseanne being \\"welcomed\\" by other sitcom moms.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable guest stars during the season include Sharon Stone as a trailer-park resident, Ellen DeGeneres as Jackie and Fred's psychologist, Danny Masterson as Darlene's boyfriend Jimmy, and Traci Lords as Lanford Lunch Box busperson Stacy. In the season finale, a tribute is made to Sherwood Schwartz. Uncredited appearances at the end of the episode have Gilligan's Island cast members playing Roseanne characters. These include Dawn Wells, Bob Denver, Tina Louise, and Russell Johnson, as well as Sherwood Schwartz. Also, Isabel Sanford, Alley Mills, Barbara Billingsley, June Lockhart, and Pat Crowley appear as themselves in another episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason eight addresses Roseanne's baby shower and the subsequent arrival of her son, Jerry Garcia Conner. (In a continuity error, the baby had been revealed to be a girl in season seven. Roseanne, in an after-credits out of character scene, explains that after she fell pregnant she wished the Conners' baby to be the same gender as hers). The season starts when Dan decides to leave the security of his city job to help build the new prison being constructed outside of Lanford. With the pension, final check, and retirement money he receives for leaving his job he decides to give his family the vacation they never had and takes everyone, including Mark, David, and Roseanne's mother, along to Walt Disney World.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is later revealed that one of the nights the clan was at Disney was also the night Darlene got pregnant. Darlene quickly decides she and David want to have the baby and the two get engaged. The season climaxes with a very rushed wedding for Darlene. Immediately after the ceremony, realizing how much has been changing, Dan suffers a heart attack. In the next episode, it is revealed that he survives, as DJ saved his life. The season concludes with Dan and Roseanne having a bitter fight after Dan refuses to stick to his diet and exercise plan, rehashing many of the buried personality clashes of the entire series. They end up wrecking their living room in the process. The credits fade as Roseanne walks out on Dan. Other subjects are DJ's Thanksgiving pageant, Darlene's wedding, and Dan's heart attack.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable guest stars during the season include Fred Willard as Leon's husband Scott, Ed McMahon as himself, John Popper (with Blues Traveler) as an old friend of Dan's, Pat Harrington Jr. as himself, Jenna Elfman as hitchhiker Garland, Shecky Greene as Bar Mitzvah guest Uncle Saul, Norm Crosby as Reverend Crosley, June Lockhart as Leon's mother, the cast of Stomp as Lanford Lunch Box patrons, Eric Dane as a Disney World bellhop, and Tony Curtis as ballroom-dance instructor Hal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening titles of Season 9 still say the show stars \\"Roseanne\\", but the first episode credits her as \\"Roseanne Barr Pentland Arnold Thomas\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ninth season features many changes. In previous seasons, the original theme song was played on saxophone, accompanied by drums and other instruments. For this final season, the theme was re-recorded and performed by Blues Traveler with a distorted harmonicaone of the band's staplesplaying in place of the saxophone. Lyrics were also added and sung into the theme by the band's lead vocalist, John Popper. Episodes in this season exhibit a much more surreal style. Additionally, the 'daily struggle' theme of previous episodes is abandoned, and the season focuses primarily on bringing the characters full circle emotionally.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conners win the state lottery jackpot of $108 million; Dan ponders the meaning of life, Jackie meets her prince, DJ finds love, and Darlene, after some trouble, gives birth. John Goodman is absent for most of the season, as he was busy filming The Big Lebowski; in later episodes, Goodman resembles his \\"Lebowski\\" character Walter Sobchak.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the season's final episode, Roseanne reveals the entire series itself is actually a story written by Roseanne Conner about her life. To cope, Roseanne twisted major elements of her life for the story, which the audience does not discover until the final moments of the season. In reality, Dan's heart attack near the end of Season 8 was fatal and the Conner family did not win the lottery. A story arc running through the final season, that Dan betrayed Roseanne by having an affair, is revealed to be false. We learn that Dan's betrayal wasn't having an affair, but dying.\\r\\n\\r\\nTough Roseanne, who could always take the worst life could throw at her with a laugh, could not handle Dan's death. Also, Jackie is a lesbian and Beverly is straight. Scott is a probate lawyer whom Roseanne befriended, and set up with Leonwho she claims isn't very hip the way she had written him to be; this seems a tad tongue in cheek.[48] Becky is dating David and Darlene is with Mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuest stars during the season include Edward Asner as Lou Grant, Heather Matarazzo as D.J.s girlfriend, Dann Florek as Doctor Rudmen, Jim Varney as Jackie's boyfriend Prince Carlos, Tammy Faye Bakker as Roseanne's makeup consultant, Dina Merrill as Doris, Joanna Lumley as Patsy Stone and Jennifer Saunders as Edina Monsoon (reprising their roles from Absolutely Fabulous), Arianna Huffington as Estree, Marlo Thomas as Tina, James Brolin as Roseanne's business partner/love interest Edgar Wellman, Jr., and Ann Wedgeworth and Debbie Reynolds as Dan's mother Audrey, as well as Hugh Hefner, Milton Berle, Robin Leach, Todd Oldham, Moon Unit and Ahmet Zappa, Tony Robbins, Kathleen Sullivan, Steven Seagal, and Jerry Springer as themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the show's final season, Barr was in negotiations with Carsey-Werner Productions and ABC executives to continue playing Roseanne Conner in a spin-off.[49] However, ABC withdrew from negotiations with Carsey-Werner and Barr after failed discussions with CBS and Fox. Barr and Carsey-Werner agreed to discontinue the negotiations.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 2008, Barr commented on what the current whereabouts of the Conners would be. \\"I've always said now that if they were on TV, DJ would have been killed in Iraq and [the Conners] would have lost their house\\". When asked for more details on where the rest of the Conners (Dan, Jackie, Becky, Darlene, David, and Mark) would be, Barr responded: \\"Your question is intellectual property that may be developed later, so I don't want to get into that\\". She added, \\"No preview, absolutely not\\".[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 20, 2009, Barr posted an entry on her website regarding what a possible Roseanne reunion would be like, which includes: DJ being published, Mark dying in Iraq; David leaving Darlene for a woman half his age, Darlene coming out of the closet and meeting a woman and having a test tube baby with her, Becky working at Walmart, Roseanne and Jackie opening the first medical marijuana dispensary in Lanford, Arnie becoming the best friend of the Governor of Illinois and remarrying Nancy, Bev selling a painting for $10,000, Jerry and the grandsons forming a music group similar to the Jonas Brothers, Dan reappearing alive after faking his death, and Bonnie being arrested for selling crack.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 28, 2017, television trade publications reported an 8-episode revival of the series, being shopped to multiple networks including ABC and Netflix.[53][54] Barr, Goodman, and Gilbert were attached to reprise their roles, while Metcalf was considered likely to return.[53][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nBarr, Tom Werner, Bruce Helford would produce the series, alongside Gilbert, who would serve as an executive producer while Helford and Whitney Cummings would be handling day-to-day oversight of the show.[56][55] Original writer Norm Macdonald stated he had written for eight of the episodes.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2017, it was announced the series was greenlit and would air on ABC midÿseason in 2018.[58] Metcalf, Fishman, Goranson, and Chalke were all announced to return. Chalke, who played the character Becky in later seasons, was cast as Andrea, a married woman who hires Becky to be her surrogate.[59] Glenn Quinn, who played Becky's husband, Mark, died in December 2002 of a heroin overdose at the age of 32.[60] On December 1, 2017, it was announced that Johnny Galecki would be reprising his role of David Healy for one episode.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction of nine new episodes began in the fall of 2017 and wrapped in mid-December. The revival features the original cast from the previous nine seasons. New characters include David and Darlene's two children as well as D.J.'s daughter. Sarah Chalke also appears as a new character, Andrea. The sets of the Conner house were replicated at the same studio where the show was filmed for its original run. Season 10 was scheduled as a mid-season replacement to premiere on March 27, 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 21, 2017, it was revealed that Emma Kenney would be portraying Harris Conner Healy, Darlene's eldest child who was born in Season 9.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 7, 2017, it was confirmed that Estelle Parsons and Sandra Bernhard would return to the series. Parsons would appear in two episodes while Bernhard would appear in one.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 25, 2018, it was revealed on the show's official Twitter account that the trailer for the revival season would premiere during the 90th Academy Awards on March 4, 2018.[64] To promote the show, ABC sponsored the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Auto Club Speedway by naming it the Roseanne 300.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 26, 2018, Sara Gilbert revealed on Good Morning America that her sketch with John Goodman on The Talk (which Gilbert created and co-hosts) as their Roseanne characters, and Goodman's willingness to do a reboot, inspired Gilbert to reach out to her cast mates to revive the show.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 28, 2018, Roseanne Barr echoed Gilbert's statements on The Wendy Williams Show and also confirmed that Gilbert's sketch on The Talk went viral on the internet citing a demand for a reboot.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoseanne's tenth season premiered on March 27, 2018, with two back-to-back episodes on ABC. The premiere begins 20 years after the previous episode, with Season 9 and the final episode being almost completely retconned out of existence as both a dream of and a story by Roseanne; namely Dan's death, when he is actually alive. A now separated and unemployed Darlene moves back into the Conner household with her two children Harris (whose existence is the only surviving element from Season 9, although the character is several years younger) and Mark (whose gender presentation is cause for conflict).\\r\\n\\r\\nRoseanne and Dan have lost weight but are now on medication. DJ has served a tour in the Army and now has a daughter named Mary (with DJ's wife still serving abroad) and Jerry is away in Alaska on a fishing boat. When the first episode begins, Roseanne and Jackie haven't spoken since the 2016 presidential election (Roseanne having voted for Donald Trump while Jackie voted for Jill Stein despite her having no idea who Stein was, describing her as \\"some doctor\\"), although the two are reconciled after intervention by Darlene. Meanwhile, desperate for money, Becky, who has been struggling to make ends meet after the death of her husband Mark, agrees to act as a surrogate mother for a woman named Andrea (Sarah Chalke) which is opposed by Roseanne and Dan since Becky's eggs will be used for the pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, season 10 holds an approval rating of 75% based on 68 reviews, with an average rating of 6.74/10. The website consensus reads: \\"Roseanne's return finds the show's classic format, original cast, and timely humor intact, even if the latest batch of episodes suffers from sporadically uneven execution.\\"[68] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 69 out of 100 based on 31 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\"[69] Actor Tom Arnold reviewed the revival positively, specifically praising Metcalf's performance.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. president Donald Trump, whom Roseanne Barr has publicly supported, phoned to congratulate her on the success of the premiere. Barr described the call as being \\"pretty exciting\\", stating in an interview on Good Morning America that Trump \\"really knows ratings and how they measure things\\". She commented that the show would continue to address current U.S. issues, hoping that it would \\"[open] up civil conversation between people instead of just mudslinging.\\"[71][72]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 30, 2018, Roseanne was renewed for an eleventh season of 13 episodes, following the success of the revival's premiere night.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 29, 2018, Barr posted a message on Twitter reading \\"muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.\\" The tweet referred to Valerie Jarrett, an Iranian-born African-American who served as Senior Advisor to former U.S. president Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017. The \\"ape\\" tweet was widely criticized as racist. Series executive producer/showrunner Bruce Helford said he was \\"personally horrified and saddened\\" by Barr's remarks, and show co-star/executive producer Sara Gilbert called them \\"abhorrent\\" and \\"[not reflective of] the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show\\".[74][75][76]\\r\\n\\r\\nBarr's behavior on Twitter had been considered a concern among ABC executives during the lead-up to the revival's premiere, as she had a history of posting support for conspiracy theories such as QAnon and Pizzagate, along with other content that would appeal to supporters of Donald Trump.[10][77][78][79] The Jarrett posting was the culmination of several controversial tweets she had made that same morning, involving conspiracy theories about George Soros, including the factually inaccurate claim that Chelsea Clinton's husband, Marc Mezvinsky, is a nephew of Soros, and that Soros wanted to \\"[overthrow the] U.S. constitutional republic\\" by backing district attorney candidates that would \\"ignore US law & favor 'feelings' instead-and call everyone who is alarmed by that 'racist'\\", and claiming Soros had been a Nazi in his youth.[80] Barr's ex-husband and original series recurring cast member Tom Arnold claimed he had notified ABC of Barr's frequent controversial tweets similar to those she had made during the morning of May 29 that led to the network reversing its decision to renew the show.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wake of the posting, consulting producer/writer Wanda Sykes announced that she would no longer be involved with the program.[81] Barr defended the tweet as being a \\"joke\\", and stated in a subsequent post, \\"ISLAM is not a RACE, lefties. Islam includes EVERY RACE of people\\". Barr later deleted the \\"ape\\" tweet and posted an apology, stating that she was \\"truly sorry for making a bad joke about [Jarrett's] politics and her looks.\\"[8][10][80]\\r\\n\\r\\nABC announced later in the day that it had reversed the renewal decision and canceled Roseanne; network president Channing Dungey stated that Barr's remarks were \\"abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.\\"[82][83] ABC pulled a rerun that was scheduled to air that night, replacing it with an episode of The Middle (which had ended its series run the week prior, and which ABC had already scheduled a rerun to air immediately following Roseanne that evening), and suspended its campaign for the series to be considered for nomination at the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nHulu announced it would remove all episodes of the original and revival series from its library; Viacom-owned cable channels Paramount Network, TV Land and CMT dropped the series from their lineups effective the following day, while digital multicast network Laff pulled reruns from its schedule effective immediately.[85][80][86][87] In a tweet (which she later deleted), co-star Emma Kenney revealed she was contacting her agent asking to quit the revival when she heard about the show's cancellation, remarking that she felt \\"empowered by [Sykes, Dungey and ABC for] standing up against abuse of power and lack of values. Bullies do not win. Ever.\\"[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remarks also sparked a divide among conservatives who made up a substantial segment of the revival's viewer base. Many deemed the cancellation an act of political correctness and an infringement of Barr's rights to freedom of speech, while others (including Rick Wilson, Bret Baier, Tomi Lahren and Sean Hannity) condemned the remarks with some pointing out that none of her First Amendment rights were violated.[88][89][90][91][92][93] ABC had heavily emphasized the success of Roseanne during its upfront presentations for the 2018ÿ19 television season, leading to questions over possible repercussions for the network due to the loss of potential advertising revenue, and its plans for what would have been Roseanne's time slot on the fall schedule.[94][95]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly before the cancellation was announced by ABC, Barr ÿ who attributed the tweet about Jarrett and others made earlier that day to side effects from the sleep aid Ambien, a claim derided by many critics as well as by the drug's manufacturer, Sanofi, in a public statement responding to Barr's reasoning[96] ÿ apologized for the remarks, saying, \\"I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me ÿ my joke was in bad taste.\\" Hours after the cancellation announcement, BuzzFeed later released a longer apology to Jarrett, the network and her show's cast and crew: \\"I deeply regret my comments from late last night on Twitter. Above all, I want to apologize to Valerie Jarrett, as well as to ABC and the cast and crew of the Roseanne show. I am sorry for making a thoughtless joke that does not reflect my values  I love all people and am very sorry. Today my words caused hundreds of hardworking people to lose their jobs. I also sincerely apologize to the audience that has embraced my work for decades. I apologize from the bottom of my heart and hope that you can find it in your hearts to forgive me.\\" However, she would later retweet posts defending her, as well as another concerning the conspiracy theory of Soros being a Nazi collaborator.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time after the cancellation was confirmed, some news sources announced that the show could possibly be re-tooled as a spin-off focusing on Sara Gilbert's character of Darlene.[97][98]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround June 15, 2018 reports emerged that ABC was close to making a deal to indeed continue the show as a Darlene-centric show,[99][100] though it is also possible that it will be entitled The Conners, and would center around the whole family.[101] The spin-off will only go forward assuming Barr signs a deal to give up rights to the show, meaning she wont be involved creatively or financially. Barr will likely receive a one-time payment in return.[102] If the spin-off happens, it has been stated that Barr's racism scandal will be addressed on the show.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 21, 2018, it was announced that ABC had officially ordered a 10-episode spin-off tentatively titled The Conners, and that it would involve every original cast member except Barr. Emma Kenney, Ames McNamara, Jayden Rey and recurring characters have not been confirmed as of yet.[104] The series is set to premiere on October 16, 2018.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoseanne was successful from its beginning, ranking #1 in the Nielsen ratings during its second season (1989-90), narrowly beating out The Cosby Show.[106][107][108]  Each of the series' first six seasons landed in the Nielsen ratings' top five.  Ratings slowly started slipping after season six, though the show stayed within the top 10 through season seven, falling to the top 20 during season eight.  Roseanne dropped to 35th place during the ninth and final season of its original run.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe premiere of the revival (season 10) set records for Nielsen's delayed viewing metrics; it was seen by 18.45 million live and same day viewers, but gained an additional 6.59 viewers via Live+3 metricsthe largest-ever increase in total viewership from three days of delayed viewing since the 2014 premiere of fellow ABC series How to Get Away with Murder. 2.2 million additional viewers were added over the following four days (totaling 27.26 million viewers overall), resulting in a net increase of 8.81 million viewers in the week since the premiere broadcast. This established a record for the largest ratings gain from Live+7 viewership, previously set by the premiere of fellow ABC series The Good Doctor in September 2017.[109][110][111][112]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoseanne was put into off-network syndication beginning in September 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\nTBS aired reruns of Roseanne from 1996 through 2004. Cable channel Nick at Nite aired reruns of the show from the fall of 2003 until 2009; it has since moved to TV Land's \\"TV Land Prime\\" schedule. Oxygen aired reruns for several years under the ownership of Carsey-Werner before its 2007 acquisition by NBCUniversal. The show returned to Nick at Nite's lineup on October 5, 2009, replacing Family Matters and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in its late-night timeslot. As of January 2010, Nick at Nite has once again taken Roseanne from its time slot. In Australia, the show is seen on the channel 111 Hits and Eleven. In the UK, it aired in reruns on Channel 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nWE tv and CMT both began airing the series in September 2012.[140][141] The show also was carried by Nick at Nite/CMT sister network Logo TV, and over-the-air on Laff.\\r\\n\\r\\nViacom pulled the series from its networks in May 2018, concurrently with ABC's cancellation, along with Laff.[85][142]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, Roseanne Barr and Laurie Metcalf both won Emmy Awards for their performances in the series, Barr for Outstanding Lead Actress and Metcalf for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Metcalf also won in 1992 and 1994.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, Roseanne Barr and John Goodman both won Golden Globe Awards, Barr for Best Actress and Goodman for Best Actor. The series won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series ÿ Musical or Comedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series won a Peabody Award in 1992 and a People's Choice Award for Favorite New Television Comedy Program in 1989. Barr won five additional People's Choice Awards for Favorite Female Performer in a New TV Program (1989), Favorite Female All Around Entertainer (1990), and Favorite Female TV Performer (1990, 1994, and 1995).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, the entire cast (except for Metcalf) reunited at the TV Land Awards to receive the Innovator Award. In their acceptance speech, they honored late cast member Glenn Quinn.[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show also received several nominations in Editing, Art Direction, Music, Lighting Direction, Writing and Hairstyling.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnchor Bay Entertainment (quietly named Starz Home Entertainment resulting in some DVD packaging bearing this name) released all nine seasons on DVD in Region 1 (2005ÿ2007) and Region 2. The first season was issued with shorter, syndicated versions of the episodes because Anchor Bay was unable to obtain permission to release the original broadcasts. In the company's eighth and ninth season DVDs, some scenes have been altered to avoid disputes over music rights, including substituting some closing credit scenes with a black screen, including the Patty Duke parody from Season 8, Episode 1. As of 2010, the Region 1 releases have been discontinued and are out of print.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 4, 2011, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that they had acquired the rights to re-release the series uncut on DVD in Region 1. They have subsequently re-released all nine seasons and a complete series set with the first seven seasons in their uncut form.[144][145][146][147][148] Seasons 8 and 9 are still edited; while most of the music references were retained, some of the credit scenes are still missing.[149][150]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Germany, Universum Film has released the entire series on DVD, and released a complete series box set on July 3, 2009.[151] Unlike the Anchor Bay releases, these were mostly unedited. Footage from Some Like It Hot is excluded from an eighth season episode, for unknown reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia and New Zealand, Magna Pacific has released all nine seasons on DVD in Region 4. Unlike the Anchor Bay releases, Magna Pacific's first season DVDs include the full-length original broadcast episodes.","field3":"When did the first episode of roseanne air?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"White blood cells (WBCs), also called leukocytes or leucocytes, are the cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. All white blood cells are produced and derived from multipotent cells in the bone marrow known as hematopoietic stem cells. Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic system.[1]\\r\\nAll white blood cells have nuclei, which distinguishes them from the other blood cells, the anucleated red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets. Types of white blood cells can be classified in standard ways. Two pairs of broadest categories classify them either by structure (granulocytes or agranulocytes) or by cell division lineage (myeloid cells or lymphoid cells). These broadest categories can be further divided into the five main types: neutrophils, eosinophils(acidophilus), basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes.[2] These types are distinguished by their physical and functional characteristics. Monocytes and neutrophils are phagocytic. Further subtypes can be classified; for example, among lymphocytes, there are B cells, T cells, and NK cells.\\r\\nThe number of leukocytes in the blood is often an indicator of disease, and thus the WBC count is an important subset of the complete blood count. The normal white cell count is usually between 4 G 109/L and 11 G 109/L. In the US this is usually expressed as 4,000 to 11,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood.[3] They make up approximately 1% of the total blood volume in a healthy adult,[4] making them substantially less numerous than the RBCs at 40% to 45%. However, this 1% of the blood makes a large difference to health, because immunity depends on it. An increase in the number of leukocytes over the upper limits is called leukocytosis. It is normal when it is part of healthy immune responses, which happen frequently. It is occasionally abnormal, when it is neoplastic or autoimmune in origin. A decrease below the lower limit is called leukopenia. This indicates a weakened immune system.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"white blood cell\\" derives from the physical appearance of a blood sample after centrifugation. White cells are found in the buff, a thin, typically white layer of nucleated cells between the sedimented red blood cells and the blood plasma. The scientific term leukocyte directly reflects its description. It is derived from the Greek roots leuk- meaning \\"white\\" and cyt- meaning \\"cell\\". The buffy coat may sometimes be green if there are large amounts of neutrophils in the sample, due to the heme-containing enzyme myeloperoxidase that they produce.\\r\\nAll white blood cells are nucleated, which distinguishes them from the anucleated red blood cells and platelets.

Further subtypes can be classified.\\r\\nGranulocytes are distinguished from agranulocytes by their nucleus shape (lobed versus round, that is, polymorphonuclear versus mononuclear) and by their cytoplasm granules (present or absent, or more precisely, visible on light microscopy or not thus visible). The other dichotomy is by lineage: Myeloid cells (neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils) are distinguished from lymphoid cells (lymphocytes) by hematopoietic lineage (cellular differentiation lineage).[6] Lymphocytes can be further classified as T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells.\\r\\nNeutrophils are the most abundant white blood cell, constituting 60-70% of the circulating leukocytes.[4] They defend against bacterial or fungal infection. They are usually first responders to microbial infection; their activity and death in large numbers form pus. They are commonly referred to as polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, although, in the technical sense, PMN refers to all granulocytes. They have a multi-lobed nucleus, which consists of three to five lobes connected by slender strands.[9] This gives the neutrophils the appearance of having multiple nuclei, hence the name polymorphonuclear leukocyte. The cytoplasm may look transparent because of fine granules that are pale lilac when stained. Neutrophils are active in phagocytosing bacteria and are present in large amount in the pus of wounds. These cells are not able to renew their lysosomes (used in digesting microbes) and die after having phagocytosed a few pathogens.[10] Neutrophils are the most common cell type seen in the early stages of acute inflammation. The life span of a circulating human neutrophil is about 5.4 days.[11]\\r\\nEosinophils compose about 2-4% of the WBC total. This count fluctuates throughout the day, seasonally, and during menstruation. It rises in response to allergies, parasitic infections, collagen diseases, and disease of the spleen and central nervous system. They are rare in the blood, but numerous in the mucous membranes of the respiratory, digestive, and lower urinary tracts.[9]\\r\\nThey primarily deal with parasitic infections. Eosinophils are also the predominant inflammatory cells in allergic reactions. The most important causes of eosinophilia include allergies such as asthma, hay fever, and hives; and also parasitic infections. They secrete chemicals that destroy these large parasites, such as hook worms and tapeworms, that are too big for any one WBC to phagocytize. In general, their nucleus is bi-lobed. The lobes are connected by a thin strand.[9] The cytoplasm is full of granules that assume a characteristic pink-orange color with eosin staining.\\r\\nBasophils are chiefly responsible for allergic and antigen response by releasing the chemical histamine causing the dilation of blood vessels. Because they are the rarest of the white blood cells (less than 0.5% of the total count) and share physicochemical properties with other blood cells, they are difficult to study.[12] They can be recognized by several coarse, dark violet granules, giving them a blue hue. The nucleus is bi- or tri-lobed, but it is hard to see because of the number of coarse granules that hide it.\\r\\nThey excrete two chemicals that aid in the body's defenses: histamine and heparin. Histamine is responsible for widening blood vessels and increasing the flow of blood to injured tissue. It also makes blood vessels more permeable so neutrophils and clotting proteins can get into connective tissue more easily. Heparin is an anticoagulant that inhibits blood clotting and promotes the movement of white blood cells into an area. Basophils can also release chemical signals that attract eosinophils and neutrophils to an infection site.[9]\\r\\nLymphocytes are much more common in the lymphatic system than in blood. Lymphocytes are distinguished by having a deeply staining nucleus that may be eccentric in location, and a relatively small amount of cytoplasm. Lymphocytes include:\\r\\nMonocytes, the largest type of WBCs, share the \\"vacuum cleaner\\" (phagocytosis) function of neutrophils, but are much longer lived as they have an extra role: they present pieces of pathogens to T cells so that the pathogens may be recognized again and killed. This causes an antibody response to be mounted. Monocytes eventually leave the bloodstream and become tissue macrophages, which remove dead cell debris as well as attack microorganisms. Neither dead cell debris nor attacking microorganisms can be dealt with effectively by the neutrophils. Unlike neutrophils, monocytes are able to replace their lysosomal contents and are thought to have a much longer active life. They have the kidney shaped nucleus and are typically agranulated. They also possess abundant cytoplasm.\\r\\nSome leucocytes migrate into the tissues of the body to take up a permanent residence at that location rather than remaining in the blood. Often these cells have specific names depending upon which tissue they settle in, such as fixed macrophages in the liver, which become known as Kupffer cells. These cells still serve a role in the immune system.\\r\\nThe two commonly used categories of white blood cell disorders divide them quantitatively into those causing excessive numbers (proliferative disorders) and those causing insufficient numbers (leukopenias).[13] Leukocytosis is usually healthy (e.g., fighting an infection), but it also may be dysfunctionally proliferative. WBC proliferative disorders can be classed as myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative. Some are autoimmune, but many are neoplastic.\\r\\nAnother way to categorize disorders of white blood cells is qualitatively. There are various disorders in which the number of white blood cells is normal but the cells do not function normally.[14]\\r\\nNeoplasia of WBCs can be benign but is often malignant. Of the various tumors of the blood and lymph, cancers of WBCs can be broadly classified as leukemias and lymphomas, although those categories overlap and are often grouped as a pair.\\r\\nA range of disorders can cause decreases in white blood cells. This type of white blood cell decreased is usually the neutrophil. In this case the decrease may be called neutropenia or granulocytopenia. Less commonly, a decrease in lymphocytes (called lymphocytopenia or lymphopenia) may be seen.[13]\\r\\nNeutropenia can be acquired or intrinsic.[15] A decrease in levels of neutrophils on lab tests is due to either decreased production of neutrophils or increased removal from the blood.[13] The following list of causes is not complete.\\r\\nSymptoms of neutropenia are associated with the underlying cause of the decrease in neutrophils. For example, the most common cause of acquired neutropenia is drug-induced, so an individual may have symptoms of medication overdose or toxicity. Treatment is also aimed at the underlying cause of the neutropenia.[16] One severe consequence of neutropenia is that it can increase the risk of infection.[14]\\r\\nDefined as total lymphocyte count below 1.0x109/L, the cells most commonly affected are CD4+ T cells. Like neutropenia, lymphocytopenia may be acquired or intrinsic and there are many causes.[14] This is not a complete list.\\r\\nLike neutropenia, symptoms and treatment of lymphocytopenia are directed at the underlying cause of the change in cell counts.\\r\\nAn increase in the number of white blood cells in circulation is called leukocytosis.[13] This increase is most commonly caused by inflammation.[13] There are four major causes: increase of production in bone marrow, increased release from storage in bone marrow, decreased attachment to veins and arteries, decreased uptake by tissues.[13] Leukocytosis may affect one or more cell lines and can be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, basophilic, monocytosis, or lymphocytosis.\\r\\nNeutrophilia is an increase in the absolute neutrophil count in the peripheral circulation. Normal blood values vary by age.[14] Neutrophilia can be caused by a direct problem with blood cells (primary disease). It can also occur as a consequence of an underlying disease (secondary). Most cases of neutrophilia are secondary to inflammation.[16]\\r\\nPrimary causes[16]\\r\\nSecondary causes[16]\\r\\nA normal eosinophil count is considered to be less than 0.65G109/L.[14] Eosinophil counts are higher in newborns and vary with age, time (lower in the morning and higher at night), exercise, environment, and exposure to allergens.[14] Eosinophilia is never a normal lab finding. Efforts should always be made to discover the underlying cause, though the cause may not always be found.[14]\\r\\nThe complete blood cell count is a blood panel that includes the overall WBC count and various subsets such as the absolute neutrophil count. Reference ranges for blood tests specify the typical counts in healthy people.\\r\\nTLC- (Total leucocyte count): Normal TLC in an adult person is 6000-8000WBC/mm^3 of blood.\\r\\nDLC- (Differential leucocyte count): Number/ (%) of different type of leucocyte in per cubic mm. of blood.","field3":"What is the primary function of white blood cells?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"a proprietary teaching device and method introduced in 1995 as a digital replacement for aging chart recorders and oscilloscopes that were widely used in undergraduate teaching laboratories prior to that time","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The Biopac Student Lab is a proprietary teaching device and method introduced in 1995 as a digital replacement for aging chart recorders and oscilloscopes that were widely used in undergraduate teaching laboratories prior to that time. It is manufactured by BIOPAC Systems, Inc., of Goleta, California.[1] The advent of low cost personal computers meant that older analog technologies could be replaced with powerful and less expensive computerized alternatives.[2]\\r\\nStudents in undergraduate teaching labs use the BSL system to record data from their own bodies, animals or tissue preparations. The BSL system integrates hardware, software and curriculum materials including over sixty experiments that students use to study the cardiovascular system, muscles, pulmonary function, autonomic nervous system, and the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the more complicated concepts for students to grasp is the fact that electricity is flowing throughout a living body at all times and that it is possible to use the signals to measure the performance and health of individual parts of the body. The Biopac Student Lab System helps to explain the concept and allows students to understand physiology.[3]\\r\\nPhysiology and electricity share a common history, with some of the pioneering work in each field being done in the late 18th century by Count Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta and Luigi Galvani. Count Volta invented the battery and had a unit of electrical measurement named in his honor (the Volt). These early researchers studied \\"animal electricity\\" and were among the first to realize that applying an electrical signal to an isolated animal muscle caused it to twitch. The Biopac Student Lab uses procedures similar to Count Voltas to demonstrate how muscles can be electrically stimulated.\\r\\nThe BSL system includes data acquisition hardware with built-in universal amplifiers to record and condition electrical signals from the heart, muscle, nerve, brain, eye, respiratory system, and tissue preparations.[4] The data acquisition system receives the signals from electrodes and transducers. The electrical signals are extremely smallwith amplitudes sometimes in the microVolt (1/1,000,000 of a volt) rangeso the hardware amplifies these signals, filters out unwanted electrical noise or interfering signals, and converts them to a set of numbers that the computer can read. Biopac Student Lab software then displays the numbers as waveforms on the monitor.\\r\\nThe data acquisition system connects to a PC running Windows or Macintosh operating systems, via USB. The electrodes and transducers employ sensors that allow the software to communicate with the students to ensure that they are using the correct devices and collecting good data. Software guides students by using onscreen instructions and a detailed lab manual follows the scientific method. Once students have collected data, they use analysis tools to measure the amplitude and frequency, plus a wide range of other values from the electrical signals.[5] The analysis process allows students to make general comparisons with the data. They can compare their results to published normal values, or the values before and after a subject performed a specified task. They can also compare results with other students in the lab. The software is available in English, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Chinese.\\r\\nThe Biopac Student Lab System is widely used by undergraduate labs to teach physiology, pharmacology, biology, neuroscience, psychology, psychophysiology, exercise physiology, and biomedical engineering. Publishers have adopted the curriculum materials and included them in commercially available lab manuals.","field3":"What is biopac and what does it do?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"The 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"American Civil War\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry was an infantry regiment that saw extensive service in the Union Army during the American Civil War. The unit was the first African-American regiment organized in the northern states during the Civil War.[1][2] Authorized by the Emancipation Proclamation, the regiment consisted of African-American enlisted men commanded by white officers.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unit began recruiting in February 1863 and trained at Camp Meigs outside Boston, Massachusetts.[3] Prominent abolitionists were active in recruitment efforts, including Frederick Douglass, whose two sons were among the first to enlist.[4] Massachusetts Governor John Albion Andrew, who had long pressured the U.S. Department of War to begin recruiting African-Americans, placed a high priority on the formation of the 54th Massachusetts.[5] Andrew appointed Robert Gould Shaw, the son of Boston abolitionists, to command the regiment as Colonel. The free black community in Boston was also instrumental in recruiting efforts, utilizing networks reaching beyond Massachusetts and even into the southern states to attract soldiers and fill out the ranks.[6] After its departure from Massachusetts on May 28, 1863, the 54th Massachusetts was shipped to Beaufort, South Carolina and became part of the X Corps commanded by Major General David Hunter.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its service with the X Corps, the 54th Massachusetts took part in operations against Charleston, South Carolina, including the Battle of Grimball's Landing on July 16, 1863, and the more famous Second Battle of Fort Wagner on July 18, 1863. During the latter engagement, the 54th Massachusetts, with other Union regiments, executed a frontal assault against Fort Wagner and suffered casualties of 20 killed, 125 wounded, and 102 missing (primarily presumed dead)--roughly 40 percent of the unit's numbers at that time.[8][9] Col. Robert G. Shaw was killed on the parapet of Fort Wagner.[8] In 1864, as part of the Union Army's Department of Florida, the 54th Massachusetts took part in the Battle of Olustee.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe service of the 54th Massachusetts, particularly their charge at Fort Wagner, soon became one of the most famous episodes of the war, interpreted through artwork, poetry and song.[10] More recently, the 54th Massachusetts gained prominence in popular culture through the award-winning film Glory.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral recruitment of African Americans for service in the Union Army was authorized by the Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Lincoln on January 1, 1863. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton accordingly instructed the Governor of Massachusetts, John A. Andrew, to begin raising regiments including \\"persons of African descent\\" on January 26, 1863.[12] Andrew selected Robert Gould Shaw to be the regiment's colonel and Norwood Penrose \\"Pen\\" Hallowell to be its lieutenant colonel.[13] Like many officers of regiments of African-American troops, both Robert Gould Shaw and Hallowell were promoted several grades, both being captains at the time.[13] The rest of the officers were evaluated by Shaw and Hallowell:  these officers included Luis Emilio,[14] and Garth Wilkinson \\"Wilkie\\" James, brother of Henry James and William James.  Many of these officers were of abolitionist families and several were chosen by Governor Andrew himself. Lt. Col. Norwood Hallowell was joined by his younger brother Edward Needles Hallowell who commanded the 54th as a full colonel for the rest of the war after Shaw's death. Twenty-four of the 29 officers were veterans, but only six had been previously commissioned.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldiers were recruited by white abolitionists (including Shaw's parents). These recruiters included Lieutenant J. Appleton,[16] also the first man commissioned in the regiment, whose recruiting efforts included posting a notice in the Boston Journal.[17] Wendell Phillips and Edward L. Pierce spoke at a Joy Street Church recruiting rally, encouraging free blacks to enlist.[citation needed] About 100 people were actively involved in recruitment, including those from Joy Street Church and a group of individuals appointed by Governor Andrew to enlist black men for the 54th.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 54th trained at Camp Meigs in Readville near Boston. While there they received considerable moral support from abolitionists in Massachusetts, including Ralph Waldo Emerson.[19] Material support included warm clothing items, battle flags and $500 contributed for the equipping and training of a regimental band. As it became evident that many more recruits were coming forward than were needed, the medical exam for the 54th was described as \\"rigid and thorough\\" by the Massachusetts Surgeon-General. This resulted in what he described as \\"a more robust, strong and healthy set of men were never mustered into the service of the United States.\\"[20] Despite this, as was common in the Civil War, a few men died of disease prior to the 54th's departure from Camp Meigs.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy most accounts the 54th left Boston with very high morale. This was despite the fact that Jefferson Davis's proclamation of December 23, 1862,[21] effectively put both African-American enlisted men and white officers under a death sentence if captured. The proclamation was affirmed by the Confederate Congress in January 1863 and turned both enlisted soldiers and their white officers over to the states from which the enlisted soldiers had been slaves. As most Southern states had enacted draconian measures for \\"servile insurrection\\" after Nat Turner's Rebellion, the likely sentence was a capital one.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter muster into federal service on May 13, 1863,[22] the 54th left Boston with fanfare on May 28, and arrived to more celebrations in Beaufort, South Carolina. They were greeted by local blacks and by Northern abolitionists, some of whom had deployed from Boston a year earlier as missionaries to the Port Royal Experiment.[23] In Beaufort, they joined with the 2nd South Carolina Volunteers, a unit of South Carolina freedmen led by James Montgomery.[24] After the 2nd Volunteers' successful Raid at Combahee Ferry, Montgomery led both units in a raid on the town of Darien, Georgia.[25] The population had fled, and Montgomery ordered the soldiers to loot and burn the empty town.[26] Shaw objected to this activity and complained over Montgomery's head that burning and looting were not suitable activities for his model regiment.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regiment's first battlefield action took place in a skirmish with Confederate troops on James Island, South Carolina, on July 16. The regiment stopped a Confederate assault,[28] losing 42 men in the process.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regiment gained recognition on July 18, 1863, when it spearheaded an assault on Fort Wagner near Charleston, South Carolina. 270 of the 600 men who charged Fort Wagner were \\"killed, wounded or captured.\\"[29] At this battle Colonel Shaw was killed, along with 29 of his men; 24 more later died of wounds, 15 were captured, 52 were missing in action and never accounted for, and 149 were wounded. The total regimental casualties of 270 would be the highest total for the 54th in a single engagement during the war. Although Union forces were not able to take and hold the fort (despite taking a portion of the walls in the initial assault), the 54th was widely acclaimed for its valor during the battle, and the event helped encourage the further enlistment and mobilization of African-American troops, a key development that President Abraham Lincoln once noted as helping to secure the final victory. Decades later, Sergeant William Harvey Carney was awarded the Medal of Honor for grabbing the U.S. flag as the flag bearer fell, carrying the flag to the enemy ramparts and back, and singing \\"Boys, the old flag never touched the ground!\\" While other African Americans had since been granted the award by the time it was presented to Carney, Carney's is the earliest action for which the Medal of Honor was awarded to an African American.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the command of now-Colonel Edward Hallowell, the 54th fought a rear-guard action covering the Union retreat at the Battle of Olustee. During the retreat, the unit was suddenly ordered to counter-march back to Ten-Mile station.  The locomotive of a train carrying wounded Union soldiers had broken down and the wounded were in danger of capture. When the 54th arrived, the men attached ropes to the engine and cars and manually pulled the train approximately three miles (4.8?km) to Camp Finnegan, where horses were secured to help pull the train. After that, the train was pulled by both men and horses to Jacksonville for a total distance of ten miles (16?km). It took forty-two hours to pull the train that distance.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of an all-black brigade under Col. Alfred S. Hartwell, they unsuccessfully attacked entrenched Confederate militia at the November 1864 Battle of Honey Hill. In mid-April 1865, they fought at the Battle of Boykin's Mill, a small affair in South Carolina that proved to be one of the last engagements of the war.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enlisted men of the 54th were recruited on the promise of pay and allowances equal to their white counterparts. This was supposed to amount to subsistence and $13 a month.[30] Instead, they were informed upon arriving in South Carolina, the Department of the South would pay them only $7 per month ($10 with $3 withheld for clothing, while white soldiers did not pay for clothing at all.)[31] Colonel Shaw and many others immediately began protesting the measure.[32] Although the state of Massachusetts offered to make up the difference in pay, on principle, a regiment-wide boycott of the pay tables on paydays became the norm.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Shaw's death at Fort Wagner, Colonel Edward Needles Hallowell took up the fight to get full pay for the troops.[34] Lt. Col. Hooper took command of the regiment starting June 18, 1864. After nearly a month Colonel Hallowell returned on July 16.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nRefusing their reduced pay became a point of honor for the men of the 54th. In fact, at the Battle of Olustee, when ordered forward to protect the retreat of the Union forces, the men moved forward shouting, \\"Massachusetts and Seven Dollars a Month!\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Congressional bill, enacted on June 16, 1864, authorized equal and full pay to those enlisted troops who had been free men as of April 19, 1861. Of course not all the troops qualified. Colonel Hallowell, a Quaker, rationalized that because he did not believe in slavery he could therefore have all the troops swear that they were free men on April 19, 1861. Before being given their back pay the entire regiment was administered what became known as \\"the Quaker oath\\".[34] Colonel Hallowell skillfully crafted the oath to say: \\"You do solemnly swear that you owed no man unrequited labor on or before the 19th day of April 1861. So help you God\\".[34][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 28, 1864, the U.S. Congress took action to pay the men of the 54th. Most of the men had served 18 months.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nA monument to Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts regiment, constructed 1884ÿ1898 by Augustus Saint-Gaudens on the Boston Common, is part of the Boston Black Heritage Trail.[37] A plaster of this monument was also displayed in the entryway to the U.S. paintings galleries at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the regiment, Governor John A. Andrew said, \\"I know not where, in all of human history, to any given thousand men in arms there has been committed a work at once so proud, so precious, so full of hope and glory.\\"[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nA famous composition by Charles Ives, \\"Col. Shaw and his Colored Regiment\\", the opening movement of Three Places in New England, is based both on the monument and the regiment.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Shaw and his men also feature prominently in Robert Lowell's Civil War centennial poem \\"For the Union Dead.\\" It was originally titled \\"Colonel Shaw and the Massachusetts' 54th\\" and published in Life Studies (1959). In the poem, Lowell uses the Robert Gould Shaw memorial as a symbolic device to comment on broader societal change, including racism and segregation, as well as his more personal struggle to cope with a rapidly changing Boston.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Union officer had asked the Confederates at Battery Wagner for the return of Shaw's body, but was informed by the Confederate commander, Brigadier General Johnson Hagood, \\"We buried him with his niggers.\\"[41] Shaw's father wrote in response that he was proud that Robert, a fierce fighter for equality, had been buried in that manner.[42] \\"We hold that a soldier's most appropriate burial-place is on the field where he has fallen.\\"[43] As a recognition and honor, at the end of the Civil War, the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, and the 33rd Colored Regiment were mustered out at the Battery Wagner site of the mass burial of the 54th Massachusetts.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recently, the story of the unit was depicted in the 1989 Academy Award-winning film Glory, starring Matthew Broderick as Shaw, Denzel Washington as Private Tripp, Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes, Jihmi Kennedy and Andre Braugher.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film re-established the now-popular image of the combat role African Americans played in the Civil War, and the unit, often represented in historical battle reenactments, now has the nickname the \\"Glory\\" regiment.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unit was reactivated on November 21, 2008, to serve as the Massachusetts National Guard ceremonial unit to render military honors at funerals and state functions.

The central lobby is a living room done in immense scale with a massive fireplace and vast arching beams overhead, and furnished with chairs and sofas arranged around small coffee tables.\\r\\nMany of the items found throughout the hotel have been handcrafted by modern practitioners of the Arts and Crafts movement using traditional techniques. Some early Roycroft items are on display in the lobby.[1]\\r\\nSome of the hotel's rooms are tributes to various Craftsman-era architects and designers. For instance, two of the guest suites, as well as the California Boardroom, pay homage to Frank Lloyd Wright; the Napa Rose restaurant features a rose motif in the glass design which was inspired by Charles Rennie MacKintosh. The Storytellers Cafe features a large tile mural that is a reproduction of an original design by the Gladding, McBean Company for a Robin Hood Room in the Wilmington, California, public library.\\r\\nIts name is based on Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, its sister resort and Walt Disney World's flagship resort hotel. The two hotels do not share themes, though, as the Grand Californian is a Craftsman theme, while the Grand Floridian is of a Victorian theme. It does, however, share many thematic elements with Disney's Wilderness Lodge (also designed by Dominick) with its national park lodge theming at Walt Disney World.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hotel has an entrance to Disney California Adventure park, located at the Grizzly Peak area.\\r\\nThe hotel opened on January 2, 2001. At about 3:00 am on December 28, 2005, a Christmas tree in the main lobby caught fire after electric maintenance workers replaced lights on the tree. All 2,300 guests at the hotel were evacuated within four minutes. The fire was contained by the hotel's sprinkler system and by the Anaheim Fire Department. Two guests were treated for minor injuries, one of which was a severe headache. Guests were returned to their rooms by 7:00 am; some were sent to other hotels in the area.\\r\\nIn response to a growing demand for guest accommodations in Anaheim[citation needed], the Disneyland Resort announced on September 18, 2007 an expansion of Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa that would increase accommodations by more than 30 percent and include the first Disney Vacation Club villas in Anaheim. The 2.5-acre (10,000?m2) expansion on the hotel's south side added more than 200 new hotel rooms and 50 two-bedroom equivalent vacation villas and marked the West Coast debut of Disney Vacation Club, Disney's vacation-ownership program. During this expansion and renovation, a new swimming pool was added as well as a 300 space underground parking garage. Peter Dominick of 4240 Architecture Inc., architect for the original Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa designed the ambitious expansion to compliment his existing hotel. It reflects the same California Arts & Crafts architecture of the existing hotel, which immerses guests in a turn-of-the-20th-century California experience. The project was completed in September 2009.[2]\\r\\nWith the completion of this major expansion, Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa became the third largest hotel in Orange County, up from its previous fourth place standing.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Disney Vacation Club villas, added as part of the hotel's expansion, include kitchens, living and dining areas and other home-like amenities.

Clear records of the comet's appearances were made by Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European chroniclers, but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time. The comet's periodicity was first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley, after whom it is now named.\\r\\nDuring its 1986 apparition, Halley's Comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation.[15][16] These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple's \\"dirty snowball\\" model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices ÿ such as water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia ÿ and dust. The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy.\\r\\nComet Halley is commonly pronounced /?h?li/, rhyming with valley, or /?he?li/, rhyming with daily.[17][18] Colin Ronan, one of Edmund Halley's biographers, preferred /?h??li/ (HAW-lee, similar to holly). Spellings of Halley's name during his lifetime included Hailey, Haley, Hayley, Halley, Hawley, and Hawly, so its contemporary pronunciation is uncertain.[19]\\r\\nHalley was the first comet to be recognized as periodic. Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus on the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System.[20]\\r\\nIn 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his Philosophi? Naturalis Principia Mathematica, in which he outlined his laws of gravity and motion. His work on comets was decidedly incomplete. Although he had suspected that two comets that had appeared in succession in 1680 and 1681 were the same comet before and after passing behind the Sun (he was later found to be correct; see Newton's Comet),[21] he was unable to completely reconcile comets into his model.\\r\\nUltimately, it was Newton's friend, editor and publisher, Edmond Halley, who, in his 1705 Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets, used Newton's new laws to calculate the gravitational effects of Jupiter and Saturn on cometary orbits.[22] This calculation enabled him, after examining historical records, to determine that the orbital elements of a second comet that had appeared in 1682 were nearly the same as those of two comets that had appeared in 1531 (observed by Petrus Apianus) and 1607 (observed by Johannes Kepler).[22] Halley thus concluded that all three comets were, in fact, the same object returning about every 76 years, a period that has since been found to vary between 74ÿ79 years. After a rough estimate of the perturbations the comet would sustain from the gravitational attraction of the planets, he predicted its return for 1758.[23] Halley died in 1742 before he could observe this himself.[24]\\r\\nHalley's prediction of the comet's return proved to be correct, although it was not seen until 25 December 1758, by Johann Georg Palitzsch, a German farmer and amateur astronomer. It did not pass through its perihelion until 13 March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn having caused a retardation of 618 days.[25] This effect was computed prior to its return (with a one-month error to 13 April)[26] by a team of three French mathematicians, Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute.[27] The confirmation of the comet's return was the first time anything other than planets had been shown to orbit the Sun. It was also one of the earliest successful tests of Newtonian physics, and a clear demonstration of its explanatory power.[28] The comet was first named in Halley's honour by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1759.[28]\\r\\nSome scholars have proposed that first-century Mesopotamian astronomers already had recognized Halley's Comet as periodic.[29] This theory notes a passage in the Bavli Talmud[30] that refers to \\"a star which appears once in seventy years that makes the captains of the ships err.\\"[31]\\r\\nResearchers in 1981 attempting to calculate the past orbits of Halley by numerical integration starting from accurate observations in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries could not produce accurate results further back than 837 due to a close approach to Earth in that year. It was necessary to use ancient Chinese comet observations to constrain their calculations.[32]\\r\\nHalley's orbital period has varied between 74ÿ79 years since 240 BC.[28][11] Its orbit around the Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, the point in the comet's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU.[33] This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU (roughly the distance of Pluto). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18 to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. (Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162).[34] Due to the retrograde orbit, it has one of the highest velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56?km/s (157,838?mph or 254,016?km/h).[35] Because its orbit comes close to Earth's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October.[36] Halley is the parent body to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although it might not be the parent of that shower.[37]\\r\\nHalley is classified as a periodic or short-period comet; one with an orbit lasting 200 years or less.[38] This contrasts it with long-period comets, whose orbits last for thousands of years. Periodic comets have an average inclination to the ecliptic of only ten degrees, and an orbital period of just 6.5 years, so Halley's orbit is atypical.[28] Most short-period comets (those with orbital periods shorter than 20 years and inclinations of 20ÿ30 degrees or less) are called Jupiter-family comets. Those resembling Halley, with orbital periods of between 20 and 200 years and inclinations extending from zero to more than 90 degrees, are called Halley-type comets.[38][39] As of 2015[update], only 75 Halley-type comets have been observed, compared with 511 identified Jupiter family comets.[40]\\r\\nThe orbits of the Halley-type comets suggest that they were originally long-period comets whose orbits were perturbed by the gravity of the giant planets and directed into the inner Solar System.[38] If Halley was once a long-period comet, it is likely to have originated in the Oort Cloud,[39] a sphere of cometary bodies that has an inner edge of 20,000ÿ50,000 AU. Conversely the Jupiter-family comets are generally believed to originate in the Kuiper belt,[39] a flat disc of icy debris between 30 AU (Neptune's orbit) and 50 AU from the Sun (in the scattered disc). Another point of origin for the Halley-type comets was proposed in 2008, when a trans-Neptunian object with a retrograde orbit similar to Halley's was discovered, 2008 KV42, whose orbit takes it from just outside that of Uranus to twice the distance of Pluto. It may be a member of a new population of small Solar System bodies that serves as the source of Halley-type comets.[41]\\r\\nHalley has probably been in its current orbit for 16,000ÿ200,000 years, although it is not possible to numerically integrate its orbit for more than a few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations.[42] The non-gravitational effects can be crucial;[42] as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which knock it very slightly off its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion of four days, average.[43]\\r\\nIn 1989, Boris Chirikov and Vitaly Vecheslavov performed an analysis of 46 apparitions of Halley's Comet taken from historical records and computer simulations. These studies showed that its dynamics were chaotic and unpredictable on long timescales.[44] Halley's projected lifetime could be as long as 10?million years. More recent work suggests that Halley will evaporate, or split in two, within the next few tens of thousands of years, or will be ejected from the Solar System within a few hundred thousand years.[45][39] Observations by D.W. Hughes suggest that Halley's nucleus has been reduced in mass by 80ÿ90% over the last 2000ÿ3000 revolutions.[16]\\r\\nThe Giotto and Vega missions gave planetary scientists their first view of Halley's surface and structure. Like all comets, as Halley nears the Sun, its volatile compounds (those with low boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other ices) begin to sublime from the surface of its nucleus.[46] This causes the comet to develop a coma, or atmosphere, up to 100,000?km across.[2] Evaporation of this dirty ice releases dust particles, which travel with the gas away from the nucleus. Gas molecules in the coma absorb solar light and then re-radiate it at different wavelengths, a phenomenon known as fluorescence, whereas dust particles scatter the solar light. Both processes are responsible for making the coma visible.[13] As a fraction of the gas molecules in the coma are ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation,[13] pressure from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, pulls the coma's ions out into a long tail, which may extend more than 100?million?kilometers into space.[46][47] Changes in the flow of the solar wind can cause disconnection events, in which the tail completely breaks off from the nucleus.[15]\\r\\nDespite the vast size of its coma, Halley's nucleus is relatively small: barely 15?kilometers long, 8?kilometers wide and perhaps 8?kilometers thick.[b] Its shape vaguely resembles that of a peanut.[2] Its mass is relatively low (roughly 2.2?G?1014?kg)[4] and its average density is about 0.6?g/cm3, indicating that it is made of a large number of small pieces, held together very loosely, forming a structure known as a rubble pile.[5] Ground-based observations of coma brightness suggested that Halley's rotation period was about 7.4 days. Images taken by the various spacecraft, along with observations of the jets and shell, suggested a period of 52?hours.[16] Given the irregular shape of the nucleus, Halley's rotation is likely to be complex.[46] Although only 25% of Halley's surface was imaged in detail during the flyby missions, the images revealed an extremely varied topography, with hills, mountains, ridges, depressions, and at least one crater.[16]\\r\\nHalley is the most active of all the periodic comets, with others, such as Comet Encke and Comet Holmes, being one or two orders of magnitude less active.[16] Its day side (the side facing the Sun) is far more active than the night side. Spacecraft observations showed that the gases ejected from the nucleus were 80% water vapor, 17% carbon monoxide and 3ÿ4% carbon dioxide,[48] with traces of hydrocarbons[49] although more-recent sources give a value of 10% for carbon monoxide and also include traces of methane and ammonia.[50] The dust particles were found to be primarily a mixture of carbonÿhydrogenÿoxygenÿnitrogen (CHON) compounds common in the outer Solar System, and silicates, such as are found in terrestrial rocks.[46] The dust particles decreased in size down to the limits of detection (~0.001?m).[15] The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water released by Halley was initially thought to be similar to that found in Earth's ocean water, suggesting that Halley-type comets may have delivered water to Earth in the distant past. Subsequent observations showed Halley's deuterium ratio to be far higher than that found in Earth's oceans, making such comets unlikely sources for Earth's water.[46]\\r\\nGiotto provided the first evidence in support of Fred Whipple's \\"dirty snowball\\" hypothesis for comet construction; Whipple postulated that comets are icy objects warmed by the Sun as they approach the inner Solar System, causing ices on their surfaces to sublimate (change directly from a solid to a gas), and jets of volatile material to burst outward, creating the coma. Giotto showed that this model was broadly correct,[46] though with modifications. Halley's albedo, for instance, is about 4%, meaning that it reflects only 4% of the sunlight hitting it; about what one would expect for coal.[51] Thus, despite appearing brilliant white to observers on Earth, Halley's Comet is in fact pitch black. The surface temperature of evaporating \\"dirty ice\\" ranges from 170 K (?103?C) at higher albedo to 220?K (?53?C) at low albedo; Vega 1 found Halley's surface temperature to be in the range 300ÿ400 K (30ÿ130?C). This suggested that only 10% of Halley's surface was active, and that large portions of it were coated in a layer of dark dust that retained heat.[15] Together, these observations suggested that Halley was in fact predominantly composed of non-volatile materials, and thus more closely resembled a \\"snowy dirtball\\" than a \\"dirty snowball\\".[16][52]\\r\\nHalley may have been recorded as early as 467?BC, but this is uncertain. A comet was recorded in ancient Greece between 468 and 466 BC; its timing, location, duration, and associated meteor shower all suggest it was Halley.[53] According to Pliny the Elder, that same year a meteorite fell in the town of Aegospotami, in Thrace. He described it as brown in colour and the size of a wagon load.[54] Chinese chroniclers also mention a comet in that year.[55]\\r\\nThe first certain appearance of Halley's Comet in the historical record is a description from 240?BC, in the Chinese chronicle Records of the Grand Historian or Shiji, which describes a comet that appeared in the east and moved north.[56] The only surviving record of the 164?BC apparition is found on two fragmentary Babylonian tablets, now owned by the British Museum.[56]\\r\\nThe apparition of 87?BC was recorded in Babylonian tablets which state that the comet was seen \\"day beyond day\\" for a month.[57] This appearance may be recalled in the representation of Tigranes the Great, an Armenian king who is depicted on coins with a crown that features, according to Vahe Gurzadyan and R. Vardanyan, \\"a star with a curved tail [that] may represent the passage of Halley's Comet in 87?BC.\\" Gurzadyan and Vardanyan argue that \\"Tigranes could have seen Halley's Comet when it passed closest to the Sun on August 6 in 87?BC\\" as the comet would have been a \\"most recordable event\\"; for ancient Armenians it could have heralded the New Era of the brilliant King of Kings.[58]\\r\\nThe apparition of 12?BC was recorded in the Book of Han by Chinese astronomers of the Han Dynasty who tracked it from August through October.[10] It passed within 0.16?AU of Earth.[59] Halley's appearance in 12?BC, only a few years distant from the conventionally assigned date of the birth of Jesus Christ, has led some theologians and astronomers to suggest that it might explain the biblical story of the Star of Bethlehem. There are other explanations for the phenomenon, such as planetary conjunctions, and there are also records of other comets that appeared closer to the date of Jesus' birth.[60]\\r\\nIf, as has been suggested, the reference in the Talmud to \\"a star which appears once in seventy years that makes the captains of the ships err\\"[61] (see above) refers to Halley's Comet, it may be a reference to the 66?AD appearance, because this passage is attributed to the Rabbi Yehoshua ben Hananiah. This apparition was the only one to occur during ben Hananiah's lifetime.[62]\\r\\nThe 141?AD apparition was recorded in Chinese chronicles.[63] It was also recorded in the Tamil work Purananuru, in connection with the death of the south Indian Chera king Yanaikatchai Mantaran Cheral Irumporai.[64]\\r\\nThe 374?AD and 607 approaches each came within 0.09?AU of Earth.[59] The 684?AD apparition was recorded in Europe in one of the sources used by the compiler of the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicles. Chinese records also report it as the \\"broom star\\".[65]\\r\\nIn 837, Halley's Comet may have passed as close as 0.03?AU (3.2?million miles; 5.1?million kilometers) from Earth, by far its closest approach.[59] Its tail may have stretched 60?degrees across the sky. It was recorded by astronomers in China, Japan, Germany, the Byzantine Empire, and the Middle East.[10] In 912, Halley is recorded in the Annals of Ulster, which state \\"A dark and rainy year. A comet appeared.\\"[66]\\r\\nIn 1066, the comet was seen in England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings; it was a bad omen for Harold, but a good omen for the man who defeated him, William the Conqueror. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving accounts from the period describe it as appearing to be four times the size of Venus and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Halley came within 0.10?AU of Earth at that time.[59]\\r\\nThis appearance of the comet is also noted in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Eilmer of Malmesbury may have seen Halley previously in 989, as he wrote of it in 1066: \\"You've come, have you??... You've come, you source of tears to many mothers, you evil. I hate you! It is long since I saw you; but as I see you now you are much more terrible, for I see you brandishing the downfall of my country. I hate you!\\"[67]\\r\\nThe Irish Annals of the Four Masters recorded the comet as \\"A star [that] appeared on the seventh of the Calends of May, on Tuesday after Little Easter, than whose light the brilliance or light of The Moon was not greater; and it was visible to all in this manner till the end of four nights afterwards.\\"[66] Chaco Native Americans in New Mexico may have recorded the 1066 apparition in their petroglyphs.[68]\\r\\nThe 1145 apparition was recorded by the monk Eadwine. The 1986 apparition exhibited a fan tail similar to Eadwine's drawing.[65] Some claim that Genghis Khan was inspired to turn his conquests toward Europe by the 1222 apparition.[69] The 1301 apparition may have been seen by the artist Giotto di Bondone, who represented the Star of Bethlehem as a fire-colored comet in the Nativity section of his Arena Chapel cycle, completed in 1305.[65] Its 1378 appearance is recorded in the Annales Mediolanenses[70] as well as in East Asian sources.[71]\\r\\nIn 1456, the year of Halley's next apparition, the Ottoman Empire invaded the Kingdom of Hungary, culminating in the Siege of Belgrade in July of that year. In a papal bull, Pope Calixtus III ordered special prayers be said for the city's protection. In 1470, the humanist scholar Bartolomeo Platina wrote in his Lives of the Popes that,[72]\\r\\nA hairy and fiery star having then made its appearance for several days, the mathematicians declared that there would follow grievous pestilence, dearth and some great calamity. Calixtus, to avert the wrath of God, ordered supplications that if evils were impending for the human race He would turn all upon the Turks, the enemies of the Christian name. He likewise ordered, to move God by continual entreaty, that notice should be given by the bells to call the faithful at midday to aid by their prayers those engaged in battle with the Turk.\\r\\nPlatina's account is not mentioned in official records. In the 18th century, a Frenchman further embellished the story, in anger at the Church, by claiming that the Pope had \\"excommunicated\\" the comet, though this story was most likely his own invention.[73]\\r\\nHalley's apparition of 1456 was also witnessed in Kashmir and depicted in great detail by ?rؐvara, a Sanskrit poet and biographer to the Sultans of Kashmir. He read the apparition as a cometary portent of doom foreshadowing the imminent fall of Sultan Zayn al-Abidin (AD 1418/1420ÿ1470).[74]\\r\\nAfter witnessing a bright light in the sky which most historians have identified as Halley's Comet, Zara Yaqob, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1434 to 1468, founded the city of Debre Berhan (tr. City of Light) and made it his capital for the remainder of his reign.[75]\\r\\nHalley's periodic returns have been subject to scientific investigation since the 16th century. The three apparitions from 1531 to 1682 were noted by Edmond Halley, enabling him to predict its 1759 return.[76] Streams of vapour observed during the comet's 1835 apparition prompted astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel to propose that the jet forces of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit.[77]\\r\\nThe 1910 approach, which came into naked-eye view around 10 April[59] and came to perihelion on 20 April,[59] was notable for several reasons: it was the first approach of which photographs exist, and the first for which spectroscopic data were obtained.[15] Furthermore, the comet made a relatively close approach of 0.15 AU,[59] making it a spectacular sight. Indeed, on 19 May, Earth actually passed through the tail of the comet.[78][79] One of the substances discovered in the tail by spectroscopic analysis was the toxic gas cyanogen,[80] which led astronomer Camille Flammarion to claim that, when Earth passed through the tail, the gas \\"would impregnate the atmosphere and possibly snuff out all life on the planet.\\"[81] His pronouncement led to panicked buying of gas masks and quack \\"anti-comet pills\\" and \\"anti-comet umbrellas\\" by the public.[82] In reality, as other astronomers were quick to point out, the gas is so diffuse that the world suffered no ill effects from the passage through the tail.[81]\\r\\nThe comet added to the unrest in China on the eve of Xinhai Revolution that would end the last dynasty in 1911. As James Hutson, a missionary in Sichuan Province at the time, recorded,\\r\\nThe people believe that it indicates calamity such as war, fire, pestilence, and a change of dynasty. In some places on certain days the doors were unopened for half a day, no water was carried and many did not even drink water as it was rumoured that pestilential vapour was being poured down upon the earth from the comet.\\"[83]\\r\\nThe 1910 visitation is also recorded as being the travelling companion of the first known English Muslim to make the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca. However, his explanation of its scientific predictability did not meet with favour in the Holy City.[84]\\r\\nThe comet was also fertile ground for hoaxes. One that reached major newspapers claimed that the Sacred Followers, a supposed Oklahoma religious group, attempted to sacrifice a virgin to ward off the impending disaster, but were stopped by the police.[85]\\r\\nAmerican satirist and writer Mark Twain was born on 30 November 1835, exactly two weeks after the comet's perihelion. In his autobiography, published in 1909, he said,\\r\\nI came in with Halley's comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don't go out with Halley's comet. The Almighty has said, no doubt: 'Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.'[86][87]\\r\\nTwain died on 21 April 1910, the day following the comet's subsequent perihelion.[88] The 1985 fantasy film The Adventures of Mark Twain was inspired by the quotation.\\r\\nHalley's 1910 apparition is distinct from the Great Daylight Comet of 1910, which surpassed Halley in brilliance and was actually visible in broad daylight for a short period, approximately four months before Halley made its appearance.[89][90]\\r\\nHalley's 1986 apparition was the least favorable on record. The comet and Earth were on opposite sides of the Sun in February 1986, creating the worst viewing circumstances for Earth observers for the last 2,000 years.[91] Halley's closest approach was 0.42 AU.[92] Additionally, with increased light pollution from urbanization, many people failed to even see the comet. It was possible to observe it in areas outside of cities with the help of binoculars.[93] Further, the comet appeared brightest when it was almost invisible from the northern hemisphere in March and April.[94] Halley's approach was first detected by astronomers David Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson on 16 October 1982 using the 5.1?m Hale telescope at Mount Palomar and a CCD camera.[95] The first person to visually observe the comet on its 1986 return was amateur astronomer Stephen James O'Meara on 24 January 1985. O'Meara used a home-built 24-inch telescope on top of Mauna Kea to detect the magnitude 19.6 comet.[96] On 8 November 1985, Stephen Edberg (then serving as the Coordinator for Amateur Observations at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and Charles Morris were the first to observe Halley's Comet with the naked eye in its 1986 apparition.[97][98]\\r\\nThe development of space travel gave scientists the opportunity to study the comet at close quarters, and several probes were launched to do so. The Soviet Vega 1 started returning images of Halley on 4 March 1986, and the first ever of its nucleus,[16] and made its flyby on 6 March, followed by Vega 2 making its flyby on 9 March. On 14 March, the Giotto space probe, launched by the European Space Agency, made the closest pass of the comet's nucleus.[16] There were also two Japanese probes, Suisei and Sakigake. The probes were unofficially known as the Halley Armada.[99]\\r\\nBased on data retrieved by Astron, the largest ultraviolet space telescope of the time, during its Halley's Comet observations in December 1985, a group of Soviet scientists developed a model of the comet's coma.[100] The comet was also observed from space by the International Cometary Explorer. Originally International Sun-Earth Explorer 3, the probe was renamed and freed from its L1 Lagrangian point location in Earth's orbit to intercept comets 21P/Giacobini-Zinner and Halley.[101]\\r\\nTwo Space Shuttle missions ÿ the ill-fated STS-51-L (ended by the Challenger disaster)[102] and STS-61-E ÿ were scheduled to observe Halley's Comet from low Earth orbit. STS-51-L carried the Shuttle-Pointed Tool for Astronomy (SPARTAN-203) satellite, also called the Halley's Comet Experiment Deployable (HCED).[103] STS-61-E was a Columbia mission scheduled for March 1986, carrying the ASTRO-1 platform to study the comet.[104] Due to the suspension of America's manned space program after the Challenger explosion, the mission was canceled, and ASTRO-1 would not fly until late 1990 on STS-35.[105]\\r\\nOn 12 February 1991, at a distance of 14.4?AU (2.15G109?km) from the Sun, Halley displayed an outburst that lasted for several months, releasing a cloud of dust 300,000?km across.[46] The outburst likely started in December 1990, and then the comet brightened from magnitude 24.3 to magnitude 18.9.[106] Halley was most recently observed in 2003 by three of the Very Large Telescopes at Paranal, Chile, when Halley's magnitude was 28.2. The telescopes observed Halley, at the faintest and farthest any comet has ever been imaged, in order to verify a method for finding very faint trans-Neptunian objects.[9] Astronomers are now able to observe the comet at any point in its orbit.[9]\\r\\nThe next predicted perihelion of Halley's Comet is 28 July 2061,[1] when it is expected to be better positioned for observation than during the 1985ÿ1986 apparition, as it will be on the same side of the Sun as Earth.[11] It is expected to have an apparent magnitude of ?0.3, compared with only +2.1 for the 1986 apparition.[107] It has been calculated that on 9 September 2060, Halley will pass within 0.98?AU (147,000,000?km) of Jupiter, and then on 20 August 2061 will pass within 0.0543?AU (8,120,000?km) of Venus.[108] In 2134, Halley is expected to pass within 0.09?AU (13,000,000?km) of Earth.[108] Its apparent magnitude is expected to be ?2.0.[107]\\r\\nHalley's calculations enabled the comet's earlier appearances to be found in the historical record. The following table sets out the astronomical designations for every apparition of Halley's Comet from 240?BC, the earliest documented widespread sighting.[3][109] For example, \\"1P/1982?U1, 1986?III, 1982i\\" indicates that for the perihelion in 1986, Halley was the first period comet known (designated 1P) and this apparition was the first seen in half-month U (the second half of October)[110] in 1982 (giving 1P/1982 U1); it was the third comet past perihelion in 1986 (1986 III); and it was the ninth comet spotted in 1982 (provisional designation 1982i). The perihelion dates of each apparition are shown.[111] The perihelion dates farther from the present are approximate, mainly because of uncertainties in the modelling of non-gravitational effects. Perihelion dates of 1531 and earlier are in the Julian calendar, while perihelion dates 1607 and after are in the Gregorian calendar.[112]","field3":"What is the furthest distance that halleys comet travels from the sun?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"January 1, 1979","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The United States Office of Personnel Management (acronym: OPM) is an independent agency of the United States federal government that manages the government's civilian workforce.

While technically employees of the agencies they work for, Administrative Law Judges (or ALJs) are hired exclusively by the OPM, effectively removing any discretional employment procedures from the other agencies. The OPM uses a rigorous selection process which ranks the top three candidates for each ALJ vacancy, and then makes a selection from those candidates, generally giving preference to veterans.\\r\\nThe OPM is also responsible for a large part of the management of security clearances (National Background Investigations Bureau conducts these investigations) for the United States Government.

Farenthold introduced the bill as a response to accusations of fraud and concerns about security clearance background investigations.[16] The bill would fund the expenses for investigations, oversight activities and audits from the revolving fund.[17] In February 2014, President Obama signed the bill into law.[18]\\r\\nThe funds history goes back to the early 1980s, where it was used for two main activities: training and background investigations for government personnel.[19]\\r\\nIn June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management announced that it had discovered in April 2015 that it had been hacked more than a year earlier in a data breach, resulting in the theft of approximately 4 million personnel records handled by the office.[20] The Washington Post has reported that the attack originated in China, citing unnamed government officials.[21] By July 9, 2015 the estimate of stolen records had increased to 21.5 million, including those of current government personnel and people who had undergone background checks.[22]\\r\\nNew updates regarding this security breach came to light on September 24, 2015. The agency then indicated that additional evidence showed that 5.6 million people's fingerprints were stolen as part of the hacks, more than five times the 1.1 million originally estimated. The total number of individuals whose records were disclosed in whole or part, including Social Security numbers and addresses, remained at 21.5 million.[23]\\r\\nSource: OPM's Agency Leadership Through Time[24]","field3":"When was the office of personnel management established?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"discusses art and art's audience","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" is a poem written by the English Romantic poet John Keats in May 1819 and published anonymously in the January 1820, Number 15, issue of the magazine Annals of the Fine Arts (see 1820 in poetry).\\r\\nThe poem is one of several \\"Great Odes of 1819\\", which includes \\"Ode on Indolence\\", \\"Ode on Melancholy\\", \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\", and \\"Ode to Psyche\\". Keats found earlier forms of poetry unsatisfactory for his purpose, and the collection represented a new development of the ode form. He was inspired to write the poem after reading two articles by English artist and writer Benjamin Haydon. Keats was aware of other works on classical Greek art, and had first-hand exposure to the Elgin Marbles, all of which reinforced his belief that classical Greek art was idealistic and captured Greek virtues, which forms the basis of the poem.\\r\\nDivided into five stanzas of ten lines each, the ode contains a narrator's discourse on a series of designs on a Grecian urn. The poem focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover eternally pursues a beloved without fulfilment, and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines of the poem declare that \\"'beauty is truth, truth beauty,' ÿ that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\\", and literary critics have debated whether they increase or diminish the overall beauty of the poem. Critics have focused on other aspects of the poem, including the role of the narrator, the inspirational qualities of real-world objects, and the paradoxical relationship between the poem's world and reality.\\r\\n\\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" was not well received by contemporary critics. It was only by the mid-19th century that it began to be praised, although it is now considered to be one of the greatest odes in the English language.[1] A long debate over the poem's final statement divided 20th-century critics, but most agreed on the beauty of the work, despite various perceived inadequacies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the spring of 1819, Keats had left his job as dresser, or assistant house surgeon, at Guy's Hospital, Southwark, London, to devote himself entirely to the composition of poetry. Living with his friend Charles Brown, the 23-year-old was burdened with money problems and despaired when his brother George sought his financial assistance. These real-world difficulties may have given Keats pause for thought about a career in poetry, yet he did manage to complete five odes, including \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\", \\"Ode to Psyche\\", \\"Ode on Melancholy\\", \\"Ode on Indolence\\", and \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\".[2] The poems were transcribed by Brown, who later provided copies to the publisher Richard Woodhouse. Their exact date of composition is unknown; Keats simply dated \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" May 1819, as he did its companion odes. While the five poems display a unity in stanza forms and themes, the unity fails to provide clear evidence of the order in which they were composed.[3]\\r\\nIn the odes of 1819 Keats explores his contemplations about relationships between the soul, eternity, nature, and art. His idea of using classical Greek art as a metaphor originated in his reading of Haydon's Examiner articles of 2 May and 9 May 1819. In the first article, Haydon described Greek sacrifice and worship, and in the second article, he contrasted the artistic styles of Raphael and Michelangelo in conjunction with a discussion of medieval sculptures. Keats also had access to prints of Greek urns at Haydon's office,[4] and he traced an engraving of the \\"Sosibios Vase\\", a Neo-Attic marble volute krater, signed by Sosibios, in The Louvre,[5] which he found in Henry Moses's A Collection of Antique Vases, Altars, Paterae.[6][7]\\r\\nKeats's inspiration for the topic was not limited to Haydon, but embraced many contemporary sources.[8] He may have recalled his experience with the Elgin Marbles[9] and their influence on his sonnet \\"On Seeing the Elgin Marbles\\".[10] Keats was also exposed to the Townley, Borghese, and Holland House vases and to the classical treatment of subjects in Robert Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy. Many contemporary essays and articles on these works shared Keats's view that classical Greek art was both idealistic and captured Greek virtues. Although he was influenced by examples of existing Greek vases, in the poem he attempted to describe an ideal artistic type, rather than a specific original vase.[11]\\r\\nAlthough \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" was completed in May 1819, its first printing came in January 1820 when it was published with \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" in the Annals of Fine Art, an art magazine that promoted views on art similar to those Keats held.[12] Following the initial publication, the Examiner published Keats's ode together with Haydon's two previously published articles.[13] Keats also included the poem in his 1820 collection Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St Agnes, and Other Poems.[14]\\r\\nIn 1819, Keats had attempted to write sonnets, but found that the form did not satisfy his purpose because the pattern of rhyme worked against the tone that he wished to achieve. When he turned to the ode form, he found that the standard Pindaric form used by poets such as John Dryden was inadequate for properly discussing philosophy.[15] Keats developed his own type of ode in \\"Ode to Psyche\\", which preceded \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" and other odes he wrote in 1819. Keats's creation established a new poetic tone that accorded with his aesthetic ideas about poetry. He further altered this new form in \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" and \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" by adding a secondary voice within the ode, creating a dialogue between two subjects.[16] The technique of the poem is ekphrasis, the poetic representation of a painting or sculpture in words. Keats broke from the traditional use of ekphrasis found in Theocritus's Idyll, a classical poem that describes a design on the sides of a cup. While Theocritus describes both motion found in a stationary artwork and underlying motives of characters, \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" replaces actions with a series of questions and focuses only on external attributes of the characters.[17]\\r\\n\\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" is organized into ten-line stanzas, beginning with an ABAB rhyme scheme and ending with a Miltonic sestet (1st and 5th stanzas CDEDCE, 2nd stanza CDECED, and 3rd and 4th stanzas CDECDE). The same overall pattern is used in \\"Ode on Indolence\\", \\"Ode on Melancholy\\", and \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" (though their sestet rhyme schemes vary), which makes the poems unified in structure as well as theme.[3] The word \\"ode\\" itself is of Greek origin, meaning \\"sung\\". While ode-writers from antiquity adhered to rigid patterns of strophe, antistrophe, and epode, the form by Keats's time had undergone enough transformation that it represented a manner rather than a set method for writing a certain type of lyric poetry. Keats's odes seek to find a \\"classical balance\\" between two extremes, and in the structure of \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\", these extremes are the symmetrical structure of classical literature and the asymmetry of Romantic poetry. The use of the ABAB structure in the beginning lines of each stanza represents a clear example of structure found in classical literature, and the remaining six lines appear to break free of the traditional poetic styles of Greek and Roman odes.[18]\\r\\nKeats's metre reflects a conscious development in his poetic style. The poem contains only a single instance of medial inversion (the reversal of an iamb in the middle of a line), which was common in his earlier works. However, Keats incorporates spondees in 37 of the 250 metrical feet. Caesurae are never placed before the fourth syllable in a line. The word choice represents a shift from Keats's early reliance on Latinate polysyllabic words to shorter, Germanic words. In the second stanza, \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\", which emphasizes words containing the letters \\"p\\", \\"b\\", and \\"v\\", uses syzygy, the repetition of a consonantal sound. The poem incorporates a complex reliance on assonance, which is found in very few English poems. Within \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\", an example of this pattern can be found in line 13 (\\"Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd\\") where the \\"e\\" of \\"sensual\\" connects with the \\"e\\" of \\"endear'd\\" and the \\"ea\\" of \\"ear\\" connects with the \\"ea\\" of \\"endear'd\\". A more complex form is found in line 11 (\\"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard\\") with the \\"ea\\" of \\"Heard\\" connecting to the \\"ea\\" of \\"unheard\\", the \\"o\\" of \\"melodies\\" connecting to the \\"o\\" of \\"those\\" and the \\"u\\" of \\"but\\" connecting to the \\"u\\" of \\"unheard\\".[19]\\r\\nThe poem begins with the narrator's silencing the urn by describing it as the \\"bride of quietness\\", which allows him to speak for it using his own impressions.[20] The narrator addresses the urn by saying:\\r\\nThou still unravish'd bride of quietness!\\r\\nThou foster-child of silence and slow time (lines 1ÿ2)\\r\\nThe urn is a \\"foster-child of silence and slow time\\" because it was created from stone and made by the hand of an artist who did not communicate through words. As stone, time has little effect on it and ageing is such a slow process that it can be seen as an eternal piece of artwork. The urn is an external object capable of producing a story outside the time of its creation, and because of this ability the poet labels it a \\"sylvan historian\\" that tells its story through its beauty:[21]\\r\\nSylvan historian, who canst thus express\\r\\nA flow'ry tale more sweetly than our rhyme:\\r\\nWhat leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape\\r\\nOf deities or mortals, or of both,\\r\\nIn Tempe or the dales of Arcady?\\r\\nWhat men or gods are these? What maidens loth?\\r\\nWhat mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?\\r\\nWhat pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy? (lines 3ÿ10)\\r\\nThe questions presented in these lines are too ambiguous to allow the reader to understand what is taking place in the images on the urn, but elements of it are revealed: there is a pursuit with a strong sexual component.[22] The melody accompanying the pursuit is intensified in the second stanza:[23]\\r\\nHeard melodies are sweet, but those unheard\\r\\nAre sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;\\r\\nNot to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,\\r\\nPipe to the spirit ditties of no tone: (lines 11ÿ14)\\r\\nThere is a hint of a paradox in that indulgence causes someone to be filled with desire and that music without a sound is desired by the soul. There is a stasis that prohibits the characters on the urn from ever being fulfilled:[23]\\r\\nBold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,\\r\\nThough winning near the goal ÿ yet, do not grieve;\\r\\nShe cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,\\r\\nFor ever wilt thou love, and she be fair! (lines 17ÿ20)\\r\\nIn the third stanza, the narrator begins by speaking to a tree, which will ever hold its leaves and will not \\"bid the Spring adieu\\". The paradox of life versus lifelessness extends beyond the lover and the fair lady and takes a more temporal shape as three of the ten lines begin with the words \\"for ever\\". The unheard song never ages and the pipes are able to play forever, which leads the lovers, nature, and all involved to be:[23]\\r\\nFor ever panting, and for ever young;\\r\\nAll breathing human passion far above,\\r\\nThat leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloyed,\\r\\nA burning forehead, and a parching tongue. (lines 27ÿ30)\\r\\nA new paradox arises in these lines because these immortal lovers are experiencing a living death.[24] To overcome this paradox of merged life and death, the poem shifts to a new scene with a new perspective.[24] The fourth stanza opens with the sacrifice of a virgin cow, an image that appeared in the Elgin Marbles, Claude Lorrain's Sacrifice to Apollo, and Raphael's The Sacrifice at Lystra[25][A 1]\\r\\nWho are these coming to the sacrifice?\\r\\nTo what green altar, O mysterious priest,\\r\\nLead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,\\r\\nAnd all her silken flanks with garlands drest?\\r\\nWhat little town by river or sea shore,\\r\\nOr mountain-built with peaceful citadel,\\r\\nIs emptied of its folk, this pious morn?\\r\\nAnd, little town, thy streets for evermore\\r\\nWill silent be; and not a soul to tell\\r\\nWhy thou art desolate, can e'er return. (lines 31ÿ40)\\r\\nAll that exists in the scene is a procession of individuals, and the narrator conjectures on the rest. The altar and town exist as part of a world outside art, and the poem challenges the limitations of art through describing their possible existence. The questions are unanswered because there is no one who can ever know the true answers, as the locations are not real. The final stanza begins with a reminder that the urn is a piece of eternal artwork:[26]\\r\\nO Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede\\r\\nOf marble men and maidens overwrought,\\r\\nWith forest branches and the trodden weed;\\r\\nThou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought\\r\\nAs doth eternity: Cold pastoral! (lines 41ÿ45)\\r\\nThe audience is limited in its ability to comprehend the eternal scene, but the silent urn is still able to speak to them. The story it tells is both cold and passionate, and it is able to help mankind. The poem concludes with the urn's message:[27]\\r\\nWhen old age shall this generation waste,\\r\\nThou shalt remain, in midst of other woe\\r\\nThan ours, a friend to man, to whom thou sayst,\\r\\n\\"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\\" ÿ that is all\\r\\nYe know on earth, and all ye need to know. (lines 46ÿ50)\\r\\nLike many of Keats's odes, \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" discusses art and art's audience. He relied on depictions of natural music in earlier poems, and works such as \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" appeal to auditory sensations while ignoring the visual. Keats reverses this when describing an urn within \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" to focus on representational art. He previously used the image of an urn in \\"Ode on Indolence\\", depicting one with three figures representing Love, Ambition and Poesy. Of these three, Love and Poesy are integrated into \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" with an emphasis on how the urn, as a human artistic construct, is capable of relating to the idea of \\"Truth\\". The images of the urn described within the poem are intended as obvious depictions of common activities: an attempt at courtship, the making of music, and a religious rite. The figures are supposed to be beautiful, and the urn itself is supposed to be realistic.[28] Although the poem does not include the subjective involvement of the narrator, the description of the urn within the poem implies a human observer that draws out these images.[29] The narrator interacts with the urn in a manner similar to how a critic would respond to the poem, which creates ambiguity in the poem's final lines: \\"'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,' ÿ that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\\" The lack of a definite voice of the urn causes the reader to question who is really speaking these words, to whom they are speaking, and what is meant by the words, which encourages the reader to interact with the poem in an interrogative manner like the narrator.[30]\\r\\nAs a symbol, an urn cannot completely represent poetry, but it does serve as one component in describing the relationship between art and humanity.[31] The nightingale of \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" is separated from humanity and does not have human concerns. In contrast, being a piece of art, the urn requires an audience and is in an incomplete state on its own. This allows the urn to interact with humanity, to put forth a narrative, and allows for the imagination to operate. The images on the urn provoke the narrator to ask questions, and the silence of the urn reinforces the imagination's ability to operate. This interaction and use of the imagination is part of a greater tradition called ut pictura poesis ÿ the contemplation of art by a poet ÿ which serves as a meditation upon art itself.[32] In this meditation, the narrator dwells on the aesthetic and mimetic features of art. The beginning of the poem posits that the role of art is to describe a specific story about those with whom the audience is unfamiliar, and the narrator wishes to know the identity of the figures in a manner similar to \\"Ode on Indolence\\" and \\"Ode to Psyche\\". The figures on the urn within \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" lack identities, but the first section ends with the narrator believing that if he knew the story, he would know their names. The second section of the poem, describing the piper and the lovers, meditates on the possibility that the role of art is not to describe specifics but universal characters, which falls under the term \\"Truth\\". The three figures would represent how Love, Beauty, and Art are unified together in an idealised world where art represents the feelings of the audience. The audience is not supposed to question the events but instead to rejoice in the happy aspects of the scene in a manner that reverses the claims about art in \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\". Similarly, the response of the narrator to the sacrifice is not compatible with the response of the narrator to the lovers.[33]\\r\\nThe two contradictory responses found in the first and second scenes of \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" are inadequate for completely describing art, because Keats believed that art should not provide history or ideals. Instead, both are replaced with a philosophical tone that dominates the meditation on art. The sensual aspects are replaced with an emphasis on the spiritual aspects, and the last scene describes a world contained unto itself. The relationship between the audience with the world is for benefiting or educating, but merely to emphatically connect to the scene. In the scene, the narrator contemplates where the boundaries of art lie and how much an artist can represent on an urn. The questions the narrator asks reveal a yearning to understand the scene, but the urn is too limited to allow such answers. Furthermore, the narrator is able to visualise more than what actually exists on the urn. This conclusion on art is both satisfying, in that it allows the audience to actually connect with the art, and alienating, as it does not provide the audience the benefit of instruction or narcissistic fulfilment.[34] Besides the contradictions between the various desires within the poem, there are other paradoxes that emerge as the narrator compares his world with that of the figures on the urn. In the opening line, he refers to the urn as a \\"bride of quietness\\", which serves to contrast the urn with the structure of the ode, a type of poem originally intended to be sung. Another paradox arises when the narrator describes immortals on the side of an urn meant to carry the ashes of the dead.[35]\\r\\nIn terms of the actual figures upon the urn, the image of the lovers depicts the relationship of passion and beauty with art. In \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" and \\"Ode on Melancholy\\", Keats describes how beauty is temporary. However, the figures of the urn are able to always enjoy their beauty and passion because of their artistic permanence.[36] The urn's description as a bride invokes a possibility of consummation, which is symbolic of the urn's need for an audience. Charles Patterson, in a 1954 essay, explains that \\"It is erroneous to assume that here Keats is merely disparaging the bride of flesh wed to man and glorifying the bride of marble wed to quietness. He could have achieved that simple effect more deftly with some other image than the richly ambivalent unravished bride, which conveys?... a hint of disparagement: It is natural for brides to be possessed physically?... it is unnatural for them not to be.\\"[37] John Jones, in his 1969 analysis, emphasises this sexual dimension within the poem by comparing the relationship between \\"the Eve Adam dreamed of and who was there when he woke up\\" and the \\"bridal urn\\" of \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\".[38] Helen Vendler expands on the idea, in her 1983 analysis of Keats's odes, when she claimed \\"the complex mind writing the Urn connects stillness and quietness to ravishment and a bride\\".[39] In the second stanza, Keats \\"voices the generating motive of the poem ÿ the necessary self-exhaustion and self-perpetuation of sexual appetite.\\"[40] To Vendler, desire and longing could be the source of artistic creativity, but the urn contains two contradicting expressions of sexuality: a lover chasing after a beloved and a lover with his beloved. This contradiction reveals Keats's belief that such love in general was unattainable and that \\"The true opponent to the urn-experience of love is not satisfaction but extinction.\\"[41]\\r\\nThe first response to the poem came in an anonymous review in the July 1820 Monthly Review, which claimed, \\"Mr Keats displays no great nicety in his selection of images. According to the tenets of that school of poetry to which he belongs, he thinks that any thing or object in nature is a fit material on which the poet may work?... Can there be a more pointed concetto than this address to the Piping Shepherds on a Grecian Urn?\\"[42] Another anonymous review followed in the 29 July 1820 Literary Chronicle and Weekly Review that quoted the poem with a note that said that \\"Among the minor poems, many of which possess considerable merit, the following appears to be the best\\".[43] Josiah Conder, in a September 1820 Eclectic Review, argues that:\\r\\nMr Keats, seemingly, can think or write of scarcely any thing else than the 'happy pieties' of Paganism. A Grecian Urn throws him into an ecstasy: its 'silent form,' he says, 'doth tease us out of thought as doth Eternity,'a very happy description of the bewildering effect which such subjects have at least had upon his own mind; and his fancy having thus got the better of his reason, we are the less surprised at the oracle which the Urn is made to utter:\\r\\n'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,'that is all\\r\\nYe know on earth, and all ye need to know.\\r\\nGeorge Gilfillan, in an 1845 essay on Keats, placed the poem among \\"The finest of Keats' smaller pieces\\" and suggested that \\"In originality, Keats has seldom been surpassed. His works 'rise like an exhalation.' His language has been formed on a false system; but, ere he died, was clarifying itself from its more glaring faults, and becoming copious clear, and select. He seems to have been averse to all speculative thought, and his only creed, we fear, was expressed in the words Beauty is truth,truth beauty\\".[45] The 1857 Encyclop?dia Britannica contained an article on Keats by Alexander Smith, which stated: \\"Perhaps the most exquisite specimen of Keats' poetry is the 'Ode to the Grecian Urn'; it breathes the very spirit of antiquity,eternal beauty and eternal repose.\\"[46] During the mid-19th century, Matthew Arnold claimed that the passage describing the little town \\"is Greek, as Greek as a thing from Homer or Theocritus; it is composed with the eye on the object, a radiancy and light clearness being added.\\"[47]\\r\\nThe 20th century marked the beginning of a critical dispute over the final lines of the poem and their relationship to the beauty of the whole work. Poet laureate Robert Bridges sparked the debate when he argued:\\r\\nThe thought as enounced in the first stanza is the supremacy of ideal art over Nature, because of its unchanging expression of perfect; and this is true and beautiful; but its amplification in the poem is unprogressive, monotonous, and scattered?... which gives an effect of poverty in spite of the beauty. The last stanza enters stumbling upon a pun, but its concluding lines are very fine, and make a sort of recovery with their forcible directness.[48]\\r\\nBridges believed that the final lines redeemed an otherwise bad poem. Arthur Quiller-Couch responded with a contrary view and claimed that the lines were \\"a vague observation ÿ to anyone whom life has taught to face facts and define his terms, actually an uneducated conclusion, albeit most pardonable in one so young and ardent.\\"[48] The debate expanded when I.?A. Richards, an English literary critic who analysed Keats's poems in 1929, relied on the final lines of the \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" to discuss \\"pseudo-statements\\" in poetry:\\r\\nOn the one hand there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its statements seriously ÿ and find them silly?... This may seem an absurd mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand there are those who succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty?...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as the expression of a certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness as a result of their linguistic naivety.[49]\\r\\nPoet and critic T. S. Eliot, in his 1929 \\"Dante\\" essay, responded to Richards:\\r\\nI am at first inclined to agree?... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line strikes me as a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement?... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps the fact that it is grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.[50]\\r\\nIn 1930, John Middleton Murry gave a history of these responses \\"to show the astonishing variety of opinion which exists at this day concerning the culmination of a poem whose beauty has been acknowledged for many years. Whether such another cause, and such another example, of critical diversity exists, I cannot say; if it does, it is unknown to me. My own opinion concerning the value of those two lines in the context of the poem itself is not very different from Mr. Eliot's.\\"[51]\\r\\nCleanth Brooks defended the lines from critics in 1947 and argued:\\r\\nWe shall not feel that the generalization, unqualified and to be taken literally, is meant to march out of its context to compete with the scientific and philosophical generalizations which dominate our world. 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty' has precisely the same status, and the same justification as Shakespeare's 'Ripeness is all.' It is a speech 'in character' and supported by a dramatic context. To conclude thus may seem to weight the principle of dramatic propriety with more than it can bear. This would not be fair to the complexity of the problem of truth in art nor fair to Keats's little parable. Granted; and yet the principle of dramatic propriety may take us further than would first appear. Respect for it may at least insure our dealing with the problem of truth at the level on which it is really relevant to literature.[52]\\r\\nM. H. Abrams responded to Brooks's view in 1957:\\r\\nI entirely agree, then, with Professor Brooks in his explication of the Ode, that 'Beauty is truth' ... is to be considered as a speech 'in character' and 'dramatically appropriate' to the Urn. I am uneasy, however, about his final reference to 'the world-view?...' For the poem as a whole is equally an utterance by a dramatically presented speaker, and none of its statements is proffered for our endorsement as a philosophical generalization of unlimited scope. They are all, therefore, to be apprehended as histrionic elements which are 'in character' and 'dramatically appropriate,' for their inherent interest as stages in the evolution of an artistically ordered?... experience of a credible human being.[53]\\r\\nEarl Wasserman, in 1953, continued the discussion over the final lines and claimed, \\"the more we tug at the final lines of the ode, the more the noose of their meaning strangles our comprehension of the poem?... The aphorism is all the more beguiling because it appears near the end of the poem, for its apparently climactic position has generally led to the assumption that it is the abstract summation of the poem?... But the ode is not an abstract statement or an excursion into philosophy. It is a poem about things\\".[54]\\r\\nWalter Evert, discussing the debate in 1965, justified the final lines of the poem to declare \\"The poem, then, accepts the urn for the immediate meditative imaginative pleasure that it can give, but it firmly defines the limits of artistic truth. In this it is wholly consistent with all the great poetry of Keats's last creative period.\\"[55] Hugh Kenner, in 1971, explained that Keats \\"interrogates an urn, and answers for it, and its last answer, about Beauty and Truth, may seem almost intolerably enigmatic\\".[56] To Kenner, the problem with Keats's Beauty and Truth statement arises out of the reader's inability to distinguish between the poet, his reflections on the urn, and any possible statement made by the urn. He concluded that Keats fails to provide his narrator with enough characterization to be able to speak for the urn.[56] Charles Rzepka, in 1986, offered his view on the matter: \\"The truth-beauty equation at the end of the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' offers solace but is finally no more convincing than the experience it describes is durable.\\"[57] Rick Rylance picked up the debate again in 1990 and explained that the true meaning of the final lines cannot be discerned merely by studying the language. This posed a problem for the New Critics, who were prone to closely reading a poem's text.[58]\\r\\nNot every 20th-century critic opined primarily on the quality of the final lines when discussing the success or failure of the poem; Sidney Colvin, in 1920, explained that \\"while imagery drawn from the sculptures on Greek vases was still floating through his mind, he was able to rouse himself to a stronger effort and produce a true masterpiece in his famous Ode on a Grecian Urn.\\"[59] In his 1926 analysis, H. W. Garrod felt that the end of the poem did not match with the rest of the poem: \\"Perhaps the fourth stanza is more beautiful than any of the othersand more true. The trouble is that it is a little too true. Truth to his main theme has taken Keats rather farther than he meant to go?... This pure cold art makes, in fact, a less appeal to Keats than the Ode as a whole would pretend; and when, in the lines that follow these lines, he indulges the jarring apostrophe 'Cold Pastoral' [...] he has said more than he meantor wished to mean.\\"[60] In 1933, M. R. Ridley described the poem as a \\"tense ethereal beauty\\" with a \\"touch of didacticism that weakens the urgency\\" of the statements.[61] Douglas Bush, following in 1937, emphasized the Greek aspects of the poem and stated, \\"as in the Ode to Maia, the concrete details are suffused with a rich nostalgia. The hard edges of classical Greek writing are softened by the enveloping emotion and suggestion. In his classical moments Keats is a sculptor whose marble becomes flesh.\\"[62]\\r\\nIn 1954, Charles Patterson defended the poem and claimed, \\"The meaningfulness and range of the poem, along with its controlled execution and powerfully suggestive imagery, entitle it to a high place among Keats's great odes. It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of To Autumn but is much superior in these qualities to the Ode to a Nightingale despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over-all structure. In fact, the Ode on a Grecian Urn may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in something approaching its true complexity and human wisdom.\\"[63] Walter Jackson Bate argued in 1962 that \\"the Grecian Urn possesses a quiet and constrained composure hardly equaled by the other odes of this month and perhaps even unsurpassed by the ode To Autumn of the following September?... there is a severe repose about the Ode on a Grecian Urn; it is both 'interwoven' and 'complete'; and within its tensely braced stanzas is a potential energy momentarily stilled and imprisoned.\\"[64] In 1964, literary critic David Perkins claimed in his essay \\"The Ode on a Nightingale\\" that the symbol of the urn \\"may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry?... but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions\\".[31]\\r\\nF. W. Bateson emphasized in 1966 the poem's ability to capture truth: \\"The Ode to a Nightingale had ended with the explicit admission that the 'fancy' is a 'cheat,' and the Grecian Urn concludes with a similar repudiation. But this time it is a positive instead of a negative conclusion. There is no escape from the 'woe' that 'shall this generation waste,' but the action of time can be confronted and seen in its proper proportions. To enable its readers to do this is the special function of poetry.\\"[65] Ronald Sharp followed in 1979 with a claim that the theme of \\"the relationship between life and art?... receives its most famous, and its most enigmatic and controversial, treatment\\" within the poem.[66] In 1983, Vendler praised many of the passages within the poem but argued that the poem was unable to fully represent what Keats wanted: \\"The simple movement of entrance and exit, even in its triple repetition in the Urn, is simply not structurally complex enough to be adequate, as a representational form, to what we know of aesthetic experience ÿ or indeed to human experience generally.\\"[67] Later in 1989, Daniel Watkins claimed the poem as \\"one of [Keats's] most beautiful and problematic works.\\"[68]\\r\\nAndrew Bennett, in 1994, discussed the poem's effectiveness: \\"What is important and compelling in this poem is not so much what happens on the urn or in the poem, but the way that a response to an artwork both figures and prefigures its own critical response\\".[69] In 1999, Andrew Motion claimed that the poem \\"tells a story that cannot be developed. Celebrating the transcendent powers of art, it creates a sense of imminence, but also registers a feeling of frustration.\\"[6] Ayumi Mizukoshi, in 2001, argued that early audiences did not support \\"Ode to Psyche\\" because it \\"turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture. For the same reason, the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' drew neither attention nor admiration. Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza, the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of 'idylls'.\\"[70]","field3":"What is the poem ode on a grecian urn about?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"four-year term","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"A term of office is the length of time a person serves in a particular elected office. In many jurisdictions there is a defined limit on how long terms of office may be before the officeholder must be subject to re-election. Some jurisdictions exercise term limits, setting a maximum number of terms an individual may hold in a particular office..\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing the origin of the Westminster system, aspects of the United Kingdom's system of government are replicated in many other countries.\\r\\nThe monarch serves as head of state until his or her death or abdication.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons are elected for the duration of the parliament. Following dissolution of the Parliament, a general election is held which consists of simultaneous elections for all seats. For most MPs this means that their terms of office are identical to the duration of the Parliament, though an individual's term may be cut short by death or resignation. An MP elected in a by-election mid-way through a Parliament, regardless of how long they have occupied the seat, is not exempt from facing re-election at the next general election.\\r\\nThe Septennial Act 1715 provided that a Parliament expired seven years after it had been summoned; this maximum period was reduced to five years by the Parliament Act 1911. Prior to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 parliaments had no minimum duration. Parliaments could be dissolved early by the monarch at the Prime Minister's request. Early dissolutions occurred when the make-up of Parliament made forming government impossible (as occurred in 1974), or, more commonly, when the incumbent government reasoned an early general election would improve their re-election chances (e.g. 2001). The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 mandated that Parliaments should last their full five years. Early dissolution is still possible, but under much more limited circumstances.\\r\\nBecause the government and Prime Minister are effectively indirectly elected through the Commons, the terms of Parliaments and MPs do not directly apply to offices of government, though in practice these are affected by changes in Parliament. While, strictly speaking, a Prime Minister whose incumbency spans multiple Parliaments only serves one, unbroken, term of office, some writers may refer to the different Parliaments as separate terms.[1]\\r\\nHereditary peers and life peers retain membership of the House of Lords for life, though members can resign or be expelled. Lords Spiritual hold membership of the House of Lords until the end of their time as bishops, though a senior bishop may be made a life peer upon the end of their bishopric (e.g. George Carey, made Baron Carey of Clifton the day after he ceased being Archbishop of Canterbury).\\r\\nThe devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are variations on the system of government used at Westminster.\\r\\nThe office of the leader of the devolved administrations has no numeric term limit imposed upon it. However, in the case of the Scottish Government and the Welsh Assembly Government there are fixed terms for which the legislatures can sit. This is imposed at four years. Elections may be held before this time but only if no administration can be formed, which has not happened yet.\\r\\nOffices of local government other regional elected officials follow similar rules to the national offices discussed above, with persons elected to fixed terms of a few years.\\r\\nIn the United States, the president of the United States is elected indirectly through the United States Electoral College to a four-year term, with a term limit of two terms (totaling eight years) or a maximum of ten years if the president acted as president for two years or less in a term where another was elected as president, imposed by the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1951.\\r\\nU.S. Representatives serve two-year terms. U.S. Senators serve six-years terms.\\r\\nFederal judges have different terms in office. Article I judges; such as those that sit on the United States bankruptcy courts, United States Tax Court, and United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and certain other federal courts and other forms of adjudicative bodies serve limited terms: The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for 15 years, bankruptcy courts for 14. However, the majority of the federal judiciary; Article III judges, such as those of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, and federal district courts; serve for life.\\r\\nThe terms of office for officials in state governments varies according to the provisions of state constitutions and state law.\\r\\nThe term for state governors is four years in all states but Vermont and New Hampshire; the Vermont and New Hampshire governors serve for two years.\\r\\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures reported in January 2007 that among state legislatures [1]:\\r\\nAmong territories of the United States:\\r\\nMembers of Council of the District of Columbia serve a four-year term.\\r\\nAs a former British territory following the Westminster System, there are many similarities with the United Kingdom, although with some variations based on local customs, the federal system of government and the absentee monarch.\\r\\nBeing a Commonwealth realm, Canada shares a monarch with the United Kingdom and 14 other countries, who serves as head of state of all 16 realms until their death or abdication.\\r\\nThe Governor General is appointed by the monarch as his/her personal representative on the advice of the Prime Minister, and serves for an indefinite term, though the normal convention is 5 years. Similarly, the Lieutenant Governors, who represent the monarch at the provincial level, are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister (usually also with consultation of the relevant provincial premier), and generally also serve 5 year terms by convention. The territories have Commissioners, who are not representatives of the monarch, but are instead appointed by and represent the Governor-in-Council (i.e. the federal cabinet), and conventionally serve for about 5 years.\\r\\nSimilar to the United Kingdom, MPs serve for the duration of the Parliament. They may resign before the end of a Parliament or be elected in by-elections during the middle of a Parliament.\\r\\nUnder the Constitution Act, 1867, a Parliament may last for a maximum of 5 years from the most recent election before expiring, although all Parliaments to date have been dissolved before they could expire. Bill C-16, introduced in the 39th Parliament, provided for fixed election dates every 4 years on the third Monday in October, beginning in 2009. However, the Prime Minister may still advise the Governor General to dissolve Parliament at any time.\\r\\nAs in the United Kingdom, the cabinet and head of government are indirectly elected based on the composition of the House of Commons, they are not technically affected by the terms of legislators or Parliaments. In practice however, the terms of government office holders are affected by changes in the House of Commons, and those who serve for multiple consecutive Parliaments are generally considered to have served a single term. The term of a government generally ends when it is defeated on a confidence matter or the governing party fails to gain enough seats in a general election.\\r\\nSenators are appointed to the Canadian Senate to represent a province by the Governor General of Canada on the advice of the Prime Minister, and serve until the mandatory retirement age of 75. Senators appointed before the passage of the British North America Act, 1965 served for life. Senators may also resign from office or be expelled from the Senate.\\r\\nProvincial legislatures and the legislature of the Yukon function very similarly to the federal House of Commons. MLAs (called MPPs in Ontario, MNAs in Quebec, and MHAs in Newfoundland and Labrador) serve for the duration of the legislature, though they may resign before the legislature is dissolved or be elected in by-elections between general elections. The legislatures of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut operate using a consensus model, but are similar otherwise. The premiers and their cabinets are selected in the same way as in the House of Commons, and like at the federal level, the term of a provincial government can be ended by defeat in a general election or the loss of the legislature's confidence.\\r\\nAll provincial legislatures except that of Nova Scotia have fixed-term election legislation in place, as does the legislature of the Northwest Territories. Premiers may also advise Lieutenant Governors to dissolve legislatures at any time before the prescribed election date.\\r\\nNumbers in years unless stated otherwise. Note that some countries where fixed-term elections are uncommon, the legislature is almost always dissolved earlier than its expiry date. \\"Until removed from office\\" refers to offices that don't have fixed terms; in these cases, the officeholder(s) may serve indefinitely until death, abdication, resignation, retirement, or forcible removal from office (such as impeachment).\\r\\nIn cases where the head of government is a different person from the head of state, its term of office is identical to the chamber that elected it (the legislature if it is unicameral, or most usually the lower house if it is bicameral), unless it doesn't survive a vote of no confidence.\\r\\n*Excludes senators for life.","field3":"What's the president's term of office?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"a Wilson volleyball","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCast Away is a 2000 American epic survival film directed and co-produced by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, and Nick Searcy. The film depicts a FedEx employee marooned on an uninhabited island after his plane crashes in the South Pacific and his attempts to survive on the island using remnants of his plane's cargo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was released on December 22, 2000. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $429 million worldwide, with Hanks being nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the 73rd Academy Awards.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1995, Chuck Noland is a time-obsessed systems engineer who travels worldwide resolving productivity problems at FedEx depots. He is in a long-term relationship with Kelly Frears, with whom he lives in Memphis, Tennessee. Although the couple wants to get married, Chuck's busy schedule interferes with their relationship. A Christmas with relatives is interrupted when Chuck is summoned to resolve a problem in Malaysia. While flying through a violent storm, his plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Chuck escapes the sinking plane and is saved by an inflatable life raft, but loses the emergency locator transmitter. He clings to the life raft, loses consciousness, and floats all night before washing up on an island. After he awakens, he explores the island and soon discovers that it is uninhabited.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral FedEx packages from the crashed plane also wash up on the shore, as well as the corpse of one of the pilots, which he buries. He initially tries to signal for rescue and makes an escape attempt with the remnants of his life raft, but cannot pass the powerful surf and the coral reefs surrounding the island. He searches for food, water, and shelter, and opens the packages, finding a number of useful items. He leaves one package, which has a pair of angel wings stenciled on it, unopened. During a first attempt to make fire, Chuck receives a deep wound to his hand. In anger and pain, he throws several objects, including a Wilson volleyball from one of the packages. A short time later, he draws a face in the bloody hand print on the ball, names it Wilson, and begins talking to it. One night, Chuck calculates that in order for the rescue workers to find the site of the plane crash, they will have to search an area twice the size of Texas, making him doubtful he will ever be found.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour years later, Chuck has adapted to the islands meager living conditions, having become adept at spearing fish and making fires. He also has regular conversations and arguments with Wilson, his only means of socialization. A large section of a portable toilet washes up on the island; Chuck uses it as a sail in the construction of a raft. After spending some time building and stocking the raft and deciding when weather conditions will be optimal (using an analemma he has created in his cave to monitor the time of year), he launches, using the sail to overcome the powerful surf. After some time on the ocean, a storm nearly tears his raft apart. The following day, as Chuck sleeps, Wilson becomes untethered and floats away from the raft. Chuck is wakened by the spray of a sounding whale, sees Wilson, and swims after him, but Wilson has gone too far to safely retrieve. Chuck returns to the raft and collapses in tears. Later, a passing cargo ship finds him, drifting.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon returning to civilization, Chuck learns that he has long been given up for dead; his family and acquaintances have held a funeral, and Kelly has since married Chuck's onetime dentist and has a daughter. After reuniting, the pair profess their love for each other but, realizing they could not be together because of her commitment to her new family, they sadly part. Kelly gives Chuck the car they once shared.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time later, after buying a new volleyball, Chuck travels to Canadian, Texas, to return the unopened FedEx package with the angel wings to its sender, a woman named Bettina Peterson. No one is home, so he leaves the package at the door with a note saying that the package saved his life. He departs and stops at a remote crossroads. A friendly woman passing by in a pickup truck stops to explain where each road leads. As she drives away, Chuck notices the angel wings on the back of her truck are similar to those on the parcel. As Chuck is left standing at the crossroads he looks down each road, then smiles faintly as he looks in the direction of the woman's truck.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Hanks once stated in an Actor Roundtable with The Hollywood Reporter that \\"...I wanted to examine the concept of four years of hopelessness, in which you have none of the requirements for living  food, water, shelter, fire and company\\". But it took six years to put together the alliance that would actually examine that. [Hanks] only had a third of [the story], and [screenwriter] Bill Broyles only had a third of it, [director] Bob Zemeckis came along and provided that other third. Hanks also went on to say \\"I had that original idea. I was reading an article about FedEx, and I realized that 747s filled with packages fly across the Pacific three times a day. And I just thought, \\"What happens if that goes down?\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film's shooting occurred between 1998 and 2000, but was not shot consecutively. Hanks gained 50 pounds (23?kg) during pre-production, for the purpose of making his transformation more dramatic. After a majority of the film was shot, production was halted for a year so that he could lose the weight and grow his hair and beard to look like he had been living on the island for years. During the year-long hiatus, Zemeckis used the same film crew to make another film, What Lies Beneath.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nCast Away was filmed on Monuriki, one of the Mamanuca Islands in Fiji.[4] It is in a subgroup of the Mamanuca archipelago, which is sited off the coast of Viti Levu, Fiji's largest island. The island became a tourist attraction following the film's release.  After Chuck's return, it is identified by Kelly as being \\"about 600 miles south of the Cook Islands,\\" but there is actually no land between the southernmost Cook Islands of Mangaia and Antarctica.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film essentially begins and ends in the same location, on the Arrington Ranch in the Texas Panhandle south of the city of Canadian, Texas.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film's minimal score was composed by Alan Silvestri for which he won a Grammy Award in 2002. The film's soundtrack is most notable for its lack of score and creature sound effects (such as bird song or insect sounds) while Chuck is on the island, which is intended to reinforce the feeling of isolation.[6] Cast Away contains no original musical score until Chuck escapes the island. However, there is a Russian choral piece heard near the start of the film that was not composed or even recorded by Silvestri, so it does not appear on the film's soundtrack list. It is a traditional Russian song written by Lev Knipper called \\"Oh, My Field\\" (\\"Polyushko, Polye\\") and it is available on various collections of Red Army hymns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official soundtrack CD is an anthology of musical pieces from all films up to that point directed by Zemeckis and scored by Silvestri. The only track from Cast Away itself is the theme from the end credits.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFedEx provided access to their facilities (Memphis, Los Angeles, and Moscow) as well as airplanes, trucks, uniforms, and logistical support. A team of FedEx marketers oversaw production through more than two years of filming.[8] FedEx CEO Fred Smith made an appearance as himself for the scene where Chuck is welcomed back, which was filmed on location at FedEx's home facilities in Memphis, Tennessee. The idea of a story based on a FedEx plane crashing gave the company \\"a heart attack at first,\\" but the overall story was seen as positive. FedEx, which paid no money for product placement in the film,[9] saw an increase in brand awareness in Asia and Europe following the film's release.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the film, Wilson the volleyball serves as Chuck Noland's personified friend and only companion during the four years that Noland spends alone on a deserted island.[11][12][13] Named after the volleyball's manufacturer, Wilson Sporting Goods, the character was created by screenwriter William Broyles, Jr.. While researching for the film, he consulted with professional survival experts, and then chose to deliberately strand himself for one week on an isolated beach in the Gulf of California, to force himself to search for water and food, and obtain his own shelter. During this time, a volleyball washed up on shore. This was the inspiration for the film's inanimate companion. From a screenwriting point of view, Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue in a one-person-only situation.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the original volleyball props was sold at auction for $18,500 to the ex-CEO of FedEx Office, Ken May. At the time of the film's release, Wilson launched its own joint promotion centered on the fact that one of its products was \\"co-starring\\" with Tom Hanks. Wilson manufactured a volleyball with a reproduction of the bloodied handprint face on one side. It was sold for a limited time during the film's initial release and continues to be offered on the company's website.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, Cast Away has an approval rating of 90% based on 154 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Flawed but fascinating, Cast Away offers an intelligent script, some of Robert Zemeckis' most mature directing, and a showcase performance from Tom Hanks.\\"[17] On Metacritic the film has a score of 73 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nCast Away opened in 2,774 theaters in North America and grossed $28,883,406 with an average of $10,412 per theater on its opening weekend.[19] For the four-day Christmas long holiday weekend, it took in a total of $39,852,075.[20] The film kept performing well and ended up earning $233,632,142 domestically and $196,000,000 internationally for a total of $429,632,142, well above its production budget of $90 million.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nA FedEx commercial during the 2003 Super Bowl parodied the final scene of the film, in which Chuck returns a package to its sender. In this version, the woman answers the door, and when Chuck asks what was in the box, the woman replies: \\"Just a satellite phone, GPS locator, fishing rod, water purifier, and some seeds. Just silly stuff.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nMedia executive Lloyd Braun of ABC Studios first suggested the idea of a Cast Awayÿtype television series at a dinner party in 2003.[27] Thom Sherman later pitched the idea for Cast Away ÿ The Series, but never developed the idea.[27] The concept was later developed and pitched with the title Nowhere, which later turned into the ABC show Lost.[27]","field3":"What is wilson in the tom hanks movie castaway?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"American descendants of Presbyterian and other Ulster Protestant Dissenters from various parts of Ireland, but usually from the province of Ulster, who migrated during the 18th and 19th centuries","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Scotch-Irish (or Scots-Irish) Americans are American descendants of Presbyterian and other Ulster Protestant Dissenters from various parts of Ireland, but usually from the province of Ulster, who migrated during the 18th and 19th centuries.[2][3] While an estimated 36 million Americans (12% of the total population) reported Irish ancestry in 2006, and 6 million (2% of the population) reported Scottish ancestry,[4] an additional 5.4 million (1.8% of the population) identified more specifically with Scotch-Irish ancestry. The term Scotch-Irish is used primarily in the United States,[5] with people in Great Britain or Ireland who are of a similar ancestry identifying as Ulster Scots people. Most of these emigres from Ireland had been recent settlers,[citation needed] or the descendants of settlers,[citation needed] from the Kingdom of England or the Kingdom of Scotland who had gone to the Kingdom of Ireland to seek economic opportunities and freedom from the control of the episcopal Church of England and the Scottish Episcopal Church. These included 200,000 Scottish Presbyterians who settled in Ireland between 1608-1697. Many English-born settlers of this period were also Presbyterians, although the denomination is today most strongly identified with Scotland. When King Charles I attempted to force these Presbyterians into the Church of England in the 1630s, many chose to re-emigrate to North America where religious liberty was greater. Later attempts to force the Church of England's control over dissident Protestants in Ireland were to lead to further waves of emigration to the trans-Atlantic colonies.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term is first known to have been used to refer to a people living in Northeastern Ireland. In a letter of April 14, 1573, in reference to Ulster, Elizabeth I of England wrote: \\"We are given to understand that a nobleman named 'Sorley Boy' [MacDonnel] and others, who be of the Scotch-Irish race...\\"[7] This term continued in usage for over a century[8] before the earliest known American reference appeared in a Maryland affidavit in 1689/90.[9]\\r\\nScotch-Irish says Leyburn, \\"is an Americanism, generally unknown in Scotland and Ireland, and rarely used by British historians.\\"[10] It is \\"The more usual term in North America\\" says the Oxford English Dictionary, which gives it a score of 3/8 in terms of current usage. It became common in the United States after 1850.[11] The term is somewhat ambiguous because some of the Scotch-Irish have little or no Scottish ancestry at all: numerous dissenter families had also been transplanted to Ulster from northern England, in particular the border counties of Northumberland and Cumberland. Smaller numbers of migrants also came from Wales and the southeast of England, and others were Protestant religious refugees from Flanders, the German Palatinate, and France (such as the French Huguenot ancestors of Davy Crockett).[12] What united these different national groups was a base of Calvinist religious beliefs,[13] and their separation from the established church (the Church of England and Church of Ireland in this case). That said, the large ethnic Scottish element in the Plantation of Ulster gave the settlements a Scottish character. Upon arrival in North America, these migrants at first usually identified simply as Irish, without the qualifier Scotch. It was not until a century later, following the surge in Irish immigration after the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s, that the descendants of the earlier arrivals began to commonly call themselves Scotch-Irish to distinguish themselves from the newer, predominantly Catholic and poor immigrants; these largely had no Scottish ancestry.[14][15] At first, the two groups had little interaction in America, as the Scots-Irish had become settled decades earlier, primarily in the backcountry of the Appalachian region. The new wave of Catholic Irish settled primarily in port cities such as Boston, New York, Charleston, Chicago, Memphis and New Orleans, where large immigrant communities formed and there were an increasing number of jobs. Many of the new Irish migrants also went to the interior in the 19th century, attracted to jobs on large-scale infrastructure projects such as canals and railroads.[16]\\r\\nThe usage Scots-Irish developed in the late 19th century as a relatively recent version of the term. Two early citations include: 1) \\"a grave, elderly man of the race known in America as \\"Scots-Irish\\" (1870);[17] and 2) \\"Dr. Cochran was of stately presence, of fair and florid complexion, features which testified his Scots-Irish descent\\" (1884)[18] In Ulster-Scots (or \\"Ullans\\"), Scotch-Irish Americans are referred to as the Scotch Airish o' Amerikey.[19]\\r\\nTwentieth-century English author Kingsley Amis endorsed the traditional Scotch-Irish usage implicitly in noting that \\"nobody talks about butterscottish or hopscots,...or Scottish pine\\", and that while Scots or Scottish is how people of Scots origin refer to themselves in Scotland, the traditional English usage Scotch continues to be appropriate in \\"compounds and set phrases\\".[20]\\r\\nThe word \\"Scotch\\" was the favored adjective for things \\"of Scotland\\", including people, until the early 19th century, when it was replaced by the word \\"Scottish\\". It was never properly used as a noun.[citation needed] People in Scotland refer to themselves as Scots, as a noun, or adjectivally/collectively as Scots or Scottish. The use of \\"Scotch\\" as an adjective for anything but whiskey has been out of favor in the U.K. for 200 years[citation needed], but remains in use in the U.S. in place names, names of plants, breeds of dog, a type of tape, etc., and in the term Scotch-Irish.\\r\\nAlthough referenced by Merriam-Webster dictionaries as having first appeared in 1744, the American term Scotch-Irish is undoubtedly older. An affidavit of William Patent, dated March 15, 1689, in a case against a Mr. Matthew Scarbrough in Somerset County, Maryland, quotes Mr. Patent as saying he was told by Scarbrough that \\"... it was no more sin to kill me then to kill a dogg, or any Scotch Irish dogg ...\\"[21]\\r\\nLeyburn cites the following as early American uses of the term before 1744.[22]\\r\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary says the first use of the term Scotch-Irish came in Pennsylvania in 1744:\\r\\nIn Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, historian David Hackett Fischer asserts:\\r\\nSome historians describe these immigrants as \\"Ulster Irish\\" or \\"Northern Irish\\". It is true that many sailed from the province of Ulster ... part of much larger flow which drew from the lowlands of Scotland, the north of England, and every side of the Irish Sea. Many scholars call these people Scotch-Irish. That expression is an Americanism, rarely used in Britain and much resented by the people to whom it was attached.\\r\\nFischer prefers to speak of \\"borderers\\" (referring to the historically war-torn England-Scotland border) as the population ancestral to the \\"backcountry\\" \\"cultural stream\\" (one of the four major and persistent cultural streams from the British Isles which he identifies in American history). He notes the borderers were not purely Celtic but also had substantial Anglo-Saxon and Viking or Scandinavian roots. He described them as quite different from Celtic-speaking groups such as the Scottish Highlanders or Irish (that is, Gaelic-speaking and Roman Catholic).\\r\\nAn example of the use of the term is found in A History of Ulster: \\"Ulster Presbyterians ÿ known as the 'Scotch Irish' ÿ were already accustomed to being on the move, and clearing and defending their land.\\"[23]\\r\\nMany Irish have claimed that such a distinction should not be used, and that those called Scotch-Irish are simply Irish.[5] Other Irish limit the term Irish to those of native Gaelic stock, and prefer to describe the Ulster Protestants as British (a description many Ulster Protestants have preferred themselves to Irish, at least since the Irish Free State broke free from the United Kingdom, although Ulstermen has been adopted in order to maintain a distinction from the native Irish Gaels while retaining a claim to the North of Ireland).[24][25] However, as one scholar observed in 1944, \\"... in this country [USA], where they have been called Scotch-Irish for over two hundred years, it would be absurd to give them a name by which they are not known here. ... Here their name is Scotch-Irish; let us call them by it.\\"[26]\\r\\nFrom 1710 to 1775, over 200,000 people emigrated from Ulster to the original thirteen American colonies. The largest numbers went to Pennsylvania. From that base some went south into Virginia, the Carolinas and across the South, with a large concentration in the Appalachian region. Others headed west to western Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and the Midwest.[27]\\r\\nTransatlantic flows were halted by the American Revolution, but resumed after 1783, with total of 100,000 arriving in America between 1783 and 1812. By that point few were young servants and more were mature craftsmen, and they settled in industrial centers, including Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and New York, where many became skilled workers, foremen and entrepreneurs as the Industrial Revolution took off in the U.S.[citation needed] Another half million came to America 1815 to 1845; another 900,000 came in 1851-99.[citation needed] That religion decisively shaped Scotch-Irish culture.[28]\\r\\nAccording to the Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, there were 400,000 U.S. residents of Irish birth or ancestry in 1790 and half of this group was descended from Ulster, and half from the other three provinces of Ireland.[29]\\r\\nA separate migration brought many to Canada, where they are most numerous in rural Ontario and Nova Scotia.\\r\\nBecause of the proximity of the islands of Britain and Ireland, migrations in both directions had been occurring since Ireland was first settled after the retreat of the ice sheets. Gaels from Ireland colonised current southwestern Scotland as part of the Kingdom of Dl Riata, eventually replacing the native Pictish culture throughout Scotland.[citation needed] The Irish Gaels had previously been named Scoti by the Romans, and eventually their name was applied to the entire Kingdom of Scotland.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe origins of the Scotch-Irish lie primarily in the Lowlands of Scotland and in northern England, particularly in the Border Country on either side of the Anglo-Scottish border, a region that had seen centuries of conflict.[30] In the near constant state of war between England and Scotland during the Middle Ages, the livelihood of the people on the borders was devastated by the contending armies. Even when the countries were not at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in one or the other kingdom was often weak. The uncertainty of existence led the people of the borders to seek security through a system of family ties, similar to the clan system in the Scottish Highlands. Known as the Border Reivers, these families relied on their own strength and cunning to survive, and a culture of cattle raiding and thievery developed.[31]\\r\\nScotland and England became unified under a single monarch with the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when James VI, King of Scots, succeeded Elizabeth I as ruler of England. In addition to the unstable border region, James also inherited Elizabeth's conflicts in Ireland. Following the end of the Irish Nine Years' War in 1603, and the Flight of the Earls in 1607, James embarked in 1609 on a systematic plantation of English and Scottish Protestant settlers to Ireland's northern province of Ulster.[32] The Plantation of Ulster was seen as a way to relocate the Border Reiver families to Ireland to bring peace to the Anglo-Scottish border country, and also to provide fighting men who could suppress the native Irish in Ireland.[33]\\r\\nThe first major influx of Scots and English into Ulster had come in 1606 during the settlement of east Down onto land cleared of native Irish by private landlords chartered by James.[34] This process was accelerated with James's official plantation in 1609, and further augmented during the subsequent Irish Confederate Wars. The first of the Stuart Kingdoms to collapse into civil war was Ireland where, prompted in part by the anti-Catholic rhetoric of the Covenanters, Irish Catholics launched a rebellion in October. In reaction to the proposal by Charles I and Thomas Wentworth to raise an army manned by Irish Catholics to put down the Covenanter movement in Scotland, the Parliament of Scotland had threatened to invade Ireland in order to achieve \\"the extirpation of Popery out of Ireland\\" (according to the interpretation of Richard Bellings, a leading Irish politician of the time). The fear this caused in Ireland unleashed a wave of massacres against Protestant English and Scottish settlers, mostly in Ulster, once the rebellion had broken out. All sides displayed extreme cruelty in this phase of the war. Around 4000 settlers were massacred and a further 12,000 may have died of privation after being driven from their homes. The number of native Irish that died as a result of the Scottish colonisation is over 1,000,000, other estimations are higher. This caused Ireland's population, combined with the Irish catholic refugees fleeing to drop by 25%. [35] William Petty's figure of 37,000 Protestants massacred... is far too high, perhaps by a factor of ten, certainly more recent research suggests that a much more realistic figure is roughly 4,000 deaths.[36] In one notorious incident, the Protestant inhabitants of Portadown were taken captive and then massacred on the bridge in the town.[37] The settlers responded in kind, as did the British-controlled government in Dublin, with attacks on the Irish civilian population. Massacres of native civilians occurred at Rathlin Island and elsewhere.[38] In early 1642, the Covenanters sent an army to Ulster to defend the Scottish settlers there from the Irish rebels who had attacked them after the outbreak of the rebellion. The original intention of the Scottish army was to re-conquer Ireland, but due to logistical and supply problems, it was never in a position to advance far beyond its base in eastern Ulster. The Covenanter force remained in Ireland until the end of the civil wars but was confined to its garrison around Carrickfergus after its defeat by the native Ulster Army at the Battle of Benburb in 1646. After the war was over, many of the soldiers settled permanently in Ulster. Another major influx of Scots into Ulster occurred in the 1690s, when tens of thousands of people fled a famine in Scotland to come to Ireland.\\r\\nA few generations after arriving in Ireland, considerable numbers of Ulster-Scots emigrated to the North American colonies of Great Britain throughout the 18th century (between 1717 and 1770 alone, about 250,000 settled in what would become the United States).[39] According to Kerby Miller, Emigrants and Exiles: Ireland and the Irish Exodus to North America (1988), Protestants were one-third the population of Ireland, but three-quarters of all emigrants leaving from 1700 to 1776; 70% of these Protestants were Presbyterians. Other factors contributing to the mass exodus of Ulster Scots to America during the 18th century were a series of droughts and rising rents imposed by often absentee English and/or Anglo-Irish landlords.\\r\\nDuring the course of the 17th century, the number of settlers belonging to Calvinist dissenting sects, including Scottish and Northumbrian Presbyterians, English Baptists, French and Flemish Huguenots, and German Palatines, became the majority among the Protestant settlers in the province of Ulster. However, the Presbyterians and other dissenters, along with Catholics, were not members of the established church and were consequently legally disadvantaged by the Penal Laws, which gave full rights only to members of the Church of England/Church of Ireland. Those members of the state church were often absentee landlords and the descendants of the British aristocracy who had been given land by the monarchy. For this reason, up until the 19th century, and despite their common fear of the dispossessed Catholic native Irish, there was considerable disharmony between the Presbyterians and the Protestant Ascendancy in Ulster. As a result of this many Ulster-Scots, along with Catholic native Irish, ignored religious differences to join the United Irishmen and participate in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, in support of Age of Enlightenment-inspired egalitarian and republican goals.\\r\\nScholarly estimate is that over 200,000 Scotch-Irish migrated to the Americas between 1717 and 1775.[40] As a late arriving group, they found that land in the coastal areas of the British colonies was either already owned or too expensive, so they quickly left for the more mountainous interior where land could be obtained cheaply. Here they lived on the first frontier of America. Early frontier life was extremely challenging, but poverty and hardship were familiar to them. The term hillbilly has often been applied to their descendants in the mountains, carrying connotations of poverty, backwardness and violence; this word has its origins in Scotland and Ireland.\\r\\nThe first trickle of Scotch-Irish settlers arrived in New England. Valued for their fighting prowess as well as for their Protestant dogma, they were invited by Cotton Mather and other leaders to come over to help settle and secure the frontier. In this capacity, many of the first permanent settlements in Maine and New Hampshire, especially after 1718, were Scotch-Irish and many place names as well as the character of Northern New Englanders reflect this fact. The Scotch-Irish brought the potato with them from Ireland (although the potato originated in South America, it was not known in North America until brought over from Europe). In Maine it became a staple crop as well as an economic base.[41]\\r\\nFrom 1717 to the next thirty or so years, the primary points of entry for the Ulster immigrants were Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and New Castle, Delaware.[citation needed] The Scotch-Irish radiated westward across the Alleghenies, as well as into Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee.[42] The typical migration involved small networks of related families who settled together, worshipped together, and intermarried, avoiding outsiders.[43]\\r\\nMost Scotch-Irish headed for Pennsylvania, with its good lands, moderate climate, and liberal laws.[citation needed] By 1750, the Scotch-Irish were about a fourth of the population, rising to about a third by the 1770s.[citation needed] Without much cash, they moved to free lands on the frontier, becoming the typical western \\"squatters\\", the frontier guard of the colony, and what the historian Frederick Jackson Turner described as \\"the cutting-edge of the frontier\\".[44]\\r\\nThe Scotch-Irish moved up the Delaware River to Bucks County, and then up the Susquehanna and Cumberland valleys, finding flat lands along the rivers and creeks to set up their log cabins, their grist mills, and their Presbyterian churches.[citation needed] Chester, Lancaster, and Dauphin counties became their strongholds, and they built towns such as Chambersburg, Gettysburg, Carlisle, and York; the next generation moved into western Pennsylvania.[45] With large numbers of children who needed their own inexpensive farms, the Scotch-Irish avoided areas already settled by Germans and Quakers and moved south, through the Shenandoah Valley, and through the Blue Ridge Mountains into Virginia.[citation needed] These migrants followed the Great Wagon Road from Lancaster, through Gettysburg, and down through Staunton, Virginia, to Big Lick (now Roanoke), Virginia. Here the pathway split, with the Wilderness Road taking settlers west into Tennessee and Kentucky, while the main road continued south into the Carolinas.[46][47]\\r\\nBecause the Scotch-Irish settled the frontier of Pennsylvania and western Virginia, they were in the midst of the French and Indian War and Pontiac's Rebellion that followed.[48] The Scotch-Irish were frequently in conflict with the Indian tribes who lived on the other side of the frontier; indeed, they did most of the Indian fighting on the American frontier from New Hampshire to the Carolinas.[49][50] The Irish and Scots also became the middlemen who handled trade and negotiations between the Indian tribes and the colonial governments.[51]\\r\\nEspecially in Pennsylvania, whose pacifist Quaker leaders had made no provision for a militia, Scotch-Irish settlements were frequently destroyed and the settlers killed, captured or forced to flee after attacks by Native Americans from tribes of the Delaware (Lenape), Shawnee, Seneca, and others of western Pennsylvania and the Ohio country.[citation needed] Indian attacks were taking place within 60 miles of Philadelphia, and in July 1763, the Pennsylvania Assembly authorized a 700-strong militia to be raised, to be used only for defensive actions. Formed into two units of rangers, the Cumberland Boys and the Paxton Boys, the militia soon exceeded their defensive mandate and began offensive forays against Lenape villages in western Pennsylvania.[52] After attacking Delaware villages in the upper Susquehanna valley, the militia leaders received information, which they believed credible, that \\"hostile\\" tribes were receiving weapons and ammunition from the \\"friendly\\" tribe of Conestogas settled in Lancaster County, who were under the protection of the Pennsylvania Assembly. On 14 December 1763, about fifty Paxton Boys rode to Conestogatown, near Millersville, PA, and murdered six Conestogas. Governor John Penn placed the remaining fourteen Conestogas in protective custody in the Lancaster workhouse, but the Paxton Boys broke in, killing and mutilating all fourteen on 27 December 1763.[53] Following this, about 400 backcountry settlers, primarily Scotch-Irish, marched on Philadelphia demanding better military protection for their settlements, and pardons for the Paxton Boys. Benjamin Franklin led the politicians who negotiated a settlement with the Paxton leaders, after which they returned home.[54]\\r\\nThe United States Declaration of Independence contained 56 delegate signatures. Of the signers, eight were of Irish descent.[citation needed] Two signers, George Taylor and James Smith, were born in Ulster. The remaining five Irish-Americans, George Read, Thomas McKean, Thomas Lynch, Jr., Edward Rutledge and Charles Carroll, were the sons or grandsons of Irish immigrants, and at least McKean had Ulster heritage.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Scotch-Irish were generally ardent supporters of American independence from Britain in the 1770s. In Pennsylvania, Virginia, and most of the Carolinas, support for the revolution was \\"practically unanimous\\".[46] One Hessian officer said, \\"Call this war by whatever name you may, only call it not an American rebellion; it is nothing more or less than a Scotch Irish Presbyterian rebellion.\\"[46] A British major general testified to the House of Commons that \\"half the rebel Continental Army were from Ireland\\".[55] Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, with its large Scotch-Irish population, was to make the first declaration for independence from Britain in the Mecklenburg Declaration of 1775.[disputed ÿ discuss]\\r\\nThe Scotch-Irish \\"Overmountain Men\\" of Virginia and North Carolina formed a militia which won the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780, resulting in the British abandonment of a southern campaign, and for some historians \\"marked the turning point of the American Revolution\\".[56][57]\\r\\nOne exception to the high level of patriotism was the Waxhaw settlement on the lower Catawba River along the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary, where Loyalism was strong. The area experienced two main settlement periods of Scotch-Irish. During the 1750sÿ1760s, second- and third-generation Scotch-Irish Americans moved from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina. This particular group had large families, and as a group they produced goods for themselves and for others. They generally were Patriots.\\r\\nJust prior to the Revolution, a second stream of immigrants came directly from Ireland via Charleston. This group was forced to move into an underdeveloped area because they could not afford expensive land. Most of this group remained loyal to the Crown or neutral when the war began. Prior to Charles Cornwallis's march into the backcountry in 1780, two-thirds of the men among the Waxhaw settlement had declined to serve in the army. The British massacre of American prisoners at the Battle of Waxhaws resulted in anti-British sentiment in a bitterly divided region. While many individuals chose to take up arms against the British, the British themselves forced the people to choose sides.[58]\\r\\nIn the 1790s, the new American government assumed the debts the individual states had amassed during the American Revolutionary War, and the Congress placed a tax on whiskey (among other things) to help repay those debts. Large producers were assessed a tax of six cents a gallon. Smaller producers, many of whom were Scottish (often Scotch-Irish) descent and located in the more remote areas, were taxed at a higher rate of nine cents a gallon. These rural settlers were short of cash to begin with, and lacked any practical means to get their grain to market, other than fermenting and distilling it into relatively portable spirits. From Pennsylvania to Georgia, the western counties engaged in a campaign of harassment of the federal tax collectors. \\"Whiskey Boys\\" also conducted violent protests in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, and Georgia. This civil disobedience eventually culminated in armed conflict in the Whiskey Rebellion. President George Washington marched at the head of 13,000 soldiers to suppress the insurrection.\\r\\nAuthor (and U.S. Senator) Jim Webb puts forth a thesis in his book Born Fighting (2004) to suggest that the character traits he ascribes to the Scotch-Irish such as loyalty to kin, extreme mistrust of governmental authority and legal strictures, and a propensity to bear arms and to use them, helped shape the American identity. In the same year that Webb's book was released, Barry A. Vann published his second book, entitled Rediscovering the South's Celtic Heritage. Like his earlier book, From Whence They Came (1998), Vann argues that these traits have left their imprint on the Upland South. In 2008, Vann followed up his earlier work with a book entitled In Search of Ulster Scots Land: The Birth and Geotheological Imagings of a Transatlantic People, which professes how these traits may manifest themselves in conservative voting patterns and religious affiliation that characterizes the Bible Belt.\\r\\nThe iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Ingham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \\"largely Scotch-Irish\\". Ingham finds that the Scotch-Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \\"developed their own sense of uniqueness\\".[59]\\r\\nNew immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster; 1813ÿ1908) left Ireland in 1823 and became the founder of the famous Mellon clan, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James H. Laughlin (b. Ulster; 1806ÿ1882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company constituted the \\"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society\\".[60]\\r\\nArcheologists and folklorists have examined the folk culture of the Scotch-Irish in terms of material goodssuch as housingas well as speech patterns and folk songs. Much of the research has been done in Appalachia.[61]\\r\\nThe border origin of the Scotch-Irish is supported by study of the traditional music and folklore of the Appalachian Mountains, settled primarily by the Scotch-Irish in the 18th century. Musicologist Cecil Sharp collected hundreds of folk songs in the region, and observed that the musical tradition of the people \\"seems to point to the North of England, or to the Lowlands, rather than the Highlands, of Scotland, as the country from which they originally migrated. For the Appalachian tunes...have far more affinity with the normal English folk-tune than with that of the Gaelic-speaking Highlander.\\"[62] Similarly, elements of mountain folklore trace back to events in the Lowlands of Scotland. As an example, it was recorded in the early 20th century that Appalachian children were frequently warned, \\"You must be good or Clavers will get you.\\" To the mountain residents, \\"Clavers\\" was simply a bogeyman used to keep children in line, yet unknown to them the phrase derives from the 17th century Scotsman John Graham of Claverhouse, called \\"Bloody Clavers\\" by the Presbyterian Scottish Lowlanders whose religion he tried to suppress.[63]\\r\\nIn terms of the stone houses they built, the \\"hall-parlor\\" floor plan (two rooms per floor with chimneys on both ends) was common among the gentry in Ulster. Scotch-Irish immigrants brought it over in the 18th century and it became a common floor plan in Tennessee, Kentucky, and elsewhere. Stone houses were difficult to build, and most pioneers relied on simpler log cabins.[64]\\r\\nScotch-Irish quilters in West Virginia developed a unique interpretation of pieced-block quilt construction. Their quilts embody an aesthetic reflecting Scotch-Irish social historythe perennial condition of living on the periphery of mainstream society both geographically and philosophically. Cultural values espousing individual autonomy and self-reliance within a strong kinship structure are related to Scotch-Irish quilting techniques. Prominent features of these quilts include: 1) blocks pieced in a repeating pattern but varied by changing figure-ground relationships and, at times, obscured by the use of same-value colors and adjacent print fabrics, 2) lack of contrasting borders, and 3) a unified all-over quilting pattern, typically the \\"fans\\" design or rows of concentric arcs.[65]\\r\\nMontgomery (2006) analyzes the pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammatical distinctions of today's residents of the mountain South and traces patterns back to their Scotch-Irish ancestors.[66] However, Crozier (1984) suggests that only a few lexical characteristics survived Scotch-Irish assimilation into American culture.[67]\\r\\nAccording to The Source: A Guidebook of American Genealogy, by Kory L. Meyerink and Loretto Dennis Szucs, the following were the countries of origin for new arrivals coming to the United States before 1790. The regions marked * were part of, or ruled by, the Kingdom of Great Britain. (The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after 1801) The ancestry of the 3,929,326 million population in 1790 has been estimated by various sources by sampling last names in the 1790 census and assigning them a country of origin. According to the Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups (Thernstrom, S 1980, 'Irish,' p.?528), there were 400,000 Americans of Irish birth or ancestry in 1790; half of these were descended from Ulster, and half were descended from other provinces in Ireland. The French were mostly Huguenots and French Canadians. although only 17% of all Americans had any religious affiliation.The Indian population inside territorial U.S. 1790 boundaries was less than 100,000.[citation needed]\\r\\nFinding the coast already heavily settled, most groups of settlers from the north of Ireland moved into the \\"western mountains\\", where they populated the Appalachian regions and the Ohio Valley. Others settled in northern New England, The Carolinas, Georgia and north-central Nova Scotia.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the United States Census, 2000, 4.3 million Americans (1.5% of the U.S. population) claimed Scotch-Irish ancestry.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe author Jim Webb suggests that the true number of people with some Scotch-Irish heritage in the United States is in the region of 27 million.[71]\\r\\nThe states with the most Scotch-Irish populations:[72]\\r\\nThe states with the top percentages of Scotch-Irish:\\r\\nInitially the Scotch-Irish immigrants to North America in the 18th century were defined in part by their Presbyterianism.[73] Many of the settlers in the Plantation of Ulster had been from dissenting/non-conformist religious groups which professed a strident[citation needed] Calvinism. These included mainly Lowland Scot Presbyterians, but also English Puritans and Quakers, French Huguenots and German Palatines. These Calvinist groups mingled freely in church matters, and religious belief was more important than nationality, as these groups aligned themselves against both their Catholic Irish and Anglican English neighbors.[74]\\r\\nAfter their arrival in the New World, the predominantly Presbyterian Scotch-Irish began to move further into the mountainous back-country of Virginia and the Carolinas. The establishment of many settlements in the remote back-country put a strain on the ability of the Presbyterian Church to meet the new demand for qualified, college-educated clergy. Religious groups such as the Baptists and Methodists had no higher education requirement for their clergy to be ordained, and these groups readily provided ministers to meet the demand of the growing Scotch-Irish settlements.[75] By about 1810, Baptist and Methodist churches were in the majority, and the descendants of the Scotch-Irish today remain predominantly Baptist or Methodist.[76] Vann (2007) shows the Scotch-Irish played a major role in defining the Bible Belt in the Upper South in the 18th century. He emphasizes the high educational standards they sought, their \\"geotheological thought worlds\\" brought from the old country, and their political independence that was transferred to frontier religion.[77]\\r\\nIn 1746 the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians created the College of New Jersey, later renamed Princeton University. The mission was training New Light Presbyterian ministers. The college became educational as well as religious capital of Scotch-Irish America. By 1808 loss of confidence in the college within the Presbyterian Church led to the establishment of the separate Princeton Theological Seminary, but for many decades Presbyterian control over the college continued. Meanwhile, Princeton Seminary, under the leadership of Charles Hodge, originated a conservative theology that in large part shaped Fundamentalist Protestantism in the 20th century.[78]\\r\\nWhile the larger Presbyterian Church was a mix of Scotch Irish and Yankees from New England, several smaller Presbyterian groups were composed almost entirely of Scotch Irish, and they display the process of assimilation into the broader American religious culture. Fisk (1968) traces the history of the Associate Reformed Church in the Old Northwest from its formation by a union of Associate and Reformed Presbyterians in 1782 to the merger of this body with the Seceder Scotch Irish bodies to form the United Presbyterian Church in 1858. It became the Associate Reformed Synod of the West and remain centered in the Midwest. It withdrew from the parent body in 1820 because of the drift of the eastern churches toward assimilation into the larger Presbyterian Church with its Yankee traits. The Associate Reformed Synod of the West maintained the characteristics of an immigrant church with Scotch-Irish roots, emphasized the Westminster standards, used only the psalms in public worship, was Sabbatarian, and was strongly abolitionist and anti-Catholic. In the 1850s it exhibited many evidences of assimilation. It showed greater ecumenical interest, greater interest in evangelization of the West and of the cities, and a declining interest in maintaining the unique characteristics of its Scotch-Irish past.[79]\\r\\nMany American presidents have ancestral links to Ulster, including three whose parents were born in Ulster.[80] The Irish Protestant vote in the U.S. has not been studied nearly as much as that of the Catholic Irish. In the 1820s and 1830s, supporters of Andrew Jackson emphasized his Irish background, as did James Knox Polk, but since the 1840s it has been uncommon for a Protestant politician in America to be identified as Irish, but rather as 'Scotch-Irish'.[original research?] In Canada, by contrast, Irish Protestants remained a cohesive political force well into the 20th century, identified with the then Conservative Party of Canada and especially with the Orange Institution, although this is less evident in today's politics.\\r\\nMore than one-third of all U.S. Presidents had substantial ancestral origins in the northern province of Ireland (Ulster). President Bill Clinton spoke proudly of that fact, and his own ancestral links with the province, during his two visits to Ulster. Like most US citizens, most US presidents are the result of a \\"melting pot\\" of ancestral origins.\\r\\nClinton is one of at least seventeen Chief Executives descended from emigrants to the United States from Ulster. While many of the Presidents have typically Ulster-Scots surnames ÿ Jackson, Johnson, McKinley, Wilson ÿ others, such as Roosevelt and Cleveland, have links which are less obvious.\\r\\n2 Russia is a transcontinental country in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia.

The story is set against a backdrop of tumultuous events, from the fall of Afghanistan's monarchy through the Soviet military intervention, the exodus of refugees to Pakistan and the United States, and the rise of the Taliban regime.\\r\\nHosseini has commented that he considers The Kite Runner to be a fatherÿson story, emphasizing the familial aspects of the narrative, an element that he continued to use in his later works.[2] Themes of guilt and redemption feature prominently in the novel,[3] with a pivotal scene depicting an act of violence against Hassan that Amir fails to prevent. The latter half of the book centers on Amir's attempts to atone for this transgression by rescuing Hassan's son over two decades later.\\r\\nThe Kite Runner became a bestseller after being printed in paperback and was popularized in book clubs. It was a number one New York Times bestseller for over two years,[4] with over seven million copies sold in the United States.[5] Reviews were generally positive, though parts of the plot drew significant controversy in Afghanistan[citation needed]. A number of adaptations were created following publication, including a 2007 film of the same name, several stage performances, and a graphic novel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKhaled Hosseini worked as a medical internist at Kaiser Hospital in Mountain View, California for several years before publishing The Kite Runner.[3][6][7] In 1999, Hosseini learned through a news report that the Taliban had banned kite flying in Afghanistan,[8] a restriction he found particularly cruel.[9] The news \\"struck a personal chord\\" for him, as he had grown up with the sport while living in Afghanistan. He was motivated to write a 25-page short story about two boys who fly kites in Kabul.[8] Hosseini submitted copies to Esquire and The New Yorker, both of which rejected it.[9] He rediscovered the manuscript in his garage in March 2001 and began to expand it to novel format at the suggestion of a friend.[8][9] According to Hosseini, the narrative became \\"much darker\\" than he originally intended.[8] His editor, Cindy Spiegel, \\"helped him rework the last third of his manuscript\\", something she describes as relatively common for a first novel.[9]\\r\\nAs with Hosseini's subsequent novels, The Kite Runner covers a multigenerational period and focuses on the relationship between parents and their children.[2] The latter was unintentional; Hosseini developed an interest in the theme while in the process of writing.[2] He later divulged that he frequently came up with pieces of the plot by drawing pictures of it.[7] For example, he did not decide to make Amir and Hassan brothers until after he had \\"doodled it\\".[7]\\r\\nLike Amir, the protagonist of the novel, Hosseini was born in Afghanistan and left the country as a youth, not returning until 2003.[10] Thus, he was frequently questioned about the extent of the autobiographical aspects of the book.[9] In response, he said, \\"When I say some of it is me, then people look unsatisfied. The parallels are pretty obvious, but?... I left a few things ambiguous because I wanted to drive the book clubs crazy.\\"[9] Having left the country around the time of the Soviet invasion, he felt a certain amount of survivor's guilt: \\"Whenever I read stories about Afghanistan my reaction was always tinged with guilt. A lot of my childhood friends had a very hard time. Some of our cousins died. One died in a fuel truck trying to escape Afghanistan [an incident that Hosseini fictionalises in The Kite Runner]. Talk about guilt. He was one of the kids I grew up with flying kites. His father was shot.\\"[2][11] Regardless, he maintains that the plot is fictional.[8] Later, when writing his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (then titled Dreaming in Titanic City), Hosseini remarked that he was happy that the main characters were women as it \\"should put the end to the autobiographical question once and for all\\".[9]\\r\\nRiverhead Books published The Kite Runner, ordering an initial printing of 50,000 copies in hardback.[9][12] It was released on May 29, 2003, and the paperback edition was released a year later.[9][13] Hosseini took a year-long absence from practicing medicine to promote the book, signing copies, speaking at various events, and raising funds for Afghan causes.[9] Originally published in English, The Kite Runner was later translated into 42 languages for publication in 38 countries.[14] In 2013, Riverhead released the 10th anniversary edition with a new gold-rimmed cover and a foreword by Hosseini.[15] That same year, on May 21, Khaled Hosseini published another book called And the Mountains Echoed.\\r\\nAmir, a well-to-do Pashtun boy, and Hassan, a Hazara who is the son of Ali, Amir's father's servant, spend their days kite fighting in the hitherto peaceful city of Kabul. Hassan is a successful \\"kite runner\\" for Amir; he knows where the kite will land without watching it. Amir's father, a wealthy merchant Amir affectionately refers to as Baba, loves both boys, but is often critical of Amir, considering him weak and lacking in courage. Amir finds a kinder fatherly figure in Rahim Khan, Baba's closest friend, who understands him and supports his interest in writing, whereas Baba considers that interest to be worthy only of females.\\r\\nAssef, an older boy with a sadistic taste for violence, mocks Amir for socializing with a Hazara, which is, according to Assef, an inferior race whose members belong only in Hazarajat. One day, he prepares to attack Amir with brass knuckles, but Hassan defends Amir, threatening to shoot out Assef's eye with his slingshot. Assef backs off but swears to get revenge.\\r\\nOne triumphant day, Amir wins the local kite fighting tournament and finally earns Baba's praise. Hassan runs for the last cut kite, a great trophy, saying to Amir, \\"For you, a thousand times over.\\" However, after finding the kite, Hassan encounters Assef in an alleyway. Hassan refuses to give up the kite, and Assef severely beats him and rapes him. Amir witnesses the act but is too scared to intervene. He knows that if he fails to bring home the kite, Baba would be less proud of him. He feels incredibly guilty but knows his cowardice would destroy any hopes for Baba's affections, so he keeps quiet about the incident. Afterwards, Amir keeps distant from Hassan; his feelings of guilt prevent him from interacting with the boy.\\r\\nAmir begins to believe that life would be easier if Hassan were not around, so he plants a watch and some money under Hassan's mattress in hopes that Baba will make him leave; Hassan falsely confesses when confronted by Baba. Although Baba believes \\"there is no act more wretched than stealing\\", he forgives him. To Baba's sorrow, Hassan and Ali leave anyway. Amir is freed of the daily reminder of his cowardice and betrayal, but he still lives in their shadow.\\r\\nIn 1979, five years later, the Soviet Union militarily intervenes in Afghanistan. Amir and Baba escape to Peshawar, Pakistan, and then to Fremont, California, where they settle in a run-down apartment. Baba begins work at a gas station. After graduating from high school, Amir takes classes at San Jose State University to develop his writing skills. Every Sunday, Baba and Amir make extra money selling used goods at a flea market in San Jose. There, Amir meets fellow refugee Soraya Taheri and her family. Baba is diagnosed with terminal cancer but is still capable of granting Amir one last favor: he asks Soraya's father's permission for Amir to marry her. He agrees and the two marry. Shortly thereafter Baba dies. Amir and Soraya settle down in a happy marriage, but to their sorrow they learn that they cannot have children.\\r\\nAmir embarks on a successful career as a novelist. Fifteen years after his wedding, Amir receives a call from his father's best friend (and his childhood father figure) Rahim Khan, who is dying, asking him to come see him in Peshawar. He enigmatically tells Amir, \\"There is a way to be good again.\\" Now enticed, Amir goes.\\r\\nFrom Rahim Khan, Amir learns that Ali was killed by a land mine and that Hassan and his wife were killed after Hassan refused to allow the Taliban to confiscate Baba and Amir's house in Kabul. Rahim Khan further reveals that Ali, being sterile, was not Hassan's biological father. Hassan was actually Baba's son and Amir's half-brother. Finally, he tells Amir that the reason he called Amir to Pakistan was to rescue Sohrab, Hassan's son, from an orphanage in Kabul.\\r\\nAmir, accompanied by Farid, an Afghan taxi driver and veteran of the war with the Soviets, searches for Sohrab. They learn that a Taliban official comes to the orphanage often, brings cash, and usually takes a girl away with him. Occasionally he chooses a boy, recently Sohrab. The director tells Amir how to find the official, and Farid secures an appointment at his home by claiming to have \\"personal business\\" with him.\\r\\nAmir meets the man, who reveals himself as Assef. Sohrab is being kept at Assef's house. Assef agrees to relinquish him if Amir can beat him in a fight. Assef then badly beats Amir, breaking several bones, until Sohrab uses a slingshot to fire a brass ball into Assef's left eye. Sohrab helps Amir out of the house, where he passes out and wakes up in a hospital.\\r\\nAmir tells Sohrab of his plans to take him back to America and possibly adopt him. However, American authorities demand evidence of Sohrab's orphan status. Amir tells Sohrab that he may have to go back to the orphanage for a little while as they encounter a problem in the adoption process, and Sohrab, terrified about returning to the orphanage, attempts suicide. Amir eventually manages to take him back to the United States. After his adoption, Sohrab refuses to interact with Amir or Soraya until the former reminisces about Hassan and kites and shows off some of Hassan's tricks. In the end, Sohrab only gives a lopsided smile, but Amir takes it with all his heart as he runs the kite for Sohrab, saying, \\"For you, a thousand times over.\\"\\r\\nBecause its themes of friendship, betrayal, guilt, redemption and the uneasy love between fathers and sons are universal, and not specifically Afghan, the book has been able to reach across cultural, racial, religious and gender gaps to resonate with readers of varying backgrounds.\\r\\nKhaled Hosseini identifies a number of themes that appear in The Kite Runner, but reviewers have focused on guilt and redemption.[9][11][19] As a child, Amir fails to save Hassan in an act of cowardice and afterwards suffers from an all-consuming guilt. Even after leaving the country, moving to America, marrying, and becoming a successful writer, he is unable to forget the incident. Hassan is \\"the all-sacrificing Christ-figure, the one who, even in death, calls Amir to redemption\\".[19] Following Hassan's death at the hands of the Taliban, Amir begins to redeem himself through the rescue of Hassan's son, Sohrab.[20] Hosseini draws parallels during the search for Sohrab to create an impression of poetic justice; for example, Amir sustains a split lip after being severely beaten, similar to Hassan's harelip.[20] Despite this, some critics questioned whether the protagonist had fully redeemed himself.[21]\\r\\nAmir's motivation for the childhood betrayal is rooted in his insecurities regarding his relationship with his father.[22] The relationship between parents and their children features prominently in the novel, and in an interview, Hosseini elaborated:\\r\\nBoth [The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns] are multigenerational, and so the relationship between parent and child, with all of its manifest complexities and contradictions, is a prominent theme. I did not intend this, but I am keenly interested, it appears, in the way parents and children love, disappoint, and in the end honor each other. In one way, the two novels are corollaries: The Kite Runner was a father-son story, and A Thousand Splendid Suns can be seen as a mother-daughter story.[2]\\r\\nWhen adapting The Kite Runner for the theatre, Director Eric Rose stated that he was drawn into the narrative by the \\"themes of betraying your best friend for the love of your father\\", which he compared to Shakespearean literature.[23] Throughout the story, Amir craves his father's affection;[22] his father, in turn, loves Amir but favors Hassan,[20] going as far as to pay for plastic surgery to repair the latter's cleft lip.[24]\\r\\nIn the first two years following its publication, over 70,000 hardback copies of The Kite Runner were sold along with 1,250,000 paperback copies.[3] Though the book sold well in hardback, \\"Kite Runner's popularity didn't really begin to soar until [2004] when the paperback edition came out, which is when book clubs began picking it up.\\"[9] It started appearing on best seller lists in September 2004 and became a number one New York Times best seller in March 2005,[3] maintaining its place on the list for two years.[4] By the publication of Khaled Hosseini's third novel in 2013, over seven million copies had been sold in the United States.[5] The book received the South African Boeke Prize in 2004. It was voted the Reading Group Book of the Year for 2006 and 2007 and headed a list of 60 titles submitted by entrants to the Penguin/Orange Reading Group prize (UK).[26][27]\\r\\nCritically, the book was well-received, albeit controversial. Erika Milvy from Salon praised it as \\"beautifully written, startling and heart wrenching\\".[28] Tony Sims from Wired Magazine wrote that the book \\"reveals the beauty and agony of a tormented nation as it tells the story of an improbable friendship between two boys from opposite ends of society, and of the troubled but enduring relationship between a father and a son\\".[29] Amelia Hill of The Guardian opinionated, \\"The Kite Runner is the shattering first novel by Khaled Hosseini\\" that \\"is simultaneously devastating and inspiring.\\"[22] A similarly favorable review was printed in Publishers Weekly.[13] Marketing director Melissa Mytinger remarked, \\"It's simply an excellent story. Much of it based in a world we don't know, a world we're barely beginning to know. Well-written, published at the 'right time' by an author who is both charming and thoughtful in his personal appearances for the book.\\"[3] Indian-American actor Aasif Mandvi agreed that the book was \\"amazing storytelling.?... It's about human beings. It's about redemption, and redemption is a powerful theme.\\"[9] First Lady Laura Bush commended the story as \\"really great\\".[25] Said Tayeb Jawad, the 19th Afghan ambassador to the United States, publicly endorsed The Kite Runner, saying that the book would help the American public to better understand Afghan society and culture.[9]\\r\\nEdward Hower from The New York Times analyzed the portrayal of Afghanistan before and after the Taliban:\\r\\nHosseini's depiction of pre-revolutionary Afghanistan is rich in warmth and humor but also tense with the friction between the nation's different ethnic groups. Amir's father, or Baba, personifies all that is reckless, courageous and arrogant in his dominant Pashtun tribe?... The novel's canvas turns dark when Hosseini describes the suffering of his country under the tyranny of the Taliban, whom Amir encounters when he finally returns home, hoping to help Hassan and his family. The final third of the book is full of haunting images: a man, desperate to feed his children, trying to sell his artificial leg in the market; an adulterous couple stoned to death in a stadium during the halftime of a football match; a rouged young boy forced into prostitution, dancing the sort of steps once performed by an organ grinder's monkey.[24]\\r\\nMeghan O'Rouke, Slate Magazine's culture critic and advisory editor, ultimately found The Kite Runner mediocre, writing, \\"This is a novel simultaneously striving to deliver a large-scale informative portrait and to stage a small-scale redemptive drama, but its therapeutic allegory of recovery can only undermine its realist ambitions. People experience their lives against the backdrop of their culture, and while Hosseini wisely steers clear of merely exoticizing Afghanistan as a monolithically foreign place, he does so much work to make his novel emotionally accessible to the American reader that there is almost no room, in the end, for us to consider for long what might differentiate Afghans and Americans.\\"[25] Sarah Smith from The Guardian thought the novel started out well but began to falter towards the end. She felt that Hosseini was too focused on fully redeeming the protagonist in Part III and in doing so created too many unrealistic coincidences that allowed Amir the opportunity to undo his past wrongs.[20]\\r\\nThe Kite Runner has been accused of 'hindering' Western understanding of the Taliban[by whom?] by portraying its members as representatives of various social and doctrinal evils that the Taliban and their supporters do not consider typical and which they feel portray Taliban in an unfavourable light. Examples of this would be: Assef's pedophilia, Nazism, drug abuse, and sadism, and the fact that he is an executioner.[30] The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most-challenged books of 2008, with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to its \\"offensive language, sexually explicit [content], and unsuit[ability for] age group.\\"[31] Afghan American readers were particularly hostile towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed.[11] Hosseini responded in an interview, \\"They never say I am speaking about things that are untrue. Their beef is, 'Why do you have to talk about these things and embarrass us? Don't you love your country?'\\"[11]\\r\\nThe film generated more controversy through the 30-second rape scene, with threats made against the child actors, who originated from Afghanistan.[28] Zakria Ebrahimi, the 12-year-old actor who portrayed Amir, had to be removed from school after his Hazara classmates threatened to kill him,[32] and Paramount Pictures was eventually forced to relocate three of the children to the United Arab Emirates.[28] Afghanistan's Ministry of Culture banned the film from distribution in cinemas or DVD stores, citing the possibility that the movie's ethnically charged rape scene could incite racial violence within Afghanistan.[33]\\r\\nFour years after its publication, The Kite Runner was adapted as a motion picture starring Khalid Abdalla as Amir, Homayoun Ershadi as Baba, and Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada as Hassan. It was initially scheduled to premiere in November 2007, but the release date was pushed back six weeks to evacuate the Afghan child stars from the country after they received death threats.[34] Directed by Marc Forster and with a screenplay by David Benioff, the movie won numerous awards and was nominated for an Academy Award, the BAFTA Film Award, and the Critics Choice Award in 2008.[35] While reviews were generally positive, with Entertainment Weekly deeming the final product \\"pretty good\\",[36] the depiction of ethnic tensions and the controversial rape scene drew outrage in Afghanistan.[34] Hangama Anwari, the child rights commissioner for the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, commented, \\"They should not play around with the lives and security of people. The Hazara people will take it as an insult.\\"[34]\\r\\nHosseini was surprised by the extent of the controversy caused by the rape scene and vocalized that Afghan actors would not have been cast had studios known that their lives would be threatened.[28] He believed that the scene was necessary to \\"maintain the integrity\\" of the story, as a physical assault by itself would not have affected the audience as much.[28]\\r\\nThe novel was first adapted to the stage in March 2007 by Bay Area playwright Matthew Spangler where it was performed at San Jose State University.[37] Two years later, David Ira Goldstein, artistic director of Arizona Theater Company, organized for it to be performed at San Jose Repertory Theatre. The play was produced at Arizona Theatre Company in 2009, Actor's Theatre of Louisville and Cleveland Play House in 2010, and The New Repertory Theatre of Watertown, Massachusetts in 2012. The theatre adaption premiered in Canada as a co-production between Theatre Calgary and the Citadel Theatre in January 2013. In April 2013, the play premiered in Europe at the Nottingham Playhouse, with Ben Turner acting in the lead role.[38]\\r\\nHosseini was approached by Piemme, his Italian publisher, about converting The Kite Runner to a graphic novel in 2011. Having been \\"a fan of comic books since childhood\\", he was open to the idea, believing that The Kite Runner was a good candidate to be presented in a visual format.[29] Fabio Celoni provided the illustrations for the project and regularly updated Hosseini on his progress before its release in September of that year.[29] The latter was pleased with the final product and said, \\"I believe Fabio Celoni's work vividly brings to life not only the mountains, the bazaars, the city of Kabul and its kite-dotted skies, but also the many struggles, conflicts, and emotional highs and lows of Amir's journey.\\"[29]","field3":"What type of book is the kite runner?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"hard, bony outgrowths or gelatinous cysts on the proximal interphalangeal joints","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Bouchard's nodes are hard, bony outgrowths or gelatinous cysts on the proximal interphalangeal joints (the middle joints of fingers or toes).

Former Governor William McKinley, the Republican candidate, defeated Democrat William Jennings Bryan. The 1896 campaign, which took place during an economic depression known as the Panic of 1893, was a realigning election that ended the old Third Party System and began the Fourth Party System.[2]\\r\\nIncumbent Democratic President Grover Cleveland did not seek for reelection for a second (or third non-consecutive) term, leaving the Democratic nomination open. Bryan, an attorney and former Congressman, galvanized support with his Cross of Gold speech, which called for a reform of the monetary system and attacked business leaders as the cause of ongoing economic depression. The 1896 Democratic National Convention repudiated the Cleveland administration and nominated Bryan on the fifth presidential ballot. Bryan then won the nomination of the Populist Party, which had won several states in 1892 and shared many of Bryan's policies. In opposition to Bryan, some conservative Bourbon Democrats formed the National Democratic Party and nominated Senator John M. Palmer. McKinley prevailed by a wide margin on the first ballot of the 1896 Republican National Convention.\\r\\nSince the onset of the Panic of 1893, the nation had been mired in a deep economic depression, marked by low prices, low profits, high unemployment, and violent strikes. Economic issues, especially tariff policy and the question of whether the gold standard should be preserved for the money supply, were central issues. McKinley forged a conservative coalition in which businessmen, professionals, skilled factory workers, and prosperous farmers were heavily represented. McKinley was strongest in cities and in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, and Pacific Coast. Republican campaign manager Mark Hanna pioneered many modern campaign techniques, facilitated by a $3.5 million budget. Bryan presented his campaign as a crusade of the working man against the rich, who impoverished America by limiting the money supply. Silver, he said, was in ample supply and if coined into money would restore prosperity while undermining the illicit power of the money trust. Bryan was strongest in the South, rural Midwest, and Rocky Mountain states. Bryan's moralistic rhetoric and crusade for inflation (to be generated by the institution of bimetallism) alienated conservatives.\\r\\nBryan campaigned vigorously throughout the swing states of the Midwest, while McKinley conducted a \\"front porch\\" campaign. At the end of an intensely heated contest, McKinley won a majority of the popular and electoral vote. Bryan won 46.7% of the popular vote, while Palmer won just under 1% of the vote. Turnout was very high, passing 90% of the eligible voters in many places. The Democratic Party's repudiation of its Bourbon faction largely gave Bryan and his supporters control of the Democratic Party until the 1920s, and set the stage for Republican domination of the Fourth Party System.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt their convention in St. Louis, Missouri, held between June 16 and 18, 1896, the Republicans nominated William McKinley for president and New Jersey's Garret Hobart for vice-president. McKinley had just vacated the office of Governor of Ohio. Both candidates were easily nominated on first ballots.\\r\\nMcKinley's campaign manager, a wealthy and talented Ohio businessman named Mark Hanna, visited the leaders of large corporations and major, influential banks after the Republican Convention to raise funds for the campaign. Given that many businessmen and bankers were terrified of Bryan's populist rhetoric and demand for the end of the gold standard, Hanna had few problems in raising record amounts of money. As a result, Hanna raised a staggering $3.5 million for the campaign and outspent the Democrats by an estimated 5-to-1 margin. This sum would be equivalent to approximately $85 million, according to the inflation calculator of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Major McKinley was the last veteran of the American Civil War to be nominated for president by either major party.\\r\\nOne month after McKinley's nomination, supporters of silver-backed currency took control of the Democratic convention held in Chicago on July 7ÿ11. Most of the Southern and Western delegates were committed to implementing the \\"free silver\\" ideas of the Populist Party. The convention repudiated President Cleveland's gold standard policies and then repudiated Cleveland himself. This, however, left the convention wide open: there was no obvious successor to Cleveland. A two-thirds vote was required for the nomination and the silverites had it in spite of the extreme regional polarization of the delegates. In a test vote on an anti-silver measure, the Eastern states (from Maryland to Maine), with 28% of the delegates, voted 96% in favor. The other delegates voted 91% against, so the silverites could count on a majority of 67% of the delegates.[3]\\r\\nAn attorney, former congressman, and unsuccessful Senate candidate named William Jennings Bryan filled the void. A superb orator, Bryan hailed from Nebraska and spoke for the farmers who were suffering from the economic depression following the Panic of 1893. At the convention, Bryan delivered one of the greatest political speeches in American history, the \\"Cross of Gold\\" Speech. Bryan presented a passionate defense of farmers and factory workers struggling to survive the economic depression, and he attacked big-city business owners and leaders as the cause of much of their suffering. He called for reform of the monetary system, an end to the gold standard, and government relief efforts for farmers and others hurt by the economic depression. Bryan's speech was so dramatic that after he had finished many delegates carried him on their shoulders around the convention hall.\\r\\nThe following day, eight names were placed in nomination: Richard \\"Silver Dick\\" Bland, William J. Bryan, Claude Matthews, Horace Boies, Joseph Blackburn, John R. McLean, Robert E. Pattison, and Sylvester Pennoyer. Bryan's electrifying speech proved decisive as the party's presidential nomination was bestowed on him by the convention delegates. Bryan defeated his closest competitor, former Congressman Bland, by a 3-to-1 margin. Arthur Sewall, a wealthy shipbuilder from Maine, was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee. It was felt that Sewall's wealth might encourage him to help pay some campaign expenses. At just 36 years of age, Bryan was only a year older than the minimum age required by the Constitution to be president. Bryan remains the youngest person ever nominated by a major party for president.\\r\\nNational Democratic candidates\\r\\nThe pro-gold Democrats reacted to Bryan's nomination with a mixture of anger, desperation, and confusion. A number of pro-gold Bourbon Democrats urged a \\"bolt\\" and the formation of a third party. In response, a hastily arranged assembly on July 24 organized the National Democratic Party. A follow-up meeting in August scheduled a nominating convention for September in Indianapolis and issued an appeal to fellow Democrats. In this document, the National Democratic Party portrayed itself as the legitimate heir to Presidents Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland.\\r\\nDelegates from forty-one states gathered at the National Democratic Party's national nominating convention in Indianapolis on September 2. Some delegates planned to nominate Cleveland, but they relented after a telegram arrived stating that he would not accept. Senator William Freeman Vilas from Wisconsin, the main drafter of the National Democratic Party's platform, was a favorite of the delegates. However, Vilas refused to run as the party's sacrificial lamb. The choice instead was John M. Palmer, a 79-year-old former Senator from Illinois.[4] Simon Bolivar Buckner, a 73-year-old former governor of Kentucky, was nominated by acclamation for vice-president. The ticket, symbolic of post-Civil War reconciliation, featured the oldest combined age of the candidates in American history.\\r\\nDespite their advanced ages, Palmer and Buckner embarked on a busy speaking tour, including visits to most major cities in the East. This won them considerable respect from the party faithful, although some found it hard to take the geriatric campaigning seriously. \\"You would laugh yourself sick could you see old Palmer,\\" wrote lawyer Kenesaw Mountain Landis. \\"He has actually gotten it into his head he is running for office.\\"[5] The Palmer ticket was considered to be a vehicle to elect McKinley for some Gold Democrats, such as William Collins Whitney and Abram Hewitt, the treasurer of the National Democratic Party, and they received quiet financial support from Mark Hanna. Palmer himself said at a campaign stop that if \\"this vast crowd casts its vote for William McKinley next Tuesday, I shall charge them with no sin.\\"[6] There was even some cooperation with the Republican Party, especially in finances. The Republicans hoped that Palmer could draw enough Democratic votes from Bryan to tip marginal Midwestern and border states into McKinley's column. In a private letter, Hewitt underscored the \\"entire harmony of action\\" between both parties in standing against Bryan.[7]\\r\\nHowever, the National Democratic Party was not merely an adjunct to the McKinley campaign. An important goal was to nurture a loyal remnant for future victory. Repeatedly they depicted Bryan's prospective defeat, and a credible showing for Palmer, as paving the way for ultimate recapture of the Democratic Party, and this did indeed happen in 1904.[8]\\r\\nPopulist candidates:\\r\\nSeveral third parties were active in 1896. By far the most prominent was the Populist Party. Formed in 1892, the Populists represented the philosophy of agrarianism (derived from Jeffersonian democracy), which held that farming was a superior way of life that was being exploited by bankers and middlemen. The Populists attracted cotton farmers in the South and wheat farmers in the West, but very few farmers in the Northeast, South, West, and rural Midwest. In the presidential election of 1892, Populist candidate James B. Weaver carried four states, and in 1894, the Populists scored victories in congressional and state legislature races in a number of Southern and Western states. In the Southern states, including Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, the wins were obtained by electoral fusion with the Republicans against the dominant Bourbon Democrats, whereas in the rest of the country, fusion, if practiced, was typically undertaken with the Democrats, as in the state of Washington.[9][10] By 1896, some Populists believed that they could replace the Democrats as the main opposition party to the Republicans. However, the Democrats' nomination of Bryan, who supported many Populist goals and ideas, placed the party in a dilemma. Torn between choosing their own presidential candidate or supporting Bryan, the party leadership decided that nominating their own candidate would simply divide the forces of reform and hand the election to the more conservative Republicans. At their national convention in 1896, the Populists chose Bryan as their presidential nominee. However, to demonstrate that they were still independent from the Democrats, the Populists also chose former Georgia Representative Thomas E. Watson as their vice-presidential candidate instead of Arthur Sewall. Bryan eagerly accepted the Populist nomination, but was vague as to whether, if elected, he would choose Watson as his vice-president instead of Sewall. With this election, the Populists began to be absorbed into the Democratic Party; within a few elections the party would disappear completely. The 1896 election was particularly detrimental to the Populist Party in the South; the party divided itself between members who favored cooperation with the Democrats to achieve reform at the national level and members who favored cooperation with the Republicans to achieve reform at a state level.\\r\\nAs a result of the double nomination, both the Bryan-Sewall Democratic ticket and the Bryan-Watson Populist ticket appeared on the ballot in many states. Although the Populist ticket did not win the popular vote in any state, 27 electors for Bryan cast their vice-presidential vote for Watson instead of Sewall. (The votes came from the following states: Arkansas 3, Louisiana 4, Missouri 4, Montana 1, Nebraska 4, North Carolina 5, South Dakota 2, Utah 1, Washington 2, Wyoming 1.)\\r\\nSilver candidates:\\r\\nWilliam Jennings Bryan from Nebraska\\r\\nSenator Henry M. Teller from Colorado\\r\\n(declined)\\r\\nWith the Republican Party platform calling for strong support for the gold standard, many western Republicans walked out of the Republican Convention and formed the National Silver Party. Many began to push for the nomination of Colorado Senator Henry Moore Teller, the leader of the party, but with the nomination of William Jennings Bryan in Chicago and the adoption of his pro-silver platform, it was decided that they should unite behind the Democratic ticket.[11] The Bryan campaign swept to victory across the Mountain states because the dominant issue in those thinly-populated mining areas was silver.[12]\\r\\nThe Socialist Labor Convention was held in New York City on July 9, 1896. The convention nominated Charles Matchett of New York and Matthew Maguire of New Jersey. Its platform favored reduction in hours of labor; possession by the federal government of mines, railroads, canals, telegraphs, and telephones; possession by municipalities of water-works, gas-works, and electric plants; the issue of money by the federal government alone; the employment of the unemployed by the public authorities; abolition of the veto power; abolition of the United States Senate; women's suffrage; and uniform criminal law throughout the Union.[13]\\r\\nThe Prohibition Party split into a \\"narrow gauge,\\" or single-issue anti-liquor party and a \\"broad gauge\\" group (later known as the National Prohibition Party) that supported many reforms, including free silver. The split occurred when a motion for the party to endorse free silver, put forward by Charles Bentley, was defeated by an overwhelming margin of 650-160. Although Bryan himself later became a champion of prohibition, his position was unknown in 1896.[14]\\r\\n\\"Narrow Gauge\\" Prohibition ticket:\\r\\nJoshua Levering, Baptist leader from Maryland\\r\\nLawyer and Former Mayor Hale Johnson from Illinois\\r\\n\\"Broad Gauge\\" Prohibition ticket:\\r\\nCharles E. Bentley, Baptist minister from Nebraska\\r\\nJames H. Southgate, State Party Chair from North Carolina\\r\\nWhile the Republican Party entered 1896 assuming that the Democrats were in shambles and victory would be easy, especially after the unprecedented Republican landslide in the congressional elections of 1894, the nationwide emotional response to the Bryan candidacy changed everything. By summer, it appeared that Bryan was ahead in the South and West and probably also in the Midwest.[15][16] An entirely new strategy was called for by the McKinley campaign. It was designed to educate voters in the money issues, to demonstrate silverite fallacies, and to portray Bryan himself as a dangerous crusader. McKinley would be portrayed as the safe and sound champion of jobs and sound money, with his high tariff proposals guaranteed to return prosperity for everyone. The McKinley campaign would be national and centralized, using the Republican National Committee as the tool of the candidate, instead of the state parties' tool.[17] Furthermore, the McKinley campaign stressed his pluralistic commitment to prosperity for all groups (including minorities).[18]\\r\\nThe McKinley campaign invented a new form of campaign financing that has dominated American politics ever since.[19] Instead of asking office holders to return a cut of their pay, Hanna went to financiers and industrialists and made a business proposition. He explained that Bryan would win if nothing happened, and that the McKinley team had a winning counterattack that would be very expensive. He then would ask them how much it was worth to the business not to have Bryan as president. He suggested an amount and was happy to take a check. Hanna had moved beyond partisanship and campaign rhetoric to a businessman's thinking about how to achieve a desired result. He raised $3.5 million. Hanna brought in banker Charles G. Dawes to run his Chicago office and spend about $2 million in the critical region.[20]\\r\\nMeanwhile, traditional funders of the Democratic Party (mostly financiers from the Northeast) rejected Bryan, although he did manage to raise about $500,000. Some of it came from businessmen with interests in silver mining.\\r\\nThe financial disparity grew larger and larger as the Republicans funded more and more rallies, speeches, and torchlight parades, as well as hundreds of millions of pamphlets attacking Bryan and praising McKinley. Lacking a systematic fund-raising system, Bryan was unable to tap his potential supporters, and he had to rely on passing the hat at rallies. National Chairman Jones pleaded, \\"No matter in how small sums, no matter by what humble contributions, let the friends of liberty and national honor contribute all they can.\\"[21]\\r\\nIncreasingly, the Republicans personalized their attacks on Bryan as a dangerous religious fanatic.[22] The counter-crusading rhetoric focused on Bryan as a reckless revolutionary whose policies would destroy the economic system.[23] Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld was running for re-election after having pardoned several of the anarchists convicted in the Haymarket bombings. Republican posters and speeches linked Altgeld and Bryan as two dangerous anarchists.[24] The Republican Party tried any number of tactics to ridicule Bryan's economic policies. In one case they printed fake dollar bills which had Bryan's face and read \\"IN GOD WE TRUST...FOR THE OTHER 53 CENTS,\\" thus illustrating their claim that a dollar bill would be worth only 47 cents if it was backed by silver instead of gold.[25]\\r\\nThe Democratic Party in Eastern and Midwestern cities had a strong German Catholic base that was alienated by free silver and inflationist panaceas. They showed little enthusiasm for Bryan, although many were worried that a Republican victory would bring prohibition into play.[26][27] The Irish Catholics disliked Bryan's revivalistic rhetoric and worried about prohibition as well. However their leaders decided to stick with Bryan, since the departure of so many Bourbon businessmen from the party left the Irish increasingly in control.[28][29]\\r\\nThe Bryan campaign appealed first of all to farmers. It told urban workers that their return to prosperity was possible only if the farmers prospered first. Bryan made the point bluntly in the \\"Cross of Gold\\" speech, delivered in Chicago just 25 years after that city had indeed burned down:[30]\\r\\nJuxtaposing \\"our farms\\" and \\"your cities\\" did not go over well in cities; they voted 59% for McKinley. Among the industrial cities Bryan carried only two (Troy, New York, and Fort Wayne, Indiana).[31]\\r\\nThe main labor unions were reluctant to endorse Bryan because their members feared inflation.[32][33] Railroad workers especially worried that Bryan's silver programs would bankrupt the railroads, which were in a shaky financial condition in the depression and whose bonds were payable in gold. Factory workers saw no advantage in inflation to help miners and farmers, because their urban cost of living would shoot up and they would be hurt. The McKinley campaign gave special attention to skilled workers, especially in the Midwest and adjacent states.[34] Secret polls show that large majorities of railroad and factory workers voted for McKinley.[35]\\r\\nThroughout the campaign the South and Mountain states appeared certain to vote for Bryan, whereas the East was certain for McKinley. In play were the Midwest and the Border States.\\r\\nThe Republican Party amassed an unprecedented war chest at all levels: national, state and local. Outspent and shut out of the party's traditional newspapers, Bryan decided his best chance to win the election was to conduct a vigorous national speaking tour by train. His fiery crusading rhetoric to huge audiences would make his campaign a newsworthy story that the hostile press would have to cover, and he could speak to the voters directly instead of through editorials. He was the first presidential candidate since Stephen Douglas in 1860 to canvass directly, and the first ever to criss-cross the nation and meet voters in person.\\r\\nThe novelty of seeing a visiting presidential candidate, combined with Bryan's spellbinding oratory and the passion of his believers, generated huge crowds. Silverites welcomed their hero with all-day celebrations of parades, band music, picnic meals, endless speeches, and undying demonstrations of support. Bryan focused his efforts on the Midwest, which everyone agreed would be the decisive battleground in the election. In just 100 days, Bryan gave over 500 speeches to several million people. His record was 36 speeches in one day in St. Louis. Relying on just a few hours of sleep a night, he traveled 18,000 miles by rail[36] to address five million people, often in a hoarse voice; he would explain that he left his real voice at the previous stops where it was still rallying the people.\\r\\nIn contrast to Bryan's dramatic efforts, McKinley conducted a novel \\"front porch\\" campaign from his home in Canton, Ohio. Instead of having McKinley travel to see the voters, Mark Hanna brought 500,000 voters by train to McKinley's home. Once there, McKinley would greet the men from his porch. His well-organized staff prepared both the remarks of the visiting delegations and the candidate's responses, focusing the comments on the assigned topic of the day. The remarks were issued to the newsmen and telegraphed nationwide to appear in the next day's papers. Bryan, with practically no staff, gave much the same talk over and over again. McKinley labeled Bryan's proposed social and economic reforms as a serious threat to the national economy. With the depression following the Panic of 1893 coming to an end, support for McKinley's more conservative economic policies increased, while Bryan's more radical policies began to lose support among Midwestern farmers and factory workers.\\r\\nTo ensure victory, Hanna paid large numbers of Republican orators (including Theodore Roosevelt) to travel around the nation denouncing Bryan as a dangerous radical. There were also reports that some potentially Democratic voters were intimidated into voting for McKinley. For example, some factory owners posted signs the day before the election announcing that, if Bryan won the election, the factory would be closed and the workers would lose their jobs.\\r\\nBryan's midsummer surge in the Midwest played out as the intense Republican counter-crusade proved effective. Bryan spent most of October in the Midwest, making 160 of his final 250 speeches there. Morgan noted, \\"full organization, Republican party harmony, a campaign of education with the printed and spoken word would more than counteract\\" Bryan's speechmaking.[37]\\r\\nSeveral of Bryan's advisors recommended additional campaigning in the Upper South States of Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland and Delaware. Another plan called for a coastal tour from Washington State to Southern California. Bryan however, opted to concentrate in the Mid-West and to launch a unity tour into the heavily Republican Northeast. Bryan saw no chance of winning in New England, but felt that he needed to make a truly national appeal. On election day the results from the Pacific Coast and Upper South would be the closest of the election.\\r\\nMcKinley secured a solid victory by carrying the core of the East and Northeast, while Bryan did well among the farmers of the South, West, and rural Midwest. The large German-American voting bloc supported McKinley, who gained large majorities among the middle class, skilled factory workers, railroad workers, and large-scale farmers. The national popular vote was rather close, as McKinley took 51% to Bryans 47%. In the electoral college McKinley won in a landslide, receiving 271 electoral votes (61%) to Bryan's 176 (224 were needed to win).\\r\\nThe National Democrats did not carry any states, but they did divide the Democratic vote in some states and helped the Republicans to carry the state of Kentucky. Gold Democrats made much of the fact that Palmers small vote in Kentucky was higher than McKinleys thin margin in that state. This was the first time a Republican presidential candidate had ever carried Kentucky, and they were not to do so again until Calvin Coolidge in 1924.[38] From this, they concluded that Palmer had siphoned off needed Democratic votes and hence thrown the state to McKinley. However, McKinley would have won the overall election even if he had lost Kentucky to Bryan.\\r\\nMayor Tom L. Johnson of Cleveland, Ohio, summed up the campaign as the first great protest of the American people against monopoly ÿ the first great struggle of the masses in our country against the privileged classes.\\r\\nAccording to a 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper, \\"Bryan did well where mortgage interest rates were high, railroad penetration was low, and crop prices had declined by most over the previous decade. Using our estimates, we show that further declines in crop prices or increases in interest rates would have been enough to tip the Electoral College in Bryans favor. But to change the outcome, the additional fall in crop prices would have had to be large.\\"[39]\\r\\nMcKinley received a little more than seven million votes, Bryan a little less than six and a half million, about 800,000 in excess of the Democratic vote in 1892. It was larger than the Democratic Party was to poll in 1900, 1904, or 1912. It was somewhat less, however, than the combined vote for the Democratic and Populist nominees had been in 1892. In contrast, McKinley received nearly 2,000,000 more votes than had been cast for Benjamin Harrison, the Republican nominee, in 1892. The Republican vote was to be but slightly increased during the next decade.\\r\\nOne-half of the total vote of the nation was polled in eight states carried by McKinley (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin). In these states, Bryan not only ran far behind the Republican candidate, but also polled considerably less than half of his total vote.[41]\\r\\nIn only one other section, in the six states of New England, was the Republican lead great; the Republican vote (614,972) was more than twice the Democratic vote (242,938), and every county was carried by the Republicans.[41]\\r\\nThe West North Central section gave a slight lead to McKinley, as did the Pacific section. Nevertheless, within these sections, the states of Missouri, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Washington were carried by Bryan.\\r\\nIn the South Atlantic section and in the East South Central section, the Democratic lead was pronounced, and in the West South Central section and in the Mountain section, the vote for Bryan was overwhelming. In these four sections, comprising 21 states, McKinley carried only 322 counties and four states ÿ Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Kentucky.\\r\\nA striking feature of this examination of the state returns is found in the overwhelming lead for one or the other party in 22 of the 45 states. It was true of the McKinley vote in every New England state and in New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. It was also true of the Bryan vote in eight states of the lower South and five states of the Mountain West. Sectionalism was thus marked in this first election of the Fourth Party System.\\r\\nThis was the last election in which the Democrats won South Dakota until 1932, the last in which the Democrats won Utah and Washington until 1916, the last in which the Democrats won Kansas and Wyoming until 1912, and the last in which the Democrats won Nebraska until 1908. It was also the last time that South Dakota and Washington voted against the Republicans until they voted for the Progressive Party in 1912. This also constitutes the only election since their statehoods when a Republican won the presidency without winning Kansas, South Dakota, Utah, or Wyoming. Today ( as of 2017) they are solidly Republican states.\\r\\nIn the South, there were numerous Republican counties, notably in Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia. Even in Georgia, a state in the Deep South, there were counties returning Republican majorities. This was the result of an attempt by Republican politicians to heal sectional resentment and make the South competitive.\\r\\nWhile traveling the South in 1895, McKinley realized that many conservative Southern whites were angry at the populist radicals who controlled the Democratic Party in their states. White businessmen of Georgia wanted the support of a party that would oppose regulation and taxation as long as it would allow them to preserve white supremacy. The possibility of preserving white supremacy without offending loyal black Republicans seemed like a possibility after black leader Booker T. Washington gave a speech in 1895 that proposed the \\"Atlanta Compromise\\", which held that whites should support blacks in their struggle for economic independence as they learned trade and industry, and in return blacks would not challenge the political or social order of Jim Crow. The policy was somewhat of a success because McKinley won 37% of Georgia's vote (the closest a Republican would come to winning the state until 1928).\\r\\n(a) Includes 222,583 votes as the People's nominee\\r\\n(b) Sewall was Bryan's Democratic running mate.\\r\\n(c) Watson was Bryan's People's running mate.\\r\\nSource (Popular Vote):[42]\\r\\nSource (Electoral Vote): \\"Electoral College Box Scores 1789ÿ1996\\".

Local, state, and federal funds totaling $15 million were used to finance the event. More than 60 countries and 43 of the 45 American states maintained exhibition spaces at the fair, which was attended by nearly 19.7 million people.\\r\\nHistorians generally emphasize the prominence of themes of race and empire, and the fair's long-lasting impact on intellectuals in the fields of history, art history, architecture and anthropology. From the point of view of the memory of the average person who attended the fair, it primarily promoted entertainment, consumer goods and popular culture.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1904, St. Louis hosted a World's Fair to celebrate the centennial of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. The idea for such a commemorative event seems to have emerged early in 1898, with Kansas City and St. Louis initially presented as potential hosts for a fair based on their central location within the territory encompassed by the 1803 land annexation.[4]\\r\\nThe exhibition was grand in scale and lengthy in preparation, with an initial $5 million committed by the city of St. Louis through the sale of city bonds was authorized by the Missouri state legislature in April 1899.[5] An additional $5 million was generated through private donations by interested citizens and businesses from around Missouri, a fundraising target reached in January 1901.[6] The final installment of $5 million of the exposition's $15 million capitalization came in the form of earmarked funds that were part of a congressional appropriations bill passed at the end of May 1900.[7] The fundraising mission was aided by the active support of President of the United States William McKinley, which was won by organizers in a February 1899 White House visit.[8]\\r\\nWhile initially conceived as a centennial celebration to be held in 1903, the actual opening of the St. Louis exposition was delayed until April 30, 1904, to allow for full-scale participation by more states and foreign countries. The exposition remained in operation from its opening until December 1, 1904. During the year of the fair, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition supplanted the annual St. Louis Exposition of agricultural, trade, and scientific exhibitions which had been held in the city since the 1880s.\\r\\nThe fair's 1,200-acre (4.9?km2) site, designed by George Kessler,[9] was located at the present-day grounds of Forest Park and on the campus of Washington University, and was the largest fair (in area) to date. There were over 1,500 buildings, connected by some 75 miles (121?km) of roads and walkways. It was said to be impossible to give even a hurried glance at everything in less than a week. The Palace of Agriculture alone covered some 20 acres (81,000?m2).\\r\\nExhibits were staged by approximately 50 foreign nations, the United States government, and 43 of the then-45 U.S. states. These featured industries, cities, private organizations and corporations, theater troupes, and music schools. There were also over 50 concession-type amusements found on \\"The Pike\\"; they provided educational and scientific displays, exhibits and imaginary 'travel' to distant lands, history and local boosterism (including Louis Wollbrinck's \\"Old St. Louis\\") and pure entertainment.\\r\\nOver 19 million (19,694,855, to be precise[10]) individuals were in attendance at the fair.\\r\\nIn conjunction with the Exposition the U.S. Post Office issued a series of five commemorative stamps celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase. The 1-cent value portrayed Robert Livingston, the ambassador who negotiated the purchase with France, the 2-cent value depicts Thomas Jefferson, who executed the purchase, the 3-cent honors James Monroe, who participated in negotiations with the French, the 5-cent memorializes William McKinley, who was involved with early plans for the Exposition and the 10-cent presents a map of the Louisiana Purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Livingston\\r\\nThomas Jefferson\\r\\nJames Monroe\\r\\nWilliam McKinley\\r\\nMap of Louisiana\\r\\nKessler, who designed many urban parks in Texas and the Midwest, created the master design for the Fair.\\r\\nA popular myth says that Frederick Law Olmsted, who had died the year before the Fair, designed the park and fair grounds. There are several reasons for this confusion. First, Kessler in his twenties had worked briefly for Olmsted as a Central Park gardener. Second, Olmsted was involved with Forest Park in Queens, New York. Third, Olmsted had planned the renovations in 1897 to the Missouri Botanical Garden several blocks to the southeast of the park.[11] Finally, Olmsted's sons advised Washington University on integrating the campus with the park across the street.\\r\\nIn 1901 the Louisiana Purchase Exposition Corporation selected prominent St. Louis architect Isaac S. Taylor as the Chairman of the Architectural Commission and Director of Works for the fair, supervising the overall design and construction. Taylor quickly appointed Emmanuel Louis Masqueray to be his Chief of Design. In the position for three years, Masqueray designed the following Fair buildings: Palace of Agriculture, the Cascades and Colonnades, Palace of Forestry, Fish, and Game, Palace of Horticulture and Palace of Transportation, all of which were widely emulated in civic projects across the United States as part of the City Beautiful movement. Masqueray resigned shortly after the Fair opened in 1904, having been invited by Archbishop John Ireland of St. Paul, Minnesota to design a new cathedral for the city.[4]\\r\\nPaul J. Pelz was architect for the Palace of Machinery.[12]\\r\\nAccording to a claim in a 1923 edition of The Colored Citizen of Pensacola, Florida, the majority of work in building the fair was done by African Americans, including all the engineering calculations for the layout of the park. Many African Americans contributed to architecture design, but were not credited.[13]\\r\\nFlorence Hayward, a successful freelance writer in St. Louis in the 1900s was determined to play a role in the World's Fair. She negotiated a position on the otherwise all-male Board of Commissioners. Hayward learned that one of the potential contractors for the fair was not reputable and warned the Louisiana Purchase Exposition Company (LPEC). In exchange for this information, she requested an appointment as roving commissioner to Europe.\\r\\nFormer Mayor of St. Louis and Governor of Missouri David R. Francis, LPEC president, made the appointment and allowed Hayward to travel overseas to promote the fair, especially to women. The fair also had a Board of Lady Managers (BLM) who felt they had jurisdiction over women's activities at the fair and objected to Hayward's appointment without their knowledge. Despite this, Hayward set out for England in 1902. Hayward's most notable contribution to the fair was acquiring gifts Queen Victoria received for her Golden Jubilee and other historical items, including manuscripts from the Vatican. These items were all to be shown in exhibits at the fair.\\r\\nPleased with her success in Europe, Francis put her in charge of historical exhibits in the anthropology division, which had originally been assigned to Pierre Chouteau III. Despite being the only woman on the Board of Commissioners, creating successful anthropological exhibits, publicizing the fair, and acquiring significant exhibit items, Hayward's role in the fair was not acknowledged. When Francis published a history of the fair in 1913, he did not mention Hayward's contributions and she never forgave the slight.[14]\\r\\nExpositions are the timekeepers of progress. They record the world's advancement. They stimulate the energy, enterprise, and intellect of the people; and quicken human genius. They go into the home. They broaden and brighten the daily life of the people. They open mighty storehouses of information to the student. -President William McKinley at the 1901 World's Fair\\r\\nThe World Fairs are known for bringing new technology, innovation, and scientific discoveries to the average person. At the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, many of the inventions displayed were precursors to items which have become an integral part of today's culture. Novel applications of electricity and light waves for communication and medical use were displayed in the Palace of Electricity.[15] According to an article he wrote for Harper's Weekly, W.E. Goldsborough, the Chief of the Department of Electricity for the Fair, wished to educate the public and dispel the misconceptions about electricity which many common people believed.[16] New and updated methods of transportation also showcased at the World's Fair in the Palace of Transportation would come to revolutionize transportation for the modern day.[15][17]\\r\\nWireless Telephone ÿ The \\"wireless telephony\\" unit or \\"radiophone\\" installed at the St. Louis World Fair was a thing of wonder to the crowds.[15][16] Music or spoken messages were transmitted from an apparatus within the Palace of Electricity to a telephone receiver out in the courtyard. The receiver, which was attached to nothing, when placed to the ear allowed a visitor to hear the transmission. This radiophone, invented by Alexander Graham Bell, consisted of a transmitter which transformed sound waves into light waves and a receiver which converted the light waves back into sound waves.[18] This technology has since developed into the radio and early mobile phones.[19]\\r\\nEarly Fax Machine ÿ The telautograph, the precursor to the modern day fax machine, was invented in 1888 by the American scientist, Elisha Gray who at one point in time contested Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone.[20] The telautograph was a device which could send electrical impulses to the receiving pen of the device, in order to be able to recreate drawings to a piece of paper while a person simultaneously wrote them longhand on the other end of the device. In 1900 Gray's assistant, Foster Ritchie, improved upon the original design and it was this device which was displayed at the 1904 World's Fair and marketed for the next thirty years.[21]\\r\\nFinsen Light ÿ The Finsen light, a phototherapy unit invented by Niels Ryberg Finsen, utilized ultraviolet light to treat a form of lupus caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Finsen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1903 for his contributions and his invention pioneered the way which led to many other forms of radiation therapy in the treatment of disease.[22]\\r\\nX-Ray Machine ÿ The X-ray machine was an invention which had its public debut at the 1904 World's Fair. X-rays were first discovered in November 1895 by a German scientist, Wilhelm Conrad R?ntgen, who at the time was studying the phenomena accompanying the passage of an electric current through a gas of extremely low pressure.[23] After Rontgen's discovery, he took an x-ray of his wife's hand, showing the bones and her fingers along with her wedding ring, and sent it to several of his scientist colleagues. One of the scientists that learned of the discovery was Thomas Edison and he soon began to experiment with his own x-ray machine with his assistant Clarence Dally. In 1901, Dally brought a test version of the x-ray machine to the 1901 World's Fair, but failed to test the machine when President McKinley was assassinated.[24] For the 1904 World's Fair, the x-ray machine was perfected and successfully shown to the public. X-rays are now commonplace in hospitals and airports.[25]\\r\\nInfant Incubator ÿ Although infant incubators were invented in the year 1888 by Drs. Alan M. Thomas and William Champion, these devices were not immediately widely used. To increase awareness of the benefits these units provided, infant incubators containing premature babies were displayed at the 1897, 1898, 1901, and 1904 World Fairs.[26] This piece of medical equipment helped neonates with compromised immune systems by providing a sanitary environment to reduce the likelihood of acquiring an infection. Each incubator was an air-tight glass box with a metal frame. Hot air was pumped into the container to keep a constant temperature. Newspapers advertised the incubators with \\"lives are being preserved by this wonderful method.\\"[27] During the World Fair in 1904, E. M. Bayliss brought these devices for exhibition on The Pike where approximately ten nurses cared for twenty-four neo-natal babies while in the infant incubators.[25][27] The exhibit required an entrance fee of twenty-five cents and visitors could also purchase souvenirs and refreshments from the adjoining shop and caf. These proceeds, totaling $181,632, helped to fund Bayliss's project.[25] There were some setbacks with the infant incubator display as the sanitary conditions were not always consistent and some babies died of illness. The incubator area was then modified by installing glass walls to separate the babies from visitors, thus decreasing the exposure of the infants.[28] The science and technology behind the incubators has since been expanded upon. Now known as \\"isolettes,\\" these units are a vital component to caring for neonates in modern neonatal intensive care units.\\r\\nElectric Streetcar ÿ Although street railways had been in use in North America since the early 1800s, electric street railcars were still novel at the time of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Outside of the Palace of Electricity, an exhibit including a working electric street car and 1400 feet of track demonstrated the speed, acceleration, and braking capacities of this new-powered model.[15] Electric railways for inner-city transport are still used in many cities today.[17]\\r\\nPersonal automobile ÿ One of the most popular attractions of the Exposition was contained in the Palace of Transportation: automobiles and motor cars.[15] The automobile display contained 140 models including ones powered by gasoline, steam, and electricity.[17] The private automobile first made its public debut at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.[25] Four years after the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, the Ford Motor Company began producing the Ford Model T making the personal automobile more affordable. Since that time, the automobile has increased in popularity, advanced in technology, and expanded the mobility of humanity.\\r\\nAirplane ÿ The 1904 World's Fair hosted the first ever \\"Airship Contest\\" as aerial navigation was still in its infancy at this time. The Exposition offered a grand prize of $100,000 to the airship or other flying machine with the best time through a course marked out by stationary air balloons while travelling at least 15 miles per hour.[17] Although none were able to earn the grand prize, the contest did witness the first public dirigible flight in America as well as numerous other flights made by various airships. This was the first major event in a history of aviation in St. Louis leading to the city's nickname, Flight City.[29] The science of aerial navigation continued to develop and has been mastered since the 1904 Exposition. Air travel has become a vital component in today's global society.[30][31]\\r\\nAs many people were curious about this up and coming city, many reporters and photographers attended the World Fair to document and understand the city. What they found was nothing like anyone else could have imagined. Still as a relatively new city, the streets were buzzing with activity, with many of its citizens constantly on the \\"go\\" and the streets \\"crowded with activity\\". One observer remarked that, at this time, St. Louis had more energy in its streets than any other Northern Street did.[32]\\r\\nWith more and more people interested in the city, St. Louis government and architects were primarily concerned with their ports and access to the city. Though transportation by water had always been important to the city (St. Louis had originated as a trading post), it was becoming even more important that the port be open, but efficient for all visitors. It also needed to show off some of the city's flair and excitement, which is why in many photographs one sees photos of St. Louis' skyscrapers in the background. In addition to a functioning port, the Eads bridge was constructed, which was considered one of St. Louis' \\"sights\\". 1627 feet long, it connected Missouri and Illinois.[32]\\r\\nAs with the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, all but one of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition's grand, neo-Classical exhibition palaces were temporary structures, designed to last but a year or two. They were built with a material called \\"staff,\\" a mixture of plaster of Paris and hemp fibers, on a wood frame. As at the Chicago world's fair, buildings and statues deteriorated during the months of the Fair, and had to be patched.\\r\\nThe Palace of Fine Art, designed by architect Cass Gilbert, featured a grand interior sculpture court based on the Roman Baths of Caracalla. Standing at the top of Art Hill, it now serves as the home of the St. Louis Art Museum.\\r\\nThe Administration Building, designed by Cope & Stewardson, is now Brookings Hall, the defining landmark on the campus of Washington University. A similar building was erected at Northwest Missouri State University founded in 1905 in Maryville, Missouri. The grounds' layout was also recreated in Maryville and now is designated as the official Missouri State Arboretum.\\r\\nSome mansions from the Exposition's era survive along Lindell Boulevard at the north border of Forest Park.\\r\\nThe huge bird cage at the Saint Louis Zoological Park, dates to the fair. A Jain temple carved out of teak stood within the Indian Pavilion near the Ferris Wheel. It was dismantled after the exhibition and was reconstructed in Las Vegas at the Castaways hotel. It has recently been reassembled and is now on display at the Jain Center of Southern California at Los Angeles. Birmingham, Alabama's iconic cast iron Vulcan statue was first exhibited at the Fair in the Palace of Mines and Metallurgy.\\r\\nThe Missouri State building was the largest of the state buildings, as Missouri was the host state. Though it had sections with marble floors and heating and air conditioning, it was planned to be a temporary structure. However, it burned the night of November 18ÿ19, just eleven days before the Fair was to end. Most of the interior was destroyed, but some contents were rescued without damage, including some furniture and much of the contents of the fair's Model Library. Since the fair was almost over, the building was not rebuilt. After the fair, the current World's Fair Pavilion in Forest Park was built on the site of the Missouri building with profits from the fair in 1909ÿ10.\\r\\nFestival Hall, designed by Cass Gilbert and used for large-scale musical pageants, contained the largest organ in the world at the time, built by the Los Angeles Art Organ Company. After the fair, it was placed into storage, and eventually purchased by John Wanamaker for his new Wanamaker's store in Philadelphia where it became known as the Wanamaker Organ. The famous Bronze Eagle in the Wanamaker Store also came from the Fair. It features hundreds of hand-forged bronze feathers and was the centerpiece of one of the many German exhibits at the fair. Wanamaker's became a Lord & Taylor store and more recently, a Macy's store.\\r\\nCompleted in 1913, the Jefferson Memorial building was built near the main entrance to the Exposition, at Lindell and DeBalivere. It was built with proceeds from the fair, to commemorate Thomas Jefferson, who initiated the Louisiana Purchase, as was the first memorial to the third President. It became the headquarters of the Missouri History Museum, and stored the Exposition's records and archives when the Louisiana Purchase Exposition company completed its mission. The building is now home to the Missouri History Museum, and the museum was significantly expanded in 2002ÿ3.\\r\\nThe State of Maine Building, which was a rustic cabin, was transported to Point Lookout, Missouri where it overlooked the White River by sportsmen who formed the Maine Hunting and Fishing Club. In 1915, when the main building at the College of the Ozarks in Forsyth, Missouri burned, the school relocated to Point Lookout, where the Maine building was renamed the Dobyns Building in honor of a school president. The Dobyns Building burned in 1930 and the college's signature church was built in its place. In 2004, a replica of the Maine building was built on the campus. The Keeter Center is named for another school president.[34][35]\\r\\nThe observation tower erected by the American DeForest Wireless Telegraph Company was purchased by Charles N. Rix, a banker from Hot Springs, Arkansas, who moved it to the summit of Hot Springs Mountain. Renamed the Rix Tower, it reopened to the public on its new location in 1906. Dismantling and reassembling the tower, however, proved to be its worst enemy (it had previously been moved once before, to St. Louis from Buffalo, New York); it was eventually demolished in 1975 due to instability almost certainly caused by being relocated twice. A more modern tower would later be built on the site in 1983.[citation needed]\\r\\nWestinghouse Electric sponsored the Westinghouse Auditorium, where they showed films of Westinghouse factories and products.[36]\\r\\nA number of foods are claimed to have been invented at the fair. The most popular claim is that the waffle-style ice cream cone was invented and first sold during the fair. However, it is widely believed that it was not invented at the Fair, but instead, it was popularized at the Fair.[37][38] Other claims are more dubious, including the hamburger and hot dog (both traditional American foods), peanut butter, iced tea,[39] and cotton candy. It is more likely, however, that these food items were first introduced to mass audiences and popularized by the fair. Dr Pepper and Puffed Wheat cereal were first introduced to a national audience at the fair. Daughter of slaves, Annie Fisher, brought her beaten biscuits, which were already famous in her hometown of Columbia, Missouri. The exposition awarded Fisher's biscuits a gold medal.[40] They would later be enjoyed by President William Howard Taft on his 1911 visit to Missouri.\\r\\nThe fair inspired the song \\"Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis\\", which was recorded by many artists, including Billy Murray. Both the fair and the song are focal points of the 1944 feature film Meet Me in St. Louis starring Judy Garland, which also inspired a Broadway musical version. Scott Joplin wrote the rag \\"Cascades\\" in honor of the elaborate waterfalls in front of Festival Hall.\\r\\nFollowing the SpanishÿAmerican War, the United States acquired new territories such as Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. Some natives from these areas were brought to be on \\"display\\" at the fair. Such displays included the Apache of the American Southwest and the Igorot of the Philippines, both of which peoples were dubbed as \\"primitive\\".[41] Similarly, members of the Southeast Alaskan Tlingit tribe accompanied fourteen totem poles, two Native houses, and a canoe displayed at the Alaska Exhibit.[42]\\r\\nIn contrast, the Japan pavilion advanced the idea of a modern yet exotic culture unfamiliar to the turn-of-the-century Western world,[41] much as it had during the earlier Chicago World's Fair.[43]\\r\\nOta Benga, a Congolese Pygmy, was featured at the fair. Later he was given the run of the grounds at the Bronx Zoo in New York, then featured in an exhibit on evolution alongside an orangutan in 1906, but public protest ended that.\\r\\nOne exhibit of note was Beautiful Jim Key, the \\"educated\\" Arabian-Hambletonian cross horse in his Silver Horseshoe Pavilion. He was owned by Dr. William Key, an African-American/Native American former slave, who became a respected self-taught veterinarian, and promoted by Albert R. Rogers, who had Jim and Dr. Key on tour for years around the US, helping to establish a humane movement that encouraged people to think of animals as having feelings and thoughts, and not just \\"brutes.\\" Jim and Dr. Key became national celebrities along the way. Rogers invented highly successful marketing strategies still in use today. Jim Key could add, subtract, use a cash register, spell with blocks, tell time and give opinions on the politics of the day by shaking his head yes or no. Jim thoroughly enjoyed his \\"act\\"he performed more than just tricks and appeared to clearly understand what was going on. Dr. Key's motto was that Jim \\"was taught by kindness\\" instead of the whip, which he was indeed.[44]\\r\\nAfter the fair was completed, many of the international exhibits were not returned to their country of origin, but were dispersed to museums in the United States. For example, the Philippine exhibits were acquired by the Museum of Natural History at the University of Iowa. The Vulcan statue is today a prominent feature of the Vulcan Park and Museum in Birmingham, Alabama, where it was originally cast.\\r\\nThe Smithsonian Institution coordinated the U.S. government exhibits. It featured a blue whale, the first full-cast of a blue whale ever created.[45]\\r\\nThe Fair also featured the original \\"Floatopia\\". Visitors floated on rafts of all sorts in the tiny Forest Park Lake. Many Floatopias have occurred since, including the infamous San Diego Floatopia of '83 and the Santa Barbara Floatopia that has been happening for years.\\r\\nDaisy E. Nirdlinger's book, Althea, or, the children of Rosemont plantation (illustrated by Egbert Cadmus (1868-1939)) was adopted by the Commissioners of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition as the official souvenir for young people.[46]\\r\\nThe Fair hosted the 1904 Summer Olympic Games, the first Olympics held in the United States. These games had originally been awarded to Chicago, but when St. Louis threatened to hold a rival international competition,[47] the games were relocated. Nonetheless, the sporting events, spread out over several months, were overshadowed by the Fair. With travel expenses high, many European athletes did not come, nor did modern Olympics founder Baron Pierre de Coubertin.\\r\\nOn June 5, 1904, a bullfight scheduled for an arena just north of the fairgrounds, in conjunction with the fair, turned violent when Missouri governor Alexander Monroe Dockery ordered police to halt the fight in light of Missouri's anti-bullfighting laws. Disgruntled spectators demanded refunds, and when they were turned away, they began throwing stones through the windows of the arena office. While police protected the office, they did not have sufficient numbers to protect the arena, which was burned to the ground by the mob. The exposition fire department responded to the fire, but disruption to the fair was minimal, as the riot took place on a Sunday, when the fair was closed.\\r\\nFrank Fillis produced what was supposedly \\"the greatest and most realistic military spectacle known in the history of the world\\". Different portions of the concession featured a British Army encampment, several South African native villages (including Zulu, San, Swazi, and Ndebele) and a 15-acre (61,000?m2) arena in which soldiers paraded, sporting events and horse races were held and major battles from the Second Boer War were re-enacted twice a day. Battle recreations took 2ÿ3 hours and included several Generals and 600 veteran soldiers from both sides of the war. At the conclusion of the show, the Boer General Christiaan de Wet would escape on horseback by leaping from a height of 35 feet (11?m) into a pool of water.\\r\\nAdmission ranged from 25 cents for bleacher seats to one dollar for box seats, and admission to the villages was another 25 cents. The concession cost $48,000 to construct, grossed over $630,000, and netted about $113,000 to the fairthe highest-grossing military concession of the fair.\\r\\nThe Louisiana World fair was opened by US president, Theodore Roosevelt, by telegraph, but he did not attend personally until after the federal election in November 1904, as he stated he did not wish to use the fair for political purposes. Attendees included John Philip Sousa, a musician, composer and conductor whose band performed on opening day and several times during the fair. Thomas Edison is claimed to have attended.\\r\\nRagtime music was popularly featured at the Fair. Scott Joplin wrote \\"The Cascades\\" specifically for the fair, inspired by the waterfalls at the Grand Basin, and presumably attended the fair.\\r\\nHelen Keller, who was 24 and graduated from Radcliffe College, gave a lecture in the main auditorium.[48]\\r\\nJ.T. Stinson, a well-regarded fruit specialist, introduced the phrase, \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away\\" (at a lecture during the exhibition).[49]\\r\\nThe French organist Alexandre Guilmant played a series of 40 recitals, from memory, on the great organ in Festival Hall, then the largest pipe organ in the world.\\r\\nGeronimo, the former war chief of the Apache, was \\"on display\\" in a teepee in the Ethnology Exhibit.\\r\\nHenri Poincar gave a keynote address on mathematical physics, including an outline for what would eventually become known as special relativity.[50][51]\\r\\nJelly Roll Morton did not visit, stating in his later Library of Congress interview and recordings that he expected jazz pianist Tony Jackson would attend and win a jazz piano competition at the Exposition. Morton said he was \\"quite disgusted\\" to later learn that Jackson hadn't gone either, and that the competition had been won instead by Alfred Wilson; Morton considered himself a better pianist than Wilson.\\r\\nThe poet T. S. Eliot, who was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, visited the Igorot Village held in the Philippine Exposition section of the St. Louis World's Fair. Several months after the closing of the World's Fair, he published a short story entitled \\"The Man Who Was King\\" in the school magazine of Smith Academy, St. Louis, Missouri that he was attending. Inspired by the ganza dance which the Igorot people presented regularly in the Village and their reaction to civilization, the poet explored the interaction of a white man with an island culture. Interestingly, all this predates the poet's delving into the anthropological studies during his Harvard graduate years.[52][53]\\r\\nMax Weber visited upon first coming to the United States in hopes of using some of his findings for a case study on capitalism.[54]\\r\\nJack Daniel, the American distiller and the founder of Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey distillery, entered his Tennessee whiskey into the World's Fair whiskey competition. After four hours of deliberation, the eight judges awarded Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey the Gold Medal for the finest whiskey in the world. The award was a boon for the Jack Daniel's distillery.[55][56]\\r\\nNovelist Kate Chopin lived nearby and purchased a season ticket to the fair. After her visit on the hot day of August 20, she suffered a brain hemorrhage and died two days later, on August 22, 1904.[57]\\r\\nPhiladelphia mercantilist, John Wanamaker, visited the exposition in November 1904 and purchased an entire collection of German furniture which included the giant jugenstil brass sculpture of an eagle that he would display in the rotunda of his Wanamaker's department store in Philadelphia. He also purchased the organ from the fair, which at the time was the biggest concert organ in the world.\\r\\nBenedictine monk, artist and museum founder, Fr. Gregory Gerrer, OSB exhibited his recent portrait of Pope Pius X at the fair. Following the fair, Gerrer brought the painting to Shawnee, Oklahoma, where it is now on display at the Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art.[58]\\r\\nJohn McCormack, Irish tenor, was brought to the fair by James A.

The lyrical content depended on the artist and could consist of sex, drugs, violence, vandalism and women, but also of love for a city, love for friends and relaxing words. There was also a slurred lazy or \\"smooth\\" way of rapping in order to clarify words and stay in rhythmic cadence.\\r\\nUnlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as EPMD and The Bomb Squad), G-funk often utilized fewer, unaltered samples per song.[1] Music theorist Adam Krims has described G-funk as \\"a style of generally West Coast rap whose musical tracks tend to deploy live instrumentation, heavy on bass and keyboards, with minimal (sometimes no) sampling and often highly conventional harmonic progressions and harmonies\\".[2] Dr. Dre, a pioneer of the G-funk genre, normally uses live musicians to replay the original music of sampled records. This enabled him to produce music that had his own sounds, rather than a direct copy of the sample.[3]\\r\\nG-funk, given its name by Laylaw from Lawhouse Production, became a very popular genre of hip hop in the 1990s. Although G-funk originated in Los Angeles, the subgenre drew a large amount of influence from the earlier Bay Area-based sound known as Mobb music of the mid- to late 1980s, pioneered by Oakland rappers like Too Short & E-40. Too Short had experimented with looping sounds from classic P-Funk records over bass-heavy tracks during this period. However, unlike Bay Area Mobb music, Southern California-born G-funk used more portamento synthesizers and less live instrumentation. Too Short's lazy, drawl-heavy delivery was also a major influence on later G-funk rappers like Snoop Dogg.[4]\\r\\nThere has been some debate over who should be considered the \\"father of g-funk\\". Dr. Dre is generally believed to have developed the sound,[5] but Cold187um and KMG of Above the Law, Laylaw for Lawhouse Production have claimed that they developed the sound. Cold187um and KMG claim that Dr. Dre did not credit the group for pioneering the style when he released The Chronic, his Death Row debut album.[6] They both released records on Ruthless Records prior to that. Warren G and Snoop Dogg were with Cold187um before joining Dr. Dre and Death Row. On Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle album, Warren G and Daz Dillinger from Tha Dogg Pound claim they produced \\"Ain't No Fun\\", even though Dre is credited as the album's sole producer.[7]\\r\\nThe earliest use of sine wave synthesizers and Parliament-Funkadelic-style bass grooves in Dr. Dre's work appeared on N.W.A's single \\"Alwayz into Somethin'\\" from their 1991 album Efil4zaggin. When Dr. Dre's 1992 Death Row debut album The Chronic was released, the album was immensely successful, and consequently made g-funk a popular genre of hip hop.[8]\\r\\nAnother early G-funk pioneer, also from Compton, was rapper and producer DJ Quik, who was already using P-Funk instrumentals as early as 1991 in his debut album Quik Is the Name, though his most recognizable G-funk album would be 1995's Safe & Sound and also Battlecat, whose aesthetic is a progression from the early-'90s G-Funk sound pioneered by the group Above the Law, characterized by phat synth bass lines and soulful keys. Other well known artists that used G-funk were Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Tupac Shakur, Nate Dogg, Mac Dre, Spice 1, Geto Boys, Havoc & Prodeje, BG Knocc Out, Dresta, Rappin' 4-Tay, 3X Krazy and Warren G. Warren G's first album was called Regulate...G Funk Era, which featured Nate Dogg - who called himself \\"the king of G-funk\\".[9]\\r\\nMany contemporary West Coast rappers have released albums with strong G-Funk influences in recent years.[10] Kendrick Lamar with Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, YG with Still Brazy and Schoolboy Q with Blank Face LP.","field3":"What rapper's unique sound was coined g-funk or gangsta-funk?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"603 rhombus-shaped","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The Louvre Pyramid (Pyramide du Louvre) is a large glass and metal pyramid designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei, surrounded by three smaller pyramids, in the main courtyard (Cour Napolon) of the Louvre Palace (Palais du Louvre) in Paris. The large pyramid serves as the main entrance to the Louvre Museum. Completed in 1989,[1] it has become a landmark of the city of Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCommissioned by the President of France, Fran?ois Mitterrand, in 1984, it was designed by the architect I. M. Pei. The structure, which was constructed entirely with glass segments and metal poles, reaches a height of 21.6 metres (71?ft).[2] Its square base has sides of 34 metres (112?ft) and a base surface area of 1,000 square metres (11,000?sq?ft).[3] It consists of 603 rhombus-shaped and 70 triangular glass segments.[2] The pyramid structure was engineered by Nicolet Chartrand Knoll Ltd. of Montreal (Pyramid Structure / Design Consultant) and Rice Francis Ritchie of Paris (Pyramid Structure / Construction Phase).[4]\\r\\nThe pyramid and the underground lobby beneath it were created because of a series of problems with the Louvre's original main entrance, which could no longer handle the enormous number of visitors on an everyday basis.[citation needed] Visitors entering through the pyramid descend into the spacious lobby then re-ascend into the main Louvre buildings.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor design historian Mark Pimlott, \\"I.M. Peis plan distributes people effectively from the central concourse to myriad destinations within its vast subterranean network... the architectonic framework evokes, at gigantic scale, an ancient atrium of a Pompeiian villa; the treatment of the opening above, with its tracery of engineered castings and cables, evokes the atria of corporate office buildings; the busy movement of people from all directions suggests the concourses of rail termini or international airports.\\"[5]\\r\\nSeveral other museums have duplicated this concept, most notably the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. The Dolphin Centre, featuring a similar pyramid, was opened in April 1982, by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.[6] The construction work on the pyramid base and underground lobby was carried out by the Vinci construction company.[7]\\r\\nIn 1839, according to one newspaper account, in ceremonies commemorating the \\"glorious revolution\\" of 1830, \\"The tombs of the Louvre were covered with black hangings and adorned with tricolored flags. In front and in the middle was erected an expiatory monument of a pyramidical shape, and surmounted by a funeral vase.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe construction of the pyramid triggered many years of strong and lively aesthetic and political debate.[9] Criticisms tended to fall into four areas: (1) the modernist style of the edifice being inconsistent with the classic French Renaissance style and history of the Louvre; (2) the pyramid being an unsuitable symbol of death from ancient Egypt; (3) the project being an immodest, pretentious, megalomaniacal folly imposed by then-President Francois Mitterrand; and (4) Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei being insufficiently French to be entrusted with the task of updating the treasured Parisian landmark.[10]\\r\\nThose criticizing the aesthetics said it was \\"sacrilegious\\" to tamper with the Louvre's majestic old French Renaissance architecture, and called the pyramid an anachronistic intrusion of an Egyptian death symbol in the middle of Paris.[11] Meanwhile, political critics referred to the structure as Pharaoh Francois' Pyramid.[10] Many still continue to feel the harsh modernism of the edifice is out of place.[12][13][14]\\r\\nDuring the design phase, there was a proposal[by whom?] that the design include a spire on the pyramid to simplify window washing. Pei objected, however, and this proposal was eliminated.\\r\\nIt has been claimed by some that the glass panes in the Louvre Pyramid number exactly 666, \\"the number of the beast\\", often associated with Satan. Dominique Stezepfandt's book Fran?ois Mitterrand, Grand Architecte de l'Univers declares that \\"the pyramid is dedicated to a power described as the Beast in the Book of Revelation (...) The entire structure is based on the number 6.\\"\\r\\nThe story of the 666 panes originated in the 1980s, when the official brochure published during construction did indeed cite this number (even twice, though a few pages earlier the total number of panes was given as 672 instead). The number 666 was also mentioned in various newspapers. The Louvre museum, however, states that the finished pyramid contains 673 glass panes (603 rhombi and 70 triangles).[2] A higher figure was obtained by David A. Shugarts, who reports that the pyramid contains 689 pieces of glass.[15] Shugarts obtained the figure from the Pei's offices.\\r\\nElementary arithmetic allows for easy counting of the panes: each of the three sides of the pyramid without an entrance has 18 triangular panes and 17 rows of rhombic ones arranged in a triangle, thus giving \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n17\\r\\n?\\r\\n(\\r\\n17\\r\\n+\\r\\n1\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n153\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\textstyle {\\\\frac {17\\\\cdot (17+1)}{2}}=153}\\r\\n\\r\\n rhombic panes (171 panes total).

Shugarts reports that according to a spokeswoman of the offices of Pei, the French President never specified the number of panes to be used in the pyramid. Noting how the 666 rumor circulated in some French newspapers in the mid-1980s, she commented: \\"If you only found those old articles and didn't do any deeper fact checking, and were extremely credulous, you might believe the 666 story.\\"[15]\\r\\nLa Pyramide Inverse (The Inverted Pyramid) is a skylight in the Carrousel du Louvre shopping mall in front of the Louvre Museum.

Specifically, the ancient Greeks believed health was affecedia=Ancient History Encyclopedia Limited|location=UK|year=2013|url=http://www.ancient.eu.com/Greek_Medicine/%7Caccessdate=November 9, 2013}}</ref> As trials continued wherein theories were tested against symptoms and results, the pure spiritual beliefs regarding \\"punishments\\" and \\"gifts\\" were replaced with a foundation based in the physical, i.e., cause and effect.[1]\\r\\nHumorism (or the four humors) refers to blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. It was also theorized that sex played a role in medicine because some diseases and treatments were different for females than for males. Moreover, geographic location and social class affected the living conditions of the people and might subject them to different environmental issues such as mosquitoes, rats, and availability of clean drinking water. Diet was thought to be an issue as well and might be affected by a lack of access to adequate nourishment. Trauma, such as that suffered by gladiators, from dog bites or other injuries, played a role in theories relating to understanding anatomy and infections. Additionally, there was significant focus on the beliefs and mindset of the patient in the diagnosis and treatment theories. It was recognized that the mind played a role in healing, or that it might also be the sole basis for the illness.[2]\\r\\nAncient Greek medicine began to revolve around the theory of humors.The humoral theory states that good health comes from a perfect balance of the four humors blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Consequently, poor health resulted from improper balance of the four humors. Hippocrates, known as the \\"Father of Modern Medicine\\", established a medical school at Cos and is the most important figure in ancient Greek medicine.[3] Hippocrates and his students documented numerous illnesses in the Hippocratic Corpus, and developed the Hippocratic Oath for physicians, which is still in use today. The contributions to ancient Greek medicine of Hippocrates, Socrates and others had a lasting influence on Islamic medicine and medieval European medicine until many of their findings eventually became obsolete in the 14th century.\\r\\nThe earliest known Greek medical school opened in Cnidus in 700 BC.[dubious ÿ discuss] Alcmaeon, author of the first anatomical compilation,[citation needed] worked at this school, and it was here that the practice of observing patients was established. Despite their known respect for Egyptian medicine, attempts to discern any particular influence on Greek practice at this early time have not been dramatically successful because of the lack of sources and the challenge of understanding ancient medical terminology. It is clear, however, that the Greeks imported Egyptian substances into their pharmacopoeia, and the influence became more pronounced after the establishment of a school of Greek medicine in Alexandria.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAsclepius was espoused as the first physician, and myth placed him as the son of Apollo. Temples dedicated to the healer-god Asclepius, known as Asclepieia (Greek: ??ϫ; sing. ?? Asclepieion), functioned as centers of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.[5] At these shrines, patients would enter a dream-like state of induced sleep known as \\"enkoimesis\\" (Greek: ?۰?׻ҿ?) not unlike anesthesia, in which they either received guidance from the deity in a dream or were cured by surgery.[6] Asclepeia provided carefully controlled spaces conducive to healing and fulfilled several of the requirements of institutions created for healing.[5] The Temple of Asclepius in Pergamum had a spring that flowed down into an underground room in the Temple. People would come to drink the waters and to bathe in them because they were believed to have medicinal properties. Mud baths and hot teas such as chamomile were used to calm them or peppermint tea to soothe their headaches, which is still a home remedy used by many today. The patients were encouraged to sleep in the facilities too. Their dreams were interpreted by the doctors and their symptoms were then reviewed. Dogs would occasionally be brought in to lick open wounds for assistance in their healing. In the Asclepieion of Epidaurus, three large marble boards dated to 350 BC preserve the names, case histories, complaints, and cures of about 70 patients who came to the temple with a problem and shed it there. Some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place, but with the patient in a state of enkoimesis induced with the help of soporific substances such as opium.[6]\\r\\nThe Rod of Asclepius is a universal symbol for medicine to this day. However, it is frequently confused with Caduceus, which was a staff wielded by the god Hermes. The Rod of Asclepius embodies one snake with no wings whereas Caduceus is represented by two snakes and a pair of wings depicting the swiftness of Hermes.\\r\\nAncient Greek physicians regarded disease as being of supernatural origin, brought about from the dissatisfaction of the gods or from demonic possession.[7] The fault of the ailment was placed on the patient and the role of the physician was to conciliate with the gods or exorcise the demon with prayers, spells, and sacrifices.\\r\\nThe Hippocratic Corpus opposes ancient beliefs, offering biologically based approaches to disease instead of magical intervention. The Hippocratic Corpus is a collection of about seventy early medical works from ancient Greece that are associated with Hippocrates and his students. Although once thought to have been written by Hippocrates himself, many scholars today believe that these texts were written by a series of authors over several decades.[8] The Corpus contains the treatise, the Sacred Disease, which argues that if all diseases were derived from supernatural sources, biological medicines would not work. The establishment of the humoral theory of medicine focused on the balance between blood, yellow and black bile, and phlegm in the human body. Being too hot, cold, dry or wet disturbed the balance between the humors, resulting in disease and illness. Gods and demons were not believed to punish the patient, but attributed to bad air (miasma theory). Physicians who practiced humoral medicine focused on reestablishing balance between the humors. The shift from supernatural disease to biological disease did not completely abolish Greek religion, but offered a new method of how physicians interacted with patients.\\r\\nAncient Greek physicians who followed humorism emphasized the importance of environment. Physicians believed patients would be subjected to various diseases based on the environment they resided. The local water supply and the direction the wind blew influenced the health of the local populace. Patients played an important role in their treatment. Stated in the treatise \\"Aphorisms\\", \\"[i]t is not enough for the physician to do what is necessary, but the patient and the attendant must do their part as well\\".[9] Patient compliance was rooted in their respect for the physician. According to the treatise \\"Prognostic\\", a physician was able to increase their reputation and respect through \\"prognosis\\", knowing the outcome of the disease. Physicians had an active role in the lives of patients, taking into consideration their residence. Distinguishing between fatal diseases and recoverable disease was important for patient trust and respect, positively influencing patient compliance.\\r\\nWith the growth of patient compliance in Greek medicine, consent became an important factor between the doctor and patient relationship. Presented with all the information concerning the patient's health, the patient makes the decision to accept treatment. Physician and patient responsibility is mentioned in the treatise \\"Epidemics\\", where it states, \\"there are three factors in the practice of medicine: the disease, the patient and the physician. The physician is the servant of science, and the patient must do what he can to fight the disease with the assistance of the physician\\".[10]\\r\\nAncient Greek philosopher Aristotle was the most influential scholar of the living world from antiquity. Aristotle's biological writings demonstrate great concern for empiricism, biological causation, and the diversity of life.[11] Aristotle did not experiment, however, holding that items display their real natures in their own environments, rather than controlled artificial ones. While in modern-day physics and chemistry this assumption has been found unhelpful, in zoology and ethology it remains the dominant practice, and Aristotle's work \\"retains real interest\\".[12] He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals in the world around him, which he devoted considerable attention to categorizing. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50.\\r\\nAristotle believed that formal causes guided all natural processes.[13] Such a teleological view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design; for example suggesting that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and generally giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to manthe scala naturae or Great Chain of Being.[14]\\r\\nHe held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not foreordained by that form. Yet another aspect of his biology divided souls into three groups: a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth; a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation; and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection. He attributed only the first to plants, the first two to animals, and all three to humans.[15] Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, and like the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.[16] Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of Alcmaeon.[17] Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botanythe History of Plantswhich survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the Middle Ages. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as carpos for fruit, and pericarpion for seed vessel. Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the efficient cause. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.[18] The biological/teleological ideas of Aristotle and Theophrastus, as well as their emphasis on a series of axioms rather than on empirical observation, cannot be easily separated from their consequent impact on Western medicine.\\r\\nFollowing Theophrastus (d. 286 BC), the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.[19] It is not until the age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found. The first medical teacher at Alexandria was Herophilus of Chalcedon, who differed from Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not. He did this using an experiment involving cutting certain veins and arteries in a pig's neck until the squealing stopped.[20] In the same vein, he developed a diagnostic technique which relied upon distinguishing different types of pulse.[21] He, and his contemporary, Erasistratus of Chios, researched the role of veins and nerves, mapping their courses across the body.\\r\\nErasistratus connected the increased complexity of the surface of the human brain compared to other animals to its superior intelligence. He sometimes employed experiments to further his research, at one time repeatedly weighing a caged bird and noting its weight loss between feeding times. Following his teacher's researches into pneumatics, he claimed that the human system of blood vessels was controlled by vacuums, drawing blood across the body. In Erasistratus' physiology, air enters the body, is then drawn by the lungs into the heart, where it is transformed into vital spirit, and is then pumped by the arteries throughout the body. Some of this vital spirit reaches the brain, where it is transformed into animal spirit, which is then distributed by the nerves.[22] Herophilus and Erasistratus performed their experiments upon criminals given to them by their Ptolemaic kings. They dissected these criminals alive, and \\"while they were still breathing they observed parts which nature had formerly concealed, and examined their position, colour, shape, size, arrangement, hardness, softness, smoothness, connection.\\"[23]\\r\\nThough a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, natural theology) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. In the words of Ernst Mayr, \\"Nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.\\"[24] Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.[25]\\r\\nAelius Galenus was a prominent Greek physician, surgeon and philosopher in the Roman Empire.[26][27][28] Arguably the most accomplished of all medical researchers of antiquity, Galen influenced the development of various scientific disciplines, including anatomy,[29] physiology, pathology,[30] pharmacology,[31] and neurology, as well as philosophy[32] and logic.\\r\\nThe son of Aelius Nicon, a wealthy architect with scholarly interests, Galen received a comprehensive education that prepared him for a successful career as a physician and philosopher. Born in Pergamon (present-day Bergama, Turkey), Galen traveled extensively, exposing himself to a wide variety of medical theories and discoveries before settling in Rome, where he served prominent members of Roman society and eventually was given the position of personal physician to several emperors.\\r\\nGalen's understanding of anatomy and medicine was principally influenced by the then-current theory of humorism, as advanced by ancient Greek physicians such as Hippocrates. His theories dominated and influenced Western medical science for more than 1,300 years. His anatomical reports, based mainly on dissection of monkeys, especially the Barbary macaque, and pigs, remained uncontested until 1543, when printed descriptions and illustrations of human dissections were published in the seminal work De humani corporis fabrica by Andreas Vesalius[33][34] where Galen's physiological theory was accommodated to these new observations.[35] Galen's theory of the physiology of the circulatory system endured until 1628, when William Harvey published his treatise entitled De motu cordis, in which he established that blood circulates, with the heart acting as a pump.[36][37] Medical students continued to study Galen's writings until well into the 19th century. Galen conducted many nerve ligation experiments that supported the theory, which is still accepted today, that the brain controls all the motions of the muscles by means of the cranial and peripheral nervous systems.[38]\\r\\nGalen saw himself as both a physician and a philosopher, as he wrote in his treatise entitled That the Best Physician is also a Philosopher.[39][40][41] Galen was very interested in the debate between the rationalist and empiricist medical sects,[42] and his use of direct observation, dissection and vivisection represents a complex middle ground between the extremes of those two viewpoints.[43][44][45]\\r\\nThe first century AD Greek physician, pharmacologist, botanist, and Roman army surgeon Pedanius Dioscorides authored an encyclopedia of medicinal substances commonly known as De Materia Medica. This work did not delve into medical theory or explanation of pathogenesis, but described the uses and actions of some 600 substances, based on empirical observation. Unlike other works of Classical antiquity, Dioscorides' manuscript was never out of publication; it formed the basis for the Western pharmacopeia through the 19th century, a true testament to the efficacy of the medicines described?; moreover, the influence of work on European herbal medicine eclipsed that of the Hippocratic Corpes.[46]\\r\\nThrough long contact with omans adopted a favorable view of Hippocratic medicine.[47]\\r\\nThis acceptance led to the spread of Greek medical theories throughout the Roman Empire, and thus a large portion of the West. The most influential Roman scholar to continue and expand on the Hippocratic tradition was Galen (d. c. 207). Study of Hippocratic and Galenic texts, however, all but disappeared in the Latin West in the Early Middle Ages, following the collapse of the Western Empire, although the Hippocratic-Galenic tradition of Greek medicine continued to be studied and practiced in the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium). After AD 750, Arab, Persian and Andalusi scholars translated Galen's and Dioscorides' works in particular. Thereafter the Hippocratic-Galenic medical tradition was assimilated and eventually expanded, with the most influential Muslim doctor-scholar being (Ibn Sina). Beginning in the late eleventh century, the Hippocratic-Galenic tradition returned to the Latin West with a series of translations of the Classical texts, mainly from Arabic translations but occasionally from the original Greek. In the Renaissance, more translations of Galen and Hippocrates directly from the Greek were made from newly available Byzantine manuscripts.\\r\\nGalen's influence was so great that even after Western Europeans started making dissections in the thirteenth century, scholars often assimilated findings into the Galenic model that otherwise might have thrown Galen's accuracy into doubt. Over time, however, Classical medical theory came to be superseded by increasing emphasis on scientific experimental methods in the 16th and 17th centuries. Nevertheless, the Hippocratic-Galenic practice of bloodletting was practiced into the 19th century, despite its empirical ineffectiveness and riskiness.","field3":"What was most important element in greek medicine?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"northwestern Arizona","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Grand Canyon National Park, located in northwestern Arizona, is the 15th site in the United States to have been named a national park. The park's central feature is the Grand Canyon, a gorge of the Colorado River, which is often considered one of the Wonders of the World. The park, which covers 1,217,262 acres (1,901.972?sq?mi; 4,926.08?km2) of unincorporated area in Coconino and Mohave counties, received more than six million recreational visitors in 2017, which is the second highest count of all American national parks after Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[3] The Grand Canyon was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Grand Canyon\\" was officially designated a national park on February 26, 1919,[4] though the landmark had been well known to Americans for over thirty years prior.[5] In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited the site and said: \\"The Grand Canyon fills me with awe. It is beyond comparisonbeyond description; absolutely unparalleled through-out the wide world... Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is. Do nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness. You cannot improve on it. But what you can do is to keep it for your children, your children's children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight which every American should see.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite Roosevelt's enthusiasm and strong interest in preserving land for public use, the Grand Canyon was not immediately designated as a national park. The first bill to establish Grand Canyon National Park was introduced in 1882 by then-Senator Benjamin Harrison, which would have established Grand Canyon as the second national park in the United States after Yellowstone. Harrison unsuccessfully reintroduced his bill in 1883 and 1886; after his election to the presidency, he established the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve in 1893. Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve by proclamation on 28 November 1906,[7] and the Grand Canyon National Monument in 1908.[8] Further Senate bills to establish the site as a national park were introduced and defeated in 1910 and 1911, before the Grand Canyon National Park Act was finally signed by President Woodrow Wilson in 1919. The National Park Service, established in 1916, assumed administration of the park.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creation of the park was an early success of the conservation movement. Its national park status may have helped thwart proposals to dam the Colorado River within its boundaries. (Later, the Glen Canyon Dam would be built upriver.) In 1975, the former Marble Canyon National Monument, which followed the Colorado River northeast from the Grand Canyon to Lee's Ferry, was made part of Grand Canyon National Park. In 1979, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, Grand Canyon National Park was honored with its own coin under the America the Beautiful Quarters program.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Canyon, including its extensive system of tributary canyons, is valued for its combination of size, depth, and exposed layers of colorful rocks dating back to Precambrian times. The canyon itself was created by the incision of the Colorado River and its tributaries after the Colorado Plateau was uplifted, causing the Colorado River system to develop along its present path.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary public areas of the park are the North and South Rims of the Grand Canyon itself. The rest of the park is extremely rugged and remote, although many places are accessible by pack trail and backcountry roads. Only the Navajo Bridge near Page connects the rims by road in Arizona; this journey can take around five hours by car. Otherwise, the two rims of the Canyon are connected via the Mike O'CallaghanÿPat Tillman Memorial Bridge and the Hoover Dam.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park headquarters are at Grand Canyon Village, not far from the south entrance to the park, near one of the most popular viewpoints.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North Rim is a smaller, more remote area with less tourist activity. It is accessed by Arizona State Route 67.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South Rim is more accessible than the North Rim;[12] most visitors to the park come to the South Rim, arriving on Arizona State Route 64. The highway enters the park through the South Entrance, near Tusayan, Arizona, and heads eastward, leaving the park through the East Entrance.[12] Interstate 40 provides access to the area from the south. From the north, U.S. Route 89 connects Utah, Colorado, and the North Rim to the South Rim.[13] Overall, some 30 miles of the South Rim are accessible by road.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Canyon Village is located at the north end of U.S. Route 180, coming from Flagstaff. It is a full-service community, including lodging, fuel, food, souvenirs, a hospital, churches, and access to trails and guided walks and talks.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral lodging facilities are available along the South Rim. Hotels and other lodging include: El Tovar, Bright Angel Lodge, Kachina Lodge, Thunderbird Lodge, and Maswik Lodge, all of which are located in the village area, and Phantom Ranch, located on the canyon floor. There is also an RV Park named Trailer Village. All of these facilities are managed by Xanterra Parks & Resorts, while the Yavapai Lodge (also in the village area) is managed by Delaware North.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the North Rim there is the historic Grand Canyon Lodge[14] managed by Forever Resorts and a campground near the lodge, managed by the national park staff.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nA variety of activities at the South Rim cater to park visitors. The South Rim Drive (35 miles (56?km) is a driving tour split into two segments. The western drive to Hermit's Point is 8 miles (13?km) with several overlooks along the way, including Mohave Point, Hopi Point, and the Powell Memorial.[10] From March to December, access to Hermit's Rest is restricted to the free shuttle provided by the Park Service. The eastern portion to Desert View is 25 miles (40?km), and is open to private vehicles year round.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalking tours include the Rim Trail, which runs west from the Pipe Creek viewpoint for about 8 miles (13?km) of paved road, followed by 7 miles (11?km) unpaved to Hermit's Rest. Hikes can begin almost anywhere along this trail, and a shuttle can return hikers to their point of origin. Mather Point, the first view most people reach when entering from the South Entrance, is a popular place to begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate canyon flyovers are provided by helicopters and small airplanes out of Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Grand Canyon National Park Airport. Due to a crash in the 1990s, scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1,500 feet (460?m) of the rim within the Grand Canyon National Park.[16] Flights within the canyon are still available outside of park boundaries.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the North Rim there are few roads, however, there are some notable vehicle accessible lookout points including Point Imperial, Roosevelt Point, and Cape Royal. Mule rides are also available that go to a variety of places including several thousand feet down into the canyon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany visitors to the North Rim choose to make use of the variety of hiking trails including the Widforss Trail, Uncle Jim's Trail, the Transept Trail, and the North Kaibab Trail, the latter of which can be followed all the way down to the Colorado River, and to across to the South Kaibab Trail and the Bright Angel Trail, which continue up to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Toroweap Overlook is located in the western part of the park on the North Rim. Access is via unpaved roads off Route 389 west of Fredonia, Arizona. The roads lead through Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument and to the overlook.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US government had halted development of a 1.6 million acres area including the national park from 1966 to 2009, during the Bennett Freeze, because of an ownership dispute between Hopi and Navajo.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Canyon Association (GCA) is the National Park Service's official nonprofit partner.

Merriam-Webster list middle age from 45 to 64,[3] while prominent psychologist Erik Erikson saw it starting a little earlier and defines middle adulthood as between 40 and 65. The Collins English Dictionary, list it between the ages of 40 and 60.[4] and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - the standard diagnostic manual of the American Psychiatric Association - used to define middle age as 40 to 60, but as of DSM-IV (1994) revised the definition upwards to 45 to 65.\\r\\nThis time in the lifespan is considered to be the developmental stage of those who are between 20 years old and 40 years old. Recent developmental theories have recognized that development occurs across the entire life of a person as they experience changes cognitively, physically, socially, and in personality.[1][5]\\r\\nThis time period in the life of a person can be referred to as middle age. This time span has been defined as the time between ages 45 to 65 years old.[1][2] Many changes may occur between young adulthood and this stage.[6][7] The body may slow down and the middle aged might become more sensitive to diet, substance abuse, stress, and rest. Chronic health problems can become an issue along with disability or disease. Approximately one centimeter of height may be lost per decade.[6] Emotional responses and retrospection vary from person to person. Experiencing a sense of mortality, sadness, or loss is common at this age.[8]\\r\\nThose in middle adulthood or middle age continue to develop relationships and adapt to the changes in relationships. Changes can be the interacting with growing and grown children and aging parents. Community involvement is fairly typical of this stage of adulthood,[8] as well as continued career development.\\r\\nMiddle-aged adults may begin to show visible signs of aging.[6] This process can be more rapid in women who have osteoporosis. Changes might occur in the nervous system. The ability to perform complex tasks remains intact. Women between 48 and 55 experience menopause, which ends natural fertility.[9] Menopause can have many side effects, some welcome and some not so welcome. Men may also experience physical changes. Changes can occur to skin and other changes may include decline in physical fitness including a reduction in aerobic performance and a decrease in maximal heart rate. These measurements are generalities and people may exhibit these changes at different rates and times.\\r\\nThe mortality rate can begin to increase from 45 and onwards, mainly due to health problems like heart problems, cancer, hypertension, and diabetes.[8][10] Still, the majority of middle-aged people in industrialized nations can expect to live into old age.\\r\\nErik Erikson refers to this period of adulthood as the generatitivity-versus-stagnation stage. Persons in middle adulthood or middle age may have some cognitive loss. This loss usually remains unnoticeable because life experiences and strategies are developed to compensate for any decrease in mental abilities.[7]\\r\\nMarital satisfaction remains but other family relationships can be more difficult. Career satisfaction focuses more on inner satisfaction and contentedness and less on ambition and the desire to 'advance'.[8] Even so, career changes often can occur. Middle adulthood or middle age can be a time when a person re-examines their life by taking stock, and evaluating their accomplishments. Morality may change and become more conscious. The perception that those in this stage of development or life undergo a 'mid-life' crisis is largely false. This period in life is usually satisfying, tranquil. Personality characteristics remain stable throughout this period.[1] This may make the issue of mortality irrefutable. The relationships in middle adulthood may continue to evolve into connections that are stable.[8]","field3":"What is considered middle age in the united states?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"May 18, 2018","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"A school shooting occurred at Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas, United States, in the Houston metropolitan area, on May 18, 2018.

It is the 86th episode of the series, the ninth episode of the second part of the show's sixth season, and the 21st episode of the season overall. Written and directed by series creator, executive producer and showrunner David Chase, it first aired in the United States on June 10, 2007.\\r\\nThe plot of \\"Made in America\\" details the aftermath of the mob war between the DiMeo crime family, headed by series protagonist Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), and the New York-based Lupertazzi family. Tony also has to deal with many familial concerns involving his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), son A.J. (Robert Iler), and daughter Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler). As the series comes to a close, several characters make personal and professional adjustments.\\r\\n\\"Made in America\\" was filmed in February and March 2007, and was the only episode other than the series' pilot directed by Chase. It attracted 11.9?million viewers on its premiere date.\\r\\nThe initial critical response was mostly favorable and since the episode's original broadcast that appreciation has grown considerably, ranking it as one of the best television finales. The episode was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award and won an Emmy Award for writing and an Eddie Award for editing. \\"Made in America\\" ÿ especially its closing scene ÿ has been the subject of much discussion, criticism, and analysis. It has, like the whole series, taken a prominent place in American popular culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n* = credit only ** = photo only\\r\\nTony is in hiding with his crew. At nightfall, he meets FBI Agent Harris and gives him information about Ahmed and Muhammad. In exchange, he asks for Phil's location, but Harris says he knows nothing. Tony visits his family in the safe house where they are hiding and later joins them in attending Bobby's funeral. Tony visits Janice at her house; she tells him she will raise Bobby's children. Harris calls Tony with information that Phil has been using payphones from gas stations in Oyster Bay, Long Island, and Tony's crew begins surveilling gas stations in the area.\\r\\nPhil calls Butchie from a payphone, expresses anger about his failure to kill Tony, and rejects Butchie's suggestion to make peace. Tony meets with Butchie to negotiate without Phil's knowledge. Butchie refuses to disclose his boss' location, but agrees to a truce and tells Tony to \\"do what you gotta do\\".\\r\\nTony and his family move back into their North Caldwell home. Benny and Walden track Phil to a gas station and shoot him dead; Agent Harris is pleased by this news, seemingly because there was an FBI pool on which crime family would kill the other.\\r\\nA.J. and his girlfriend Rhiannon escape from his SUV after he left its engine running in dry leaves and let it catch fire. He takes up jogging and tells his parents he intends to join the Army. They arrange for him to work for Little Carmine's film production company, instead.\\r\\nMeadow and Patrick announce they are engaged and that Meadow may land a job at a law firm. Meadow tells Tony she wants to defend those oppressed by the government, particularly immigrants; she considers her father a victim of FBI prejudice against Italian-Americans. Tony visits the comatose Silvio in the hospital.\\r\\nCarlo goes missing; Paulie fears he may have become an informant after his son Jason was arrested on a drugs charge. Tony's lawyer, Neil Mink, tells Tony that Carlo is likely testifying and that Tony will be indicted.\\r\\nWith Carlo gone, Tony offers the leadership of the Aprile crew to Paulie. Paulie initially refuses, worrying that the crew is cursed, but accepts when Tony tells him he will offer the position to Patsy.\\r\\nJanice meets Junior in the care home to tell him of Bobby's death, but Junior is too confused to understand. Pat tells Tony he believes Janice is scheming to claim for herself the last money Junior's accountant is holding.\\r\\nTony visits Junior and tells him to give the money to Bobby's children, but realizes Junior does not recognize him. Junior reacts with surprise when Tony reminds him of his involvement in the Mafia, and Tony leaves with tears in his eyes.\\r\\nThe Sopranos arrange to meet at a diner. Tony arrives first, and watches customers come and go. Carmela arrives next, and Tony tells her Carlo will testify. A.J. then arrives and reminds his father of his advice to \\"remember the good times\\". Meadow arrives late and parks her car outside. As the bell rings, Tony looks up.\\r\\nShowrunner David Chase planned the series ending and the final scene during the 21-month hiatus between Seasons 5 and 6, a long break HBO had granted him. The final scene was filmed almost exactly as Chase had envisioned. It was not intended as a setup for a future film, although Chase later commented \\"[t]here may be a day where we all come up with something,\\" regarding a possible Sopranos feature. It was then-HBO chairman Chris Albrecht who suggested to Chase to conclude the series with the sixth season.[1][2][3]\\r\\nAs with every episode of the season, the plot outline of \\"Made in America\\" was developed by Chase and his writing staff, which for the final season consisted of executive producers Terence Winter and Matthew Weiner, and supervising producers and writing team Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider. Frequent episode director Tim Van Patten also provided Chase with some storyline suggestions.[4][5] After the episode's story had been outlined, Chase wrote the first draft. After some input from his writing staff, Chase revised the script to its finished state, although he also made minor changes during filming. \\"Made in America\\" is Chase's 30th and final official writing credit (including story credits) for the series and his ninth as sole writer of an episode.[6][7]\\r\\nChase included allusions to real-life American Mafia history and events in the script for \\"Made in America\\", something he is well known for.[6] Specifically, the line \\"Damn! We're gonna win this thing!\\", spoken in the episode by the character Dwight Harris after being informed of the death of Phil Leotardo, alludes to former FBI supervisor Lindley DeVecchio. DeVecchio famously uttered the line after being told that Lorenzo \\"Larry\\" Lampasi had been shot to death in front of his Brooklyn home and was later charged for informing the Mafia on various accounts, another parallel to Tony Soprano and Dwight Harris.[1][8][9]\\r\\nMaureen Van Zandt, who plays Gabriella Dante, is promoted to the main cast and billed in the opening credits but for this episode only. She is the final addition to the main cast of The Sopranos.\\r\\n\\"Made in America\\" was directed by Chase and photographed by Alik Sakharov. The two served in the same capacities for the pilot episode, \\"The Sopranos\\", which was filmed in 1997. The series finale marks the second time Chase has officially directed an episode of The Sopranos, although as showrunner, he would oversee the direction of most episodes throughout the show's production.[10] \\"Made in America\\" marks the 38th and final credit for Sakharov as director of photography.\\r\\nPrincipal photography commenced in late February and concluded in late March 2007. Exterior scenes and certain interior scenes of \\"Made in America\\" were filmed on location in Bergen County, New Jersey and in Brooklyn and Manhattan, New York City, New York. Additional interior scenesincluding indoor shots of the Soprano residence and the back room of the strip club Bada Bing!were filmed in a sound stage in Silvercup Studios, New York, where most such scenes of the series had been filmed. The final scene of the episode was filmed in late March 2007 at Holsten's Brookdale Confectionery, an ice cream and candy shop located in Bloomfield, New Jersey. The Bloomfield Township Council initially tried to stop HBO from filming in the town because \\"[they] found the HBO mob drama offensive to Italian-Americans\\" and voted to deny the production company a filming permit. However, as the council had no authority to stop filming in the town as long as the crew met the requirements stated in Bloomfield's code for filming crews, a permit was later issued.[11][12] As the show's producers needed to ensure that plot details of the ending would be kept a secret until the airdate, the scripts given to the crew members had their final pages removed. The final scene of these edited scripts was the one in which Tony is raking leaves outside his house, a scene that occurs 10 minutes before the real ending in the final cut. Chase received compliments for this scene from people who thought it was the real ending.[6][13]\\r\\n\\"Made in America\\" was edited by Sidney Wolinsky, one of the show's three editors, under the supervision of Chase.[10] Chase originally wanted the black screen at the end of the episode to last \\"all the way to the HBO whoosh sound,\\" meaning that no credits would roll at the end of the episode, but did not receive a waiver from the Directors Guild of America to do so.[14][15]\\r\\n\\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" is played throughout the final scene of the series. Journey's lead singer Steve Perry initially refused to let David Chase use the song until he knew the fate of the leading characters and did not give final approval until three days before the episode aired. Perry feared that the song would be remembered as the soundtrack to Tony's demise until Chase assured him that would not be the case.[16] Immediately following the airing of \\"Made in America,\\" the song enjoyed a great surge of popularity; its sales on iTunes, for example, grew 482 percent.[17] The newly growing attention to the band helped it climb out of the reportedly difficult times it was having at the time.[18]\\r\\nThe final scene of \\"Made in America\\" became the subject of much discussion, controversy, and analysis after its original broadcast. The use of an abrupt cut to black followed by several seconds of silence led many viewers to initially believe that their cable or DVR had cut out at a crucial moment.[19] Opposing interpretations soon emerged among viewers regarding the ultimate fate of series protagonist Tony Soprano, with some believing that he was killed while others believe that he remains alive.[1][20]\\r\\nOne argument for the former points to a conversation that Tony had in the midseason premiere episode \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" with his brother-in-law Bobby, in which Bobby comments on how suddenly and without sound death can happen in their lives as gangsters: \\"You probably don't even hear it when it happens, right?\\" A flashback to this scene also appears in the final minutes of \\"The Blue Comet\\", the episode preceding \\"Made in America\\".[21][22] When questioned on the theory, HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer stated that the conversation is a \\"legitimate\\" hint.[20] Also, Butchie DeConcini (the presumed successor of Phil Leotardo) was last seen saddled with reparations following the mob war. He had expressed ideas about killing Tony before (\\"Kaisha\\"), and Tony was, in the end, the very last DiMeo man left standing out of the three original Lupertazzi targets, who, Phil believed, if killed, would totally cripple the Jersey family. Hence, Tony would have been a tempting target of a hit. The final scene showing a man who glances at Tony (credited as \\"Man in Members Only Jacket\\") and who later goes to the bathroom, has been interpreted as a nod to the famous scene in The Godfather in which Michael Corleone retrieves a gun from the bathroom before shooting his enemies to death (Tony's favorite scene from the film, as revealed in the episode \\"Johnny Cakes\\").[23] Speculation has also linked the jacket of the man to the title of the opening episode of the season, \\"Members Only\\", in which Tony is shot, and also as a symbolic reference to the mysterious man's membership of the Mafia. Actor Matt Servitto said that in the script, the scene continued with the man in the Members Only jacket emerging from the bathroom and starting to walk towards Tony's table.[24] Servitto later clarified this statement, saying that he did not mean to imply that there was a completely different scripted ending, only that the \\"genius\\" editing was not what he had expected.[25]\\r\\nOther viewers offer opposing interpretations. It has been suggested that the final scene portrays that, while Tony's life is fraught with fear and danger, which could come from anyone anywhere, and that while Tony has to constantly watch his back and look out for any emerging trouble (he keeps an eye on the diner entrance), life nevertheless goes on and the viewer simply does not get to continue seeing it. The lyrics of the closing song, seemingly telling the viewer \\"Don't stop believin',\\" are thought to support this, while the silent black screen space before the credits is meant to allow people to imagine and believe in their own continuations of Tony's story.[26] It can be stated that because of Tony's peace agreement with the Lupertazzi family, their tacit sanction of a hit on Phil, and Butchie's visible unwillingness to continue the hostilities, there was little legitimate basis to expect a hit on Tony from the Lupertazzis and the threat to him, although always present, was not higher than usual.[27]\\r\\nChase has made various comments about the finale but has avoided providing an explanation to the meaning of the final scene. In his first interview after the broadcast of the finale with New Jersey paper The Star-Ledger, Chase stated,\\r\\nI have no interest in explaining, defending, reinterpreting, or adding to what is there. No one was trying to be audacious, honest to God. We did what we thought we had to do. No one was trying to blow people's minds, or thinking, \\"Wow, this'll piss them off.\\" People get the impression that you're trying to fuck with them and it's not true. You're trying to entertain them. [...] Anybody who wants to watch it, it's all there.[1]\\r\\nChase also addressed the opinion of some that the open-ended finale was insulting to the show's longtime fans:\\r\\nI saw some items in the press that said, \\"This was a huge fuck you to the audience.\\" That we were shitting in the audience's face. Why would we want to do that? Why would we entertain people for eight years only to give them the finger? We don't have contempt for the audience. In fact, I think The Sopranos is the only show that actually gave the audience credit for having some intelligence and attention span. We always operated as though people don't need to be spoon-fed every single thingthat their instincts and feelings and humanity will tell them what's going on.[2][28]\\r\\nIn an interview conducted by Brett Martin several weeks after the finale's original broadcast, Chase shared his views on the final episode and the reaction to it. On those fans of the show who demanded an unambiguous and definitive ending, Chase remarked,\\r\\nThere was so much more to say than could have been conveyed by an image of Tony facedown in a bowl of onion rings with a bullet in his head. Or, on the other side, taking over the New York mob. The way I see it is that Tony Soprano had been people's alter ego. They had gleefully watched him rob, kill, pillage, lie, and cheat. They had cheered him on. And then, all of a sudden, they wanted to see him punished for all that. They wanted \\"justice.\\" They wanted to see his brains splattered on the wall. I thought that was disgusting, frankly. [...] The pathetic thingto mewas how much they wanted his blood, after cheering him on for eight years.\\r\\nChase also made comments about the purported lack of finality in the final episode:\\r\\nThis wasn't really about \\"leaving the door open.\\" There was nothing definite about what happened, but there was a clean trend on viewa definite sense of what Tony and Carmela's future looks like. Whether it happened that night or some other night doesn't matter.\\r\\nOn the future of the Soprano children, Chase said,\\r\\nA.J.'s not going to be citizen-soldier or join the Peace Corps or try to help the world; he'll probably be some low-level movie producer. But he's not going to be a killer like his father, is he? Meadow may not be a pediatrician or even a lawyer, but she's not going to be a housewife like her mother. She'll learn to operate in the world in ways Carmela never did. [...] Tiny, little bits of progressthat's how it works.\\r\\nOn moments during and after the final scene, Chase referred to a scene from the episode \\"Stage 5\\":\\r\\nThere are no esoteric clues in there. No Da Vinci Code. Everything that pertains to that episode was in that episode. And it was in the episode before that and the one before that and seasons before this one and so on. There had been indications of what the end is like. Remember when Gerry Torciano was killed? Silvio was not aware that the gun had been fired until after Gerry was on his way down to the floor. That's the way things happen: It's already going on by the time you even notice it. [...] I'm not saying anything. And I'm not trying to be coy. It's just that I think that to explain it would diminish it.\\r\\nIn a December 2008 radio interview with Richard Belzer, Chase also mentioned the scenes from \\"Stage 5\\" and \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" in relation to the final scene.[29]\\r\\nAt the 2008 TCA Awards, held on July 22, Chase commented,\\r\\nI wasn't going to do this, but somebody said it would be a good idea if we said something about that ending. I really wasn't going to go into it, but I'll just say this...when I was going to Stanford University's graduate film school and was 23, I went to see Planet of the Apes with my wife. When it was over, I said, \\"Wow...so they had a Statue of Liberty, too.\\"[30]\\r\\nIn a November 2008 interview with Entertainment Weekly's Steve Daly, Chase stated,\\r\\n\\"There's more than one way of looking at the ending. That's all I'll say.\\"[31]\\r\\nChase revisited the final scene in an April 2015 interview with DGA Quarterly[32] and \\"suggested that fans, experts, and scholars have been over-thinking the ending to the show.\\"[33]\\r\\nThe ceiling I was going for at that point, the biggest feeling I was going for, honestly, was dont stop believing. It was very simple and much more on the nose than people think. Thats what I wanted people to believe. That life ends and death comes, but dont stop believing.\\r\\nThere are attachments we make in life, even though its all going to come to an end, that are worth so much, and were so lucky to have been able to experience them. Life is short.\\r\\nEither it ends here for Tony or some other time. But in spite of that, its really worth it. So dont stop believing.\\r\\nIn response to reports that Chase has offered a definitive answer to the question of whether Tony Soprano lived or died, at the show's conclusion,[34][35] Chase has issued denials indicating such reports were incorrect and reiterated the stance he has consistently taken on the subject, and publications have printed retractions.[36][37]\\r\\nAccording to Nielsen ratings, an average of 11.9?million viewers watched \\"Made in America\\" on its United States premiere date Sunday June 10, 2007. This was a 49%?increase from the previous episode and the show's best ratings for both parts of the sixth season. It was also the show's largest audience since the season five premiere.[38][39]\\r\\n\\"Made in America\\" received mainly favorable to semi-favorable initial reviews from critics, while early fan reception was mixed to negative, described by one critic as \\"a mixture of admiration and anger\\". During the weeks following the episode's original broadcast, \\"Made in America\\" and its closing scene in particular became the subject of much discussion and analysis. Several new interpretations and explanations of the ending were presented in magazines and on blogs, which led many critics and fans to reevaluate the ending.[2][15][19][28][40]\\r\\nMarisa Carroll of PopMatters awarded \\"Made in America\\" a score of 8 out of 10 and particularly praised the final scene as one of the best of the series.[41] Mark Farinella of The Sun Chronicle called the episode \\"[a] perfect ending to a perfect TV series.\\"[21] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called \\"Made in America\\" \\"the perfect ending\\" and wrote about the final scene, \\"On shock of that cut to black, the marvelous way it got you to roll the scene over, again and again, in your mind's eye. [sic] Rather than bringing the series to a close, that blackout made The Sopranos live forever.\\"[42] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle characterized the finale as \\"[a]n ending befitting genius of Sopranos\\" and wrote that \\"Chase managed, with this ending, to be true to reality [...] while also steering clear of trite TV conventions.\\"[43] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press called the episode \\"brilliant\\" and wrote that \\"Chase was true to himself.\\"[44] Kim Reed of Television Without Pity gave \\"Made in America\\" the highest score of A+ and praised it for staying true to the show.[45] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called the finale \\"satisfying\\" and wrote that the episode \\"fit[s] perfectly with everything Chase has done on this show before.\\"[46] Chicago Tribune critic Maureen Ryan's first review was mixed; she criticized the final scene for not providing any closure. Ryan later wrote: \\"Chase got me totally wound up, then ripped me away from that world. I was really mad at first [...] I still think what Chase did was, all due respect, kind of jerky. But minutes after the finale ended, I started laughing.\\"[47][48]\\r\\nRetrospective reviews of \\"Made in America\\" have been highly positive; the episode has been included on several lists of the best series finales of all time. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote, in an essay analyzing the finale one year after its original broadcast, that he felt the episode was \\"brilliant.\\"[40] In 2009, Arlo J. Wiley of Blogcritics wrote: \\"by focusing on that last ambiguous parting shot from creator David Chase, we run the risk of forgetting just how beautifully structured and executed an hour of television 'Made in America' is\\" and ranked it as the eighth-best series finale ever.[49] Also in 2009, Stacey Wilson of Film.com named \\"Made in America\\" one of the 10 best series finales of all time and wrote: \\"Crude, rude and no time for emotional B.S., this finale was a delicious end to a show that reveled in the ugliness of humanity.\\"[50] TV Guide included \\"Made in America\\" in their \\"TV's Best Finales Ever\\" feature, writing: \\"What's there to say about this finale that hasn't already been said? The much-anticipated closer had everyone waiting to see if Tony was finally going to go from whacker to whackee. Instead, they got Journey, a greasy plate of onion rings and a black screen. But, the fact that we're still talking about it provesfor better or worsethat the episode did its job.\\"[51]\\r\\nIn 2011, the finale was ranked #2 on the TV Guide Network special, TV's Most Unforgettable Finales.[52]\\r\\nIn 2007, \\"Made in America\\" won an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards. It was the only category the episode was nominated in. This is the third and final time series creator/executive producer David Chase has won the award for his writing of the series.[53] In 2008, Chase was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award in the category of Drama Series (Night) but lost to fellow Sopranos director Alan Taylor, who won for directing the pilot episode of Mad Men, a series created by former Sopranos writer Matthew Weiner.[54][55] Also in 2008, Editor Sidney Wolinsky won an American Cinema Editors Eddie Award in the category of Best Edited One-Hour Series for Non-Commercial Television.[56]","field3":"What ballad was featured in the last episode of the sopranos?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"12 October 1971","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nJesus Christ Superstar is a 1970 rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. The musical started as a rock opera concept album before its Broadway debut in 1971. The musical is mostly sung-through, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the Gospels' accounts of the last week of Jesus's life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus that are not present in the Bible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work's depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and the other characters. A large part of the plot focuses on the character of Judas, who is depicted as a tragic figure dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus steers his disciples and fearful for the harm that may result. Contemporary attitudes and sensibilities (as well as slang) pervade the lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional anachronisms.\\r\\n\\r\\nJudas Iscariot, a sullen member of the Twelve Apostles, expresses his concern over Jesus's rising popularity and the negative repercussions that will have. He strongly criticises Jesus for accepting his followers' unrealistic views, and for not heeding his concerns (\\"Heaven on Their Minds\\"). While Judas still loves Jesus, he believes that Jesus is just a man, not God, and worries that Jesus's following will be seen as a threat to the Roman Empire which would then severely punish Jesus, his associates, and possibly the Jewish people as a whole. Judas's warning goes unheeded, as Jesus's followers have their minds set on going to Jerusalem with Jesus. As they ask Jesus for information about his plans for the future, Jesus will not give them any, since whatever will happen is determined by God (\\"What's the Buzz?\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nRecognizing that Jesus is irritated by the badgering and lack of understanding from his followers, Mary Magdalene tries to help Jesus relax. Judas does not like how it looks, though he does not object to \\"her profession\\". It seems to Judas that Jesus is contradicting his own teaching, and he worries that this apparent lack of judgment will be used against Jesus and his followers (\\"Strange Thing Mystifying\\"). Jesus tells Judas that Mary is with him now, and unless Judas is without sin he should not judge the character of others. Jesus then reproaches the rest of the apostles for being \\"shallow, thick, and slow\\" and bitterly complains that not a single one of them truly cares if he comes or goes. Mary Magdalene tries to reassure Jesus while anointing him with oil (\\"Everything's Alright\\"). Judas angrily insists that the money spent on oil could have been used to help the poor. Sadly, Jesus answers that they simply do not have the resources to end poverty, and that they should be glad for what comforts they have, including himself; therefore, he warns him \\"You'll be lost, you'll be sorry when I'm gone.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Caiaphas, the High Priest of Israel, assembles the Pharisees together at the Sanhedrin to talk about Jesus and his disciples. According to the Pharisees, Jesus's growing following consists of Jews unwilling to accept the Romans as their rulers, and the priests believe that Jesus may come to be seen as a threat to the Roman Empire, and to the priesthood's integrity; if the Romans retaliate, many Jews will suffer, even those who are not following Jesus. Caiaphas then concludes that there could be great bloodshed and the stakes are \\"frighteningly high!\\". So, for the greater good, he suggests they should \\"crush him completely! So like John before him, this Jesus must die!\\", and the Pharisees concur upon his decision (\\"This Jesus Must Die\\"). As Jesus and his followers arrive exultantly in Jerusalem, they are confronted by Caiaphas, who demands that Jesus should postpone this parade, which Jesus says would be futile and change nothing, and he proceeds to greet the happy Israelites instead (\\"Hosanna\\"). As the crowd cheers him on, they suddenly ask, \\"Hey JC, JC, won't you die for me?\\" To this, Jesus visibly reacts with concern. Then, one of his apostles, Simon the Zealot, suggests that Jesus lead his mob in a war against Rome and gain absolute power (\\"Simon Zealotes\\"). Jesus rejects this suggestion, stating that none of his followers understand what true power is, nor do they understand his true message (\\"Poor Jerusalem\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nPontius Pilate, the governor of Judea, has had a dream, in which he meets with a Galilean (in the form of Jesus) and that he, Pilate, will receive all of the blame for the man's violent and mournful death, predicting the rise of Christianity (\\"Pilate's Dream\\"). Jesus arrives at the Temple in Jerusalem and finds that it has become a haven of sin and debauchery as it is being used for selling everything from usury and weapons to prostitutes and drugs; angered by this, Jesus drives everyone out (\\"The Temple\\"). Angry, disconsolate, and tired by his burden, Jesus is confronted by lepers, cripples, and beggars, all wanting to be healed. Even though he heals some, their number increases, and he is overwhelmed. Unable to solve everyone's problems, Jesus screams \\"Heal yourselves!\\" until he finds Mary Magdalene by his side, laying him to rest (\\"Everything's Alright (Reprise)\\"). While Jesus is asleep, Mary acknowledges that she is unconditionally in love with Jesus, unlike any man she has known before, and it frightens her (\\"I Don't Know How to Love Him\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nConflicted, Judas seeks out the Pharisees and promises to help them arrest Jesus, while belaboring that he is acting with unselfish motives and that Jesus himself would approve if he knew those motives (\\"Damned for All Time\\"). Sustaining his testimony, Caiaphas and Annas ask that Judas reveal the location of Jesus so that the authorities can apprehend him. In exchange for the information, Judas is offered thirty pieces of silver as a \\"fee\\" so that he can assuage his conscience by using the money charitably (\\"Blood Money\\"). Judas decides that it would be better to turn Jesus in before his popularity leads to the deaths of Jesus and his followers, Judas included. He reveals that on Thursday night, Jesus will be at the Garden of Gethsemane.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt what Jesus knows will be the Last Supper, he pours wine and passes bread for his apostles (\\"The Last Supper\\"). Very aware of the ordeal he faces, he is stung when the others pay little attention to him; \\"For all you care this wine could be my blood / For all you care this bread could be my body,\\" he remarks, alluding to (and anticipating) the Christian doctrine of the Eucharist. He asks them to remember him when they eat and drink; he predicts that Peter will deny him three times \\"in just a few hours\\" and that one of them will betray him. Judas, believing that Jesus already knows (\\"cut the dramatics, you know very well who\\"), admits he is the one and angrily accuses Jesus of acting recklessly and egotistically. Claiming he does not understand Jesus's decisions, he leaves to bring the Roman soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remaining apostles fall asleep, and Jesus retreats to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray (\\"Gethsemane\\"). He admits to God his doubts, fears, and anger; that he is tired and has done all he can. He asks powerfully if any of it has meaning and implores God not let him suffer the horrible death that portends for him. He feels disillusioned with his quest as the Messiah, does not understand what it has achieved, and wishes to give up. Receiving no answer, Jesus realises that he cannot defy God's will, and surrenders to God. His prayer ends with a request that God take him immediately, \\"before I change my mind.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, Judas arrives with Roman soldiers and identifies Jesus by kissing him on the cheek (\\"The Arrest\\"). While Jesus is being arrested, his apostles attempt to fight the soldiers, Jesus tells them to let the soldiers take him to Caiaphas. On the way, a mob (acting likeand sometimes represented asmodern-day news reporters) asks Jesus what he plans to do, but Jesus declines to comment. When Jesus is brought to trial before the Sanhedrin, Caiaphas demands if he is the King of the Jews. Jesus responds: \\"That's what you say, you say that I am.\\" This answer is affirmative according to Jewish custom, and that provides enough justification for the Pharisees to bring Jesus to Pilate. Meanwhile, Jesus's apostle Peter is confronted by an old man, a soldier and a maid, and Peter denies to each that he knows Jesus (\\"Peter's Denial\\"). Mary asks Peter why he denied Jesus, and Peter responds that he had to do it in order to save himself. Mary wonders how Jesus knew that Peter would deny him three times.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, Pilate asks Jesus if he is the King of the Jews. Jesus gives the same answer that he gave Caiaphas: \\"that's what you say.\\"[1] Since Jesus is from Galilee, Pilate says that he is not under his jurisdiction and sends him to King Herod (\\"Pilate and Christ\\"). As Jesus is dragged away, the chorus asks where Jesus's power has gone. The decadent and flamboyant King Herod attempts to persuade Jesus into proving his divinity by performing miracles, offering to free him if he complies (\\"King Herod's Song (Try It And See)\\"), but Jesus ignores him. Herod decides that Jesus is just another phony messiah and angrily sends him back to Pilate. Meanwhile, Mary Magdalene, Peter, and the apostles remember when they first began following Jesus, and wish that they could return to a time of peace (\\"Could We Start Again, Please?\\")[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, Judas is horrified upon beholding Jesus's harsh treatment by the authorities. Wracked with guilt, Judas expresses regret to the pharisees, fearing he will forever be remembered as a traitor. Caiaphas and Annas assure him that what he has done now will save everyone and that he should not feel remorse for his actions. Although rewarded for a job well done, Judas recognizes that God chose him to be the one to betray Jesus, and that he has been used as a pawn for the \\"foul bloody crime\\". He curses God for manipulating him, and in a final attempt to detach himself from his destiny, he commits suicide by hanging himself from a tree (\\"Judas's Death\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Jesus's trial, Pilate interrogates Jesus into revealing the whereabouts of his kingdom, but was cut off by a bloodthirsty mob who demands that Jesus should be sentenced to death by crucifixion. In spite of the mobs behavior,[3] Pilate remembers the dream he had about the mob and the unjust execution of Jesus. Pilate tells the mob that, while Jesus should be imprisoned, he does not deserve to die. Pilate demands that the crowd give him a reason to condemn Jesus, and the mob answers that Jesus is a blasphemer and has defied the Roman Empire. However, after revealing Jesus as nothing more than a pathetic human being, Pilate calls the crowd hypocrites, as he knows they hate Roman rule. Even so, he decides to satisfy their bloodlust by having Jesus flogged, counting thirty-nine bloody strokes (\\"Trial Before Pilate, (Including The Thirty-Nine Lashes)\\"). Pilate, clearly disturbed by the whole ordeal, pleads with Jesus to defend himself, but Jesus says weakly that everything has been determined, by God, and Pilate cannot change it. More outraged by Jesus's words, the crowd still calls for Jesus's death, informing Pilate that he has his duty to keep the peace. Finally, he reluctantly agrees to crucify Jesus to keep the crowd from getting violent, saying to Jesus: \\"Dont let me stop your great self-destruction! Die if you want to, you misguided martyr! I wash my hands of your demolition! Die if you want to, you ÿ innocent puppet....\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Jesus's crucifixion awaits, he is haunted by the ghost of Judas, who taunts him and questions why Jesus chose to arrive in the manner and time that he did, and if what happened to him was really part of a divine plan, but Judas' questions go unanswered (\\"Superstar\\"). After reciting his final words and commending his spirit to God, Jesus slowly dies on the cross (\\"The Crucifixion\\"). In the end, the Apostles and Mary, mourning the death of their fallen saviour, reflect on the impact he has had on their lives (\\"John Nineteen: Forty-One\\").[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n2 flutes, clarinet, 2 bassoons, 2 saxophones (one tenor), 6 horns, 4 trumpets, 2 trombones, drum set, percussion set, 6 guitars (1 acoustic, 2 electric, 4 bass), 5 pianos, electric piano, 3 organs, positive organ, and strings. Additional vocals are provided by a choir, a children's choir (\\"Overture\\"), and other singers (\\"Superstar\\").[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAct One\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAct Two\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe songs were first written and conceived as a concept album, before the musical was created and staged.[6] On the original album, the part of Jesus was sung by Ian Gillan, with Murray Head as Judas, Michael d'Abo as King Herod, Yvonne Elliman as Mary Magdalene, and Barry Dennen as Pilate. In July 1971, the first authorised American concert of the rock opera took place in front of an audience of 13,000 people at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's Civic Arena with Jeff Fenholt singing the role of Jesus, Carl Anderson as Judas and Elliman repeating as Mary Magdalene.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical opened on Broadway on 12 October 1971, directed by Tom O'Horgan, at the Mark Hellinger Theatre. It starred Jeff Fenholt as Jesus, Ben Vereen as Judas and Bob Bingham as Caiaphas. Dennen and Elliman played the roles[which?] that they had sung on the album. Kurt Yaghjian was Annas.[citation needed] Anderson replaced Vereen when he fell ill, and the two performers later took turns playing the role. The show closed on 30 June 1973 after 711 performances. The production received mixed reviews; \\r\\nthe bold casting of African-Americans as Judas was lauded, but reviewer Clive Barnes from The New York Times said, \\"the real disappointment was not in the music ... but in the conception.\\"[8][9]  The show was nominated for five Tony Awards, including Best Score, but won none. Lloyd Webber won a Drama Desk Award as \\"Most Promising Composer\\", and Vereen won a Theatre World Award.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Broadway show and subsequent productions were condemned by some religious groups. Tim Rice was quoted as saying \\"It happens that we don't see Christ as God but simply the right man at the right time at the right place.\\"[10][11] Some Christians considered such comments to be blasphemous, the character of Judas too sympathetic and some of his criticisms of Jesus offensive.[12] At the same time, some Jews claimed that it bolstered the antisemitic belief that the Jews were responsible for Jesus' death by showing most of the villains as Jewish (Caiaphas and the other priests, Herod) and showing the crowd in Jerusalem calling for the crucifixion.[13][14] The musical was banned in South Africa for being \\"irreligious\\".[15] A 1972 production of the play was banned in the Hungarian People's Republic for \\"distribution of religious propaganda\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuperstar opened at the Palace Theatre in London in 1972, starring Paul Nicholas as Jesus, Stephen Tate as Judas and Dana Gillespie as Mary Magdalene. It was directed by Australian Jim Sharman. This production was much more successful than the original production on Broadway, running for eight years and becoming the United Kingdom's longest-running musical at the time. Dmitri Shostakovich attended this production in London just before his death. He regretted that he could not have composed something like it; he lauded especially a rock band underpinning full symphonic strings, brass and woodwind.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the earliest foreign productions was a five-day run in Sweden at Scandinavium in Gothenburg, opening on 18 February 1972 and playing to 74,000 people (a record at the time). Starring as Mary Magdalene was Agnetha F?ltskog. On 16 March 1972 an oratorio version was performed at Memorial Drive Park in Adelaide, South Australia as part of the Adelaide Festival of the Arts.[18] This was followed in May by the first full Australian production, at the Capitol Theatre, Sydney, later moving to the Palais Theatre in Melbourne.[19] Sharman again directed, and the cast included Trevor White as Jesus, Jon English as Judas, and Michele Fawdon (1972ÿ1973) and Marcia Hines (1973ÿ1974) as Mary Magdalene. Hines was the first black woman to play the role. Other cast members included Reg Livermore, John Paul Young, Stevie Wright, and Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock, who met during the production and subsequently formed the band Air Supply. The production ran until February 1974.[citation needed] In June 1972 the show opened in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in Atelje 212 theatre, in adaptation by Jovan ?irilov.[20] The role of Jesus Christ was played by Korni Grupa vocalist Zlatko Pejakovi?, the role of Mary Magdalene by Azra Halinovi? and the role of Pontius Pilate by Branko Mili?evi?.[20] The premiere was directly broadcast by Radio Television of Belgrade.[20] Bora ?or?evi? and Sr?an Marjanovi?, at the time little known musicians, also participated as members of the choir.[21][22] The production was praised by the Yugoslav public.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1973, the show opened in Paris at the Thatre de Chaillot in a French adaptation by Pierre Delano?. The title role was sung by Daniel Beretta, and Mary Magdalena was Anne-Marie David. The critics were unimpressed, and the production stopped after 30 performances.[citation needed] In the same year, Noel Pearson produced the show at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, Republic of Ireland, with Luke Kelly giving a critically acclaimed performance as King Herod.[23] In 1974, first Spanish-language production ran in Mexico with the title \\"Jesucristo Super Estrella\\". Julissa played Mary Magdalen. The musical was seen in 1974 in Peru and Singapore.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Stigwood launched two road touring companies in 1971 to cover North America, with Robert Corff and Tom Westerman as Jesus, respectively.[citation needed] The first major US National Tour, however began In 1976, managed by Laura Shapiro Kramer. The tour continued until 1980. In 1977, the show had its first Broadway revival, running from 23 November 1977 to 12 February 1978. It was directed by William Daniel Grey, with choreography by Kelly Carrol and starred William Daniel Grey as Jesus, Patrick Jude as Judas, and Barbara Niles as Mary Magdalene.[25] Regional productions followed.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1981, Emilio de Soto directed an English-language version in Venezuela, with 163 actors.[citation needed] From 1982 to 1984, an Australian production toured Australia and South-East Asia, directed by Trevor White, who also reprised his role of Jesus. The cast included Doug Parkinson as Judas and Marcia Hines (reprising her role as Mary Magdalene).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American touring revival of Superstar in 1992 starred Neeley and Anderson reprising their respective Broadway and 1973 film roles as Jesus and Judas, receiving positive reviews for their performances. This production also starred both Dennis DeYoung as Pilate, and Syreeta and Irene Cara sharing Mary Magdalene. Originally expected to run for three to four months, the tour ended up running for five years. Replacements in this tour included Jason Raize as Pontius Pilate and Simone as the Maid by the Fire and understudy for Mary. In 1994, a New Zealand production starred Darryl Lovegrove as Jesus, Jay Laga'aia as Judas and Frankie Stevens as Caiaphas. Also in 1994, a stage version titled Jesus Christ Superstar: A Resurrection was performed in Atlanta, Austin and Seattle featuring Amy Ray as Jesus, Emily Saliers as Mary Magdalene and Michael Lorant as Judas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, the musical was revived in London at the Lyceum Theatre and ran for a year and a half. Directed by Gale Edwards, it starred Steve Balsamo and Zubin Varla as Jesus and Judas, and Joanna Ampil as Mary Magdalene and Alice Cooper as King Herod. The production was nominated for a Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival but did not win. It was followed by a UK tour. This production was revived on Broadway at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts in 2000, starring Glenn Carter as Jesus and Tony Vincent as Judas. It opened to mixed reviews and ran for 161 performances.[26] It was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical but did not win. In 2002, a national tour starred Sebastian Bach as Jesus and Anderson once again as Judas. Bach received mixed reviews while Anderson was again praised. In April 2003, Bach was replaced by Eric Kunze. Anderson left the show later in 2003 after being diagnosed with leukaemia and died in 2004. The tour closed shortly after Anderson's departure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004 a year-long UK tour began, directed by Bob Tomson and Bill Kenwright. Carter reprised his role as Jesus, with James Fox as Judas. In 2005, a successful Scandinavian tour starred Australian Peter Murphy (Jesus), American Kristen Cummings (Mary), Englishman Jon Boydon ne Stokes (Judas), Frenchman Jr?me Pradon (King Herod) and Australian Michael-John Hurney (Pilate). A US tour starring Neeley, reprising his role as Jesus and Corey Glover as Judas, began in 2006 and played for five years. A Chilean heavy metal version has played annually in Santiago since 2004.[27] In Boston, Gary Cherone portrayed Jesus in productions in 1994, 1996 and 2003 and Judas in 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new production of Jesus Christ Superstar was mounted at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, in Stratford, Ontario, in 2011. Directed by Des McAnuff, the cast starred Paul Nolan as Jesus, Josh Young as Judas, Brent Carver as Pilate, Chilina Kennedy as Mary Magdalene, Bruce Dow as Herod and Melissa O'Neil as Martha. This moved to La Jolla Playhouse later in the year and transferred to the Neil Simon Theatre on Broadway in 2012, with Tom Hewitt taking over the role of Pilate.[28] Reviews were mixed.[29][30] The revival was nominated for two Tonys: Best Revival and, for Young, Best Actor.[31] Neither award was won, but Young won a Theatre World Award. The revival closed after 116 performances and 24 previews.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough a 2012 ITV competition TV show called Superstar, produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber, the UK public chose Ben Forster for the role of Jesus in an arena tour of the musical, beginning at O2 in September 2012.[33][6] The production also starred Tim Minchin as Judas, Melanie C as Mary Magdalene and Chris Moyles as King Herod.[34] Lloyd Webber stated, \\"The funny thing is that Jesus Christ Superstar [as a rock concert] is what we actually intended it to be. When it is done in a conventional proscenium theatre production it feels shoe-horned in. That is why I wanted to do this.\\"[6] The tour resumed in March 2013 in the UK, and an Australian leg of the tour commenced in Perth in May 2013.[35] Andrew O'Keefe played King Herod in Australia, with Jon Stevens as Pilate. Stevens had played Judas in an Australian arena tour in 1992.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, celebrating 45 years since the musical debuted on Broadway, Jesus Christ Superstar returned to London at Regent's Park Open Air Theatre, directed by Timothy Sheader. The production won the BBC Radio 2 Audience Award for Best Musical at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards,[38] and a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival.[39] The production returned to the Open Air Theatre as part of the 2017 season, running from 11 August 2017 to 23 September.[40]  Additionally, the Lyric Opera of Chicago hosted a run of the opera from late April 2018 to late May 2018.  [41]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo notable Jesuses were Takeshi Kaga, in the 1976 Japanese production, and Camilo Sesto in the 1975 Spanish production[why?]. Mary Magdalene was Roco Banquells in a 1981 production in Mexico. A Czech version premiered in 1994 in Prague's Spirla Theatre and ran until 1998, with 1288 performances.[42] In the 2000s, a Venezuelan production ran for two years (2006ÿ2008), directed by Michel Hausmann. A Spanish production produced by Stage Entertainment ran from 2007 to 2009, followed by long-running productions in Italy and Sweden (featuring Ola Salo) and Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerts of the show have been mounted in Vienna, Austria, since 1981, including one on Easter of 2015 starring Drew Sarich in the title role.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, an Australian production presented by Harvest Rain Theatre Company was directed by Tim O'Connor. Luke Kennedy appeared as Jesus, Naomi Price as Mary, Tod Strike as Judas, and Steven Tandy as Herod. A 2017 Professional Australian Production was staged at the Arts Centre Melbourne and starred Rob Mills as Jesus.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2014 production in S?o Paulo, Brazil starred Igor Rickli as Jesus. Negra Li was Mary Magdalene.[44] A 2014 production in Lima, Peru, at the Sarita Colonia prison, as part of a rehabilitation program for inmates, received some press.[45] Eighty prisoners mounted the production, directed by inmate Freddy Battifora, who also played the role of Jesus.[46] The Catholic Church approved of the production.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original 1970 concept album was very popular; its 1971 release topped the US Billboard Pop Albums.[47] The 1972 and 1992 Australian cast recordings were also both highly successful.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1994, a studio recording under the name of Jesus Christ Superstar: A Resurrection was released.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1996 radio production for BBC Radio 2 starred Tony Hadley as Jesus, Roger Daltrey as Judas, Frances Ruffelle as Mary Magdalene and Julian Clary as King Herod; this production was re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 6 August 2016.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2018, Aztec Records released a 1973 live recording of the Australian production; previous recordings of that production were released as \\"bootleg\\" copies.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nA film adaptation of Jesus Christ Superstar was released in 1973 and was the eighth highest-grossing film of that year. The film, directed by Norman Jewison, was shot in Israel[51] and other Middle Eastern locations. Ted Neeley, Carl Anderson and Yvonne Elliman were each nominated for a Golden Globe Award for their portrayals of Jesus, Judas and Mary Magdalene, respectively. Bob Bingham (Caiaphas) and Barry Dennen (Pilate) also reprised their roles. Though it attracted criticism from some religious groups, the film was generally well received.[citation needed] A new song, called \\"Then We Are Decided\\" and phrased as a dialogue between Caiaphas and Annas, was written and composed for this adaptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA second adaptation was filmed in 1999, and released around the world on video in 2000 and 2001.[52] It starred Glenn Carter as Jesus, Jr?me Pradon as Judas, Rene Castle as Mary Magdalene, and Rik Mayall as Herod, and was directed by Gale Edwards and Nick Morris. It was released on video in the UK in October 2000.[53] In the U.S. it was released on VHS and DVD in March 2001, and aired on PBS's Great Performances series in April 2001.[54]  It won the International Emmy Award for Best Performing Arts Film in November 2001.[55] The style of the film is more like the stage version than the location-based 1973 adaptation, and it used many of the ideas from the 1996ÿ1999 UK production.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Easter Sunday, April 1, 2018, NBC aired a live concert version of the show featuring John Legend as Jesus, Sara Bareilles as Mary Magdalene, Brandon Victor Dixon as Judas, Alice Cooper as King Herod, Norm Lewis as Caiaphas, Ben Daniels as Pilate, Jin Ha as Annas, Erik Gr?nwall as Simon Zealotes and Jason Tam as Peter.[56]","field3":"When did jesus christ superstar open on broadway?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Each team consists of 12 players, making it 24 in total","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The National Basketball Association All-Star Game is a basketball exhibition game hosted every February by the National Basketball Association (NBA), matching a mix of the league's star players from the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference. Each team consists of 12 players, making it 24 in total. It is the featured event of NBA All-Star Weekend. NBA All-Star Weekend is a three-day event which goes from Friday to Sunday. The All-Star game was first staged at the Boston Garden on March 2, 1951.\\r\\nThe starting lineup for each squad is selected by a combination of fan, player, and media voting,[1] while the reserves are chosen by a vote among the head coaches from each squad's respective conference.[2] Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players. If a selected player is injured and cannot participate, the NBA commissioner selects a replacement. The vote leaders for each conferences are assigned as captains and can choose from a pool of players named as all-stars to form their teams. The newly formed teams will also play for a charity of choice to help the games remain competitive.[3]\\r\\nThe head coach of the team with the best record in each conference is chosen to lead their respective conference in the All-Star Game, with a prohibition against repeat appearances.[2] Known as the \\"Riley Rule\\", it was created after perennially successful Los Angeles Lakers head coach Pat Riley earned the right to coach the Western Conference team eight times in nine seasons between 1982 and 1990. The coach of the team with the next best record serves instead.\\r\\nThe 2017 All-Star weekend was originally awarded to Charlotte, North Carolina. On March 23, 2016, North Carolina passed House Bill 2 as a remedy to Charlotte Ordinance 7056. This led to the NBA threatening to pull the game from Charlotte if the bill was not repealed or revised so as to not discriminate against the LGBT community. The NBA announced on July 21, 2016 that the game would be moved from Charlotte to New Orleans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of holding an All-Star Game was conceived during a meeting between NBA President Maurice Podoloff, NBA publicity director Haskell Cohen and Boston Celtics owner Walter A. Brown. At that time, the basketball world had just been stunned by the college basketball point-shaving scandal.\\r\\nIn order to regain public attention to the league, Cohen suggested the league to host an exhibition game featuring the league's best players, similar to Major League Baseball's All-Star Game.[4] Although most people, including Podoloff, were pessimistic about the idea, Brown remained confident that it would be a success, and he even offered to host the game and to cover all the expenses or potential losses incurred from the game.[5] In the first All-Star Game, the Eastern All-Stars team defeated the Western All-Stars team 111ÿ94.\\r\\nBoston Celtics' Ed Macauley was named as the first NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player, and the All-Star Game became a success, drawing an attendance of 10,094, much higher than that season's average attendance of 3,500.[6] In 2010, the NBA All Star Game attendance record was set when 108,713 fans jammed Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. This shattered the existing attendance record previously held at Ford Field on Dec. 13, 2003 when 78,129 attendees watched Michigan State play Duke.[7]\\r\\nOn October 3, 2017, the NBA and NBPA announced the changes to the NBA All-Star Game format starting with the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. The vote leaders for each conferences will be assigned as team captains and will be able to select players from the rest of the starters and the reserves, regardless of the conference they play in, to form their own teams. This marks the first time, the conferences will not play against each other since the inaugural All-Star game.[3]\\r\\nThe starting five from each conference consists of three frontcourt players and two guards, selected by a combination of fan, player, and media voting. In 2017, the NBA moved from a pure fan vote to a weighted process wherein fan voting accounts for 50% of the total and player and media voting account for 25% each.[8] The league made the change in response to social media campaigns that resulted in mediocre players such as journeyman Zaza Pachulia nearly being voted as All-Star starters over more deserving players.[9], [10] Prior to 2013, fans selected two forwards and one center instead of generic frontcourt players.[11] The NBA in 2003 began offering All-Star ballots in three languagesEnglish, Spanish and Chinesefor fan voting of the starters.[12]\\r\\nNBA coaches vote for the reserves for their respective conferences, none of which can be players on their own team. Each coach selects two guards, three frontcourt players and two wild cards, with each selected player ranked in order of preference within each category. If a multi-position player is to be selected, coaches are encouraged to vote for the player at the position that is \\"most advantageous for the All-Star team\\", regardless of where the player is listed on the All-Star ballot or the position he is listed in box scores.[13] If a player is unavailable for the game due to injury, the NBA commissioner selects a replacement for the roster. If the replacement is for a fan-selected starter, the all-star coach chooses the replacement in the starting lineup, and is not limited to the commissioner's addition to the roster.[14] It is also possible for more than one All-Star to be selected from one team, but there has never been more than 4 All-Stars represent a team in the game. Most recently was the 2017 Golden State Warriors who had 4 players represent that team (Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson.) This has only occurred 8 times dating back to 1962 Boston Celtics and the 1962 Los Angeles Lakers.[15]\\r\\nThe Game is played under normal NBA rules, but there are notable differences from an average game. Since the starting All-Stars are selected by fan vote, players sometimes start the game at atypical positions. For instance, in 2007 Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady had the two highest fan vote totals among Western Conference guards. As both players normally play shooting guard, Bryant, who is 6'6\\" (198?cm), started the game as a point guard, despite him also manning the shooting guard position on his team.\\r\\nThe player introductions are usually accompanied by a significant amount of fanfare, including lighting effects, dance music, and pyrotechnics. Special uniforms are designed for the game each year, usually red for the Western Conference and blue for the Eastern Conference, but the 1997ÿ2002 games allowed players the opportunity to wear their respective team uniforms, and until 2009 and from 2015 to the present, the host conference wore light uniforms. Originally players from the same team who share a number have the option to either keep or change numbers (e.g. Patrick Ewing trading his familiar #33 for #3 because of Larry Bird wearing the same number), but since 1997 players from the same team can keep their customary uniform numbers even if they share them. A major recording artist typically sings \\"O Canada\\" and \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" prior to tipoff. One of the more memorable performances was given by Marvin Gaye during the 1983 game; Gaye was accompanied by Gordon Banks, who played a tape from an all night session that used numerous elements of soul music and funk, and Banks still has that historic tape of the music to which Gaye sang his soulful version.\\r\\nGameplay usually involves players attempting spectacular slam dunks and alley oops. Defensive effort is usually limited and the final score of the game is generally much higher than an average NBA game. The coaches also try to give most of the reserve players some time on the court instead of using a limited rotation as they would in a normal game, but giving the starters more minutes because that's who the fans want to see most. The fourth quarter of the game is often played in a more competitive fashion, if the game is close.\\r\\nHalftime is also longer than a typical NBA game due to musical performances by popular artists. Recent guests have included Michael Jackson, Snoop Dogg, Ariana Grande, Elton John, Beyonc, Mariah Carey, OutKast, Alicia Keys, Shakira, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Kendrick Lamar, Christina Aguilera, and John Legend.\\r\\nThis is a list of each All-Star Game, the venue at which it was played, and the Game MVP. Parenthesized numbers indicate multiple times that venue, city, or player has occurred as of that instance (e.g. \\"Michael Jordan (2)\\" in 1996 indicates that was his second All-Star MVP award). As of the 2017 All-Star Game (the 2016ÿ17 NBA season)[update], the Eastern Conference leads with a record of 37 wins and 29 losses. The Western Conference has won the last 3 games.\\r\\nNote: Stadium names are named based on the name at the day of the All-Star Game.\\r\\nThe All-Star Game is the featured event of All-Star Weekend, and it is held on a Sunday night. All-Star Weekend also includes a number of popular exhibition games and competitions featuring NBA players and alumni as well as players from the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) and NBA G League (G League).","field3":"How many players make the nba all star team?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Yogi Adityanath of the Bharatiya Janata Party","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP), a North Indian state, is the head of the Government of Uttar Pradesh.

Brown,[5] suggested that a tradition developed around the \\"Johannine Community\\", and that this tradition gave rise to the gospel.[6] The discovery of a large number of papyrus fragments of manuscripts with Johannine themes has led more scholars to recognize that the texts were among the most influential in the early Church.[7]\\r\\nThe discourses contained with this gospel seem to be concerned with issues of the churchÿsynagogue debate at the time of composition.[8] It is notable that in John, the community appears to define itself primarily in contrast to Judaism, rather than as part of a wider Christian community.[Notes 3] Though Christianity started as a movement within Judaism, it gradually separated from Judaism because of mutual opposition between the two religions.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gospel of John can be divided into four sections: a prologue (1:1ÿ18), a Book of Signs (1:19ÿ12:50), a Book of Glory (13:1ÿ20:31), and an epilogue (21).[10] The structure is highly schematic: there are seven \\"signs\\" culminating in the raising of Lazarus (foreshadowing the resurrection of Jesus), and seven \\"I am\\" sayings and discourses, culminating in Thomas's proclamation of Jesus as \\"my lord and my God\\"the same title (dominus et deus) claimed by Roman Emperor Domitian.[11]\\r\\nJesus is placed in his cosmic setting as the Logos made flesh who reveals God and gives salvation to believers; John the Baptist, Andrew, and Nathanael bear witness to him as the Lamb of God, the Son of God, and the Christ.[12]\\r\\nThe narrative of Jesus' public ministry, beginning with the introduction of the first disciples of Jesus. It consists of seven miracles, or \\"signs\\", interspersed with long dialogues, discourses, \\"Amen, amen\\" sayings, and \\"I Am\\" sayings, culminating with the raising of Lazarus from the dead. In John it is this, and not the cleansing of the Temple, that prompts the authorities to have Jesus executed. The seven signs consist of Jesus' miracle at the wedding at Cana, his healing the royal official's son, his healing the paralytic at Bethesda, his feeding the 5,000, his walking on water, his healing the man born blind, and his raising Lazarus from the dead. Other incidents recounted in this segment of the gospel include the cleansing of the Temple; Jesus' conversation with the Pharisee Nicodemus, wherein he explains the importance of spiritual rebirth; his conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well, wherein he gives the Water of Life Discourse; the Bread of Life Discourse, which prompted many of his disciples to leave; the Woman Taken in Adultery; Jesus' claims to be the Light of the World; Jesus' answer to Pilate; the Good Shepherd pericope; Jesus' rejection by the Jews; the Jesus wept; the plot to kill Jesus; the anointing of Jesus; Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem; the prediction of the glorification of the Son of Man; and the prediction of the Last Judgment.\\r\\nThe narrative of Jesus' Passion, Resurrection, and post-Resurrection appearances. The Passion narrative opens with an account of the Last Supper that differs significantly from that found in the synoptics, with Jesus washing the disciples' feet instead of ushering in a new covenant of his body and blood.[13] This is followed by Jesus' Farewell Discourse, an account of his betrayal, arrest, trial, death, burial, post-Resurrection appearances,[Notes 4] and final commission for his followers. It also includes Peter's denial, the institution of the New Commandment and the New Covenant, the promise of the Paraclete, the allegory of the True Vine, the High Priestly Prayer, the ut omnes unum sint, the What is truth?, Jesus' mocking and crowning with thorns, the Ecce homo, the discovery of the empty tomb, the noli me tangere, the Great Commission, and the incredulity of Thomas. The section ends with a conclusion on the purpose of the gospel: \\"that [the reader] may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe narrative of Jesus' post-Resurrection appearance to his disciples by the lake, the miraculous catch of fish, the prophecy of the crucifixion of Peter, the restoration of Peter, and the fate of the Beloved Disciple.[12] A majority of scholars believes this chapter to be an addition to the gospel.[14]\\r\\nThe Gospel of John is anonymous. Traditionally, Christians have identified the author as \\"the Disciple whom Jesus loved\\" mentioned in John 21:24,[15] who is understood to be John son of Zebedee, one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles. These identifications, however, are rejected by many modern biblical scholars.[1][16][Notes 5] Nevertheless, the author of the fourth Gospel is sometimes called John the Evangelist, often out of convenience since the definitive name of the author is still debated.\\r\\nJohn is usually dated to AD 90ÿ110.[17][Notes 6] It arose in a Jewish Christian community in the process of breaking from the Jewish synagogue.[18] Scholars believe that the text went through two to three redactions, or \\"editions\\", before reaching its current form.[19][20]\\r\\nJohn, which regularly describes Jesus' opponents simply as \\"the Jews\\", is more consistently hostile to \\"the Jews\\" than any other body of New Testament writing.[21][Notes 7] Historian and former Roman Catholic priest James Carroll states: \\"The climax of this movement comes in chapter 8 of John, when Jesus is portrayed as denouncing 'the Jews' who were gathered at the Temple as the offspring of Satan.\\"[22] In John 8:44 Jesus tells the Jews: \\"You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him.\\" In 8:38 and 11:53, \\"the Jews\\" are depicted as wishing to kill Jesus. However, Carroll cautions that this and similar statements in the Gospel of Matthew and the 1 Thessalonians should be viewed as \\"evidence not of Jew hatred but of sectarian conflicts among Jews\\" in the early years of the Christian church.[23]\\r\\nAs noted by New Testament scholar Obrey M. Hendricks, Jr.: \\"Although its scathing portrayal of the Jews has opened John to charges of anti-Semitism, a careful reading reveals 'the Jews' to be a class designation, not a religious or ethnic grouping; rather than denoting adherents to Judaism in general, the term primarily refers to the hereditary Temple religious authorities.\\"[24] In later centuries, John was used to support anti-Semitic polemics, but the author of the gospel regarded himself as a Jew, championed Jesus and his followers as Jews, and probably wrote for a largely Jewish community.[25][26]\\r\\nRudolf Bultmann, in a seminal work published in 1941, argued that John's sources were a hypothetical \\"Signs Gospel\\" listing Christ's miracles, a revelation discourse, and a passion narrative. Bultmann's work, combined with that of other scholars (the work of Raymond E. Brown was particularly influential in the English-speaking world), led to a scholarly consensus in the second half of the 20th century that the Gospel of John was independent of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, known as the synoptic gospels. This agreement broke down in the last decade of the century, and there are now many scholars who believe that John did know the synoptics, especially Mark, while the hypothesis of a \\"signs\\" source has been increasingly undermined.[27]\\r\\nBut theories of either complete independence of or complete dependence on the synoptics are largely rejected in current scholarship: on the one hand, elements such as distinctive Johannine language, the lengthy discourses, and the prologue on the Logos, are clearly unique to John; on the other, John clearly shares a multitude of episodes with the other three.[28]\\r\\nThe most important sources used by the evangelist were the Jewish scriptures (the Tanakh, more or less identical with the Christian Old Testament), probably in the Greek translation. John quotes from them directly, references important figures from them, and uses narratives from them as the basis for several of the discourses. But the author was also familiar with non-Jewish sources: the Logos of the prologue (the Word that is with God from the beginning of creation) derives from both the Jewish concept of Lady Wisdom and from the Greek philosophers, while John 6 alludes not only to the exodus but also to Greco-Roman mystery cults, while John 4 alludes to Samaritan messianic beliefs.[29]\\r\\nChapters 19 and 21 of John hint that \\"the Disciple whom Jesus loved\\", or \\"the Beloved Disciple\\", was an eyewitness to Jesus' ministry, but the majority of scholars are cautious of accepting this at face value.[30][31] With the exception of the \\"Johannine Thunderbolt\\" passages,[Notes 8] the teachings of Jesus found in the synoptic gospels are very different from those recorded in John, and since the 19th century some scholars have argued that these discourses in Johannine style are less likely to be historical, and more likely to have been written for theological purposes.[33]\\r\\nScholars usually agree that John is not entirely without historical value.[34] It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior to that of the synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.[34]\\r\\nRylands Library Papyrus P52, a Greek papyrus fragment with John 18:31ÿ33 on one side and 18:37ÿ38 on the other, commonly dated to the first half of the 2nd century, is the oldest New Testament manuscript known.[35] A substantially complete text of John exists from the beginning of the 3rd century at the latest, so that the textual evidence for this gospel is commonly accepted as both earlier and more reliable than that for any other. John stands fourth in the standard ordering of the gospels, after Matthew, Mark and Luke.\\r\\nThe Gospel of John presents a \\"high Christology,\\" depicting Jesus as divine, and yet, according to some interpretations, subordinate to the one God.[36] However, in his Summa Theologiae, Thomas Aquinas flatly rejects any denial of equality among the persons of the Trinity, including denials based on Johannine passages.[37][Notes 9] John's gospel gives more focus to the relationship of the Son to the Father than the synoptics, as seen in chapter 17 of the gospel.\\r\\nIn the synoptics, Jesus speaks often about the Kingdom of God; his own divine role is obscured (see Messianic Secret). In John, Jesus talks openly about his divine role. He echoes the Father's own statement of identity, i.e. \\"I Am Who I Am\\", with several \\"I Am\\" declarations that also identify him with symbols of major significance.[39] He says \\"I am\\":\\r\\nIn the prologue, John identifies Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, the term logos meant the principle of cosmic reason. In this sense, it was similar to the Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.[39]\\r\\nThe opening verse of John is translated as \\"the Word was with God and the Word was God\\" in all \\"orthodox\\" English Bibles.[Notes 10] There are alternative views. The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures of Jehovah's Witnesses has \\"The Word was with God, and the Word was a god.\\" The Scholars Version of the gospel, developed by the Jesus Seminar, loosely translates the phrase as \\"The Logos was what God was,\\" offered as a better representation of the original meaning of the evangelist.[40]\\r\\nThe portrayal of Jesus' death in John is unique among the four Gospels. It does not appear to rely on the kinds of atonement theology indicative of vicarious sacrifice (cf. Mk 10:45, Rom 3:25) but rather presents the death of Jesus as his glorification and return to the father. Likewise, the three \\"passion predictions\\" of the Synoptic Gospels (Mk 8:31, 9:31, 10:33ÿ34 and pars.) are replaced instead in John with three instances of Jesus explaining how he will be exalted or \\"lifted up\\"(Jn 3:14, 8:28, 12:32). The verb for \\"lifted up\\" reflects the double entendre at work in John's theology of the cross, for Jesus is both physically elevated from the earth at the crucifixion but also, at the same time, exalted and glorified.[41]\\r\\nAmong the most controversial areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and on the degree of importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one of these questions do not always correspond to their answer to the other.[42]\\r\\nAccording to Rudolf Bultmann, there are three sacramental allusions: one to baptism (3:5), one to the Eucharist (6:51ÿ58), and one to both (19:34). He believed these passages to be later interpolations, though most scholars now reject this assessment. Some scholars on the weaker-sacramental side of the spectrum deny that there are any sacramental allusions in these passages or in the gospel as a whole, while others see sacramental symbolism applied to other subjects in these and other passages. Oscar Cullmann and Bruce Vawter, a Protestant and a Catholic respectively, and both on the stronger-sacramental end of the spectrum, have found sacramental allusions in most chapters. Cullmann found references to baptism and the Eucharist throughout the gospel, and Vawter found additional references to matrimony in 2:1ÿ11, anointing of the sick in 12:1ÿ11, and penance in 20:22ÿ23. Towards the center of the spectrum, Raymond Brown is more cautious than Cullmann and Vawter but more lenient than Bultmann and his school, identifying several passages as containing sacramental allusions and rating them according to his assessment of their degree of certainty.[42]\\r\\nMost scholars on the stronger-sacramental end of the spectrum assess the sacraments as being of great importance to the evangelist. However, perhaps counterintuitively, some scholars who find fewer sacramental references, such as Udo Schnelle, view the references that they find as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to Docetist anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, James Dunn views the absence of a Eucharistic institution narrative as evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against a conception of eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.[42]\\r\\nIn comparison to the synoptic gospels, the Fourth Gospel is markedly individualistic, in the sense that it places emphasis more on the individual's relation to Jesus than on the corporate nature of the Church.[42][43] This is largely accomplished through the consistently singular grammatical structure of various aphoristic sayings of Jesus throughout the gospel.[42][Notes 11] According to Richard Bauckham, emphasis on believers coming into a new group upon their conversion is conspicuously absent from John.[42] There is also a theme of \\"personal coinherence\\", that is, the intimate personal relationship between the believer and Jesus in which the believer \\"abides\\" in Jesus and Jesus in the believer.[43][42][Notes 12] According to C. F. D. Moule, the individualistic tendencies of the Fourth Gospel could potentially give rise to a realized eschatology achieved on the level of the individual believer; this realized eschatology is not, however, to replace \\"orthodox\\", futurist eschatological expectations, but is to be \\"only [their] correlative.\\"[44] Some have argued that the Beloved Disciple is meant to be all followers of Jesus, inviting all into such a personal relationship with Christ. Beyond this, the emphasis on the individual's relationship with Jesus in the Gospel has suggested its usefulness for contemplation on the life of Christ.[45]\\r\\nJohn's account of the Baptist is different from that of the synoptic gospels. In this gospel, John is not called \\"the Baptist.\\"[46] The Baptist's ministry overlaps with that of Jesus; his baptism of Jesus is not explicitly mentioned, but his witness to Jesus is unambiguous.[46] The evangelist almost certainly knew the story of John's baptism of Jesus and he makes a vital theological use of it.[47] He subordinates the Baptist to Jesus, perhaps in response to members of the Baptist's sect who regarded the Jesus movement as an offshoot of their movement.[13]\\r\\nIn John's gospel, Jesus and his disciples go to Judea early in Jesus' ministry before John the Baptist was imprisoned and executed by Herod. He leads a ministry of baptism larger than John's own. The Jesus Seminar rated this account as black, containing no historically accurate information.[40] According to the biblical historians at the Jesus Seminar, John likely had a larger presence in the public mind than Jesus.[48]\\r\\nAlthough not commonly understood as Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully argued that the Gospel of John has elements in common with Gnosticism.[13] Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it.[49] To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it.[50] Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown have argued that the pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.[51]\\r\\nComparisons to Gnosticism are based not in what the author says, but in the language he uses to say it, notably, use of the concepts of Logos and Light.[52] Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown, have argued that the ancient Jewish Qumran community also used the concept of Light versus Darkness. The arguments of Bultmann and his school were seriously compromised by the mid-20th-century discoveries of the Nag Hammadi library of genuine Gnostic writings (which are dissimilar to the Gospel of John) as well as the Qumran library of Jewish writings (which are often similar to the Gospel of John).[53]\\r\\nGnostics read John but interpreted it differently from the way non-Gnostics did.[54] Gnosticism taught that salvation came from gnosis, secret knowledge, and Gnostics did not see Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge.[55] Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.[56]\\r\\nRaymond Brown contends that \\"The Johannine picture of a savior who came from an alien world above, who said that neither he nor those who accepted him were of this world,[57] and who promised to return to take them to a heavenly dwelling[58] could be fitted into the gnostic world picture (even if God's love for the world in 3:16 could not).\\"[59] It has been suggested that similarities between John's gospel and Gnosticism may spring from common roots in Jewish Apocalyptic literature.[60]\\r\\nThe Gospel of John is significantly different from the synoptic gospels, with major variations in material, theological emphasis, chronology, and literary style.[61] There are also some discrepancies between John and the synoptics, some amounting to contradictions.[61]\\r\\nJohn lacks scenes from the synoptics such as Jesus' baptism,[62] the calling of the Twelve, exorcisms, parables, the Transfiguration, and the Last Supper. Conversely, it includes scenes not found in the synoptics, including Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Cana, the resurrection of Lazarus, Jesus washing the feet of his disciples, and multiple visits to Jerusalem.[61]\\r\\nIn the fourth gospel, Jesus' mother Mary, while frequently mentioned, is never identified by name.[63][64] John does assert that Jesus was known as the \\"son of Joseph\\" in 6:42. For John, Jesus' town of origin is irrelevant, for he comes from beyond this world, from God the Father.[65]\\r\\nWhile John makes no direct mention of Jesus' baptism,[62][61] he does quote John the Baptist's description of the descent of the Holy Spirit as a dove, as happens at Jesus' baptism in the synoptics. Major synoptic speeches of Jesus are absent, including the Sermon on the Mount and the Olivet Discourse,[66] and the exorcisms of demons are never mentioned as in the synoptics.[62][67] John never lists all of the Twelve Disciples and names at least one disciple, Nathanael, whose name is not found in the synoptics. Thomas is given a personality beyond a mere name, described as \\"Doubting Thomas\\".[68]\\r\\nJesus is identified with the Word (\\"Logos\\"), and the Word is identified with theos (\\"god\\" in Greek);[69] no such identification is made in the synoptics.[70] In Mark, Jesus urges his disciples to keep his divinity secret, but in John he is very open in discussing it, even referring to himself as \\"I AM\\", the title God gives himself in Exodus at his self-revelation to Moses. In the synoptics the chief theme is the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Heaven (the latter specifically in Matthew), while John's theme is Jesus as the source of eternal life and the Kingdom is only mentioned twice.[61][67] In contrast to the synoptic expectation of the Kingdom (using the term parousia, meaning \\"coming\\"), John presents a more individualistic, realized eschatology.[71][72][Notes 13]\\r\\nIn the synoptics, the ministry of Jesus takes a single year, but in John it takes three, as evidenced by references to three Passovers. Events are not all in the same order: the date of the crucifixion is different, as is the time of Jesus' anointing in Bethany, and the cleansing of the temple occurs in the beginning of Jesus' ministry rather than near its end.[61]\\r\\nIn the synoptics, quotations from Jesus are usually in the form of short, pithy sayings; in John, longer quotations are often given. The vocabulary is also different, and filled with theological import: in John, Jesus does not work \\"miracles\\" (Greek: Ѵ??ך?, translit.?dynmeis, sing. Ѵ????, dynamis), but \\"signs\\" (Greek: ך??, translit.?smeia, sing. ך?, smeion) which unveil his divine identity.[61] Most scholars consider John not to contain any parables.[74] Rather it contains metaphorical stories or allegories, such as those of the Good Shepherd and of the True Vine, in which each individual element corresponds to a specific person, group, or thing. Some scholars, however, find some such parables as the short story of the childbearing woman (16:21) or the dying grain (12:24).[Notes 14]\\r\\nAccording to the synoptics, the arrest of Jesus was a reaction to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus.[61] The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, even go so far as to be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.[75]\\r\\nThe gospel has been depicted in live narrations and dramatized in productions, skits, plays, and Passion Plays, as well as in film. The most recent such portrayal is the 2014 film 'The Gospel of John', directed by David Batty and narrated by David Harewood and Brian Cox, with Selva Rasalingam as Jesus. The 2003 film The Gospel of John, was directed by Philip Saville, narrated by Christopher Plummer, with Henry Ian Cusick as Jesus.\\r\\nParts of the gospel have been set to music. One such setting is Steve Warner's power anthem \\"Come and See\\", written for the 20th anniversary of the Alliance for Catholic Education and including lyrical fragments taken from the Book of Signs. Additionally, some composers have made settings of the Passion as portrayed in the gospel, most notably the one composed by Johann Sebastian Bach, although some verses are borrowed from Matthew.[76]\\r\\nOnline translations of the Gospel of John:","field3":"When did john write the gospel of john?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Frederick Douglass","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Major party African American candidates for President of the United States could not run in primaries until nearly the third quarter of the 20th century, after the passage of the Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act (1965) opened up political participation to blacks in the South. In addition, party changes to give more weight to candidates' performance in primaries, rather than to party leaders' negotiation in secret, opened up the fields. In 2008, Senator Barack Obama was elected the 44th president of the United States, the first African American to win the office.\\r\\nThis article is only about major party candidates who completed full campaigns. Third party candidates and those of major parties who dropped out of the primary process early, can be found at List of African American United States presidential and vice presidential candidates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1888 Frederick Douglass was invited to speak at the Republican National Convention. Afterward during the roll call vote, he received one vote, so was nominally a candidate for the presidency. In those years, the candidates for the presidency and vice presidency were chosen by state representatives voting at the nominating convention. Many decisions were made by negotiations of state and party leaders \\"behind closed doors.\\" Douglass was not a serious candidate in contemporary terms.\\r\\nIn 1904, George Edwin Taylor was president of the National Negro Democratic League.[1] Southern Democrats were enacting laws that disfranchised most Black voters and were imposing segregation through Jim Crow laws. Northern Democrats seemed unwilling and/or unable to control the excesses of their Southern parties. The National Negro Democratic League was fractured by the debate over the issue of linking the nations currency to silver as well as to gold. By 1904, Taylor was positioned to abandon the party and bureau that he had led as president for two terms. It was not a good time to be a Black Democrat. It also was a time when lynching was creeping northward and when scientific racism was gaining acceptance within the nations intellectual and scientific community (see Nadir of race relations).\\r\\nJudge Taylor made that change in 1904 when the executive committee of the newly formed National Negro Liberty Party asked him to become their candidate for the office of president of the United States.[2] That party had its origin in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1897 when it was known as the Ex-Slave Petitioners Assembly. It was one of several leagues or assemblies that had formed at the end of the century to support bills then working their way through the United States Congress to grant pensions to former slaves.[3] These leagues claimed that membership in a league was required to qualify for a pension, if and when Congress passed such a bill. In 1900, that Assembly reorganized as the National Industrial Council and in 1903 added issues of lynching, Jim Crow laws, disfranchisement, anti-imperialism and scientific racism to its agenda, broadening its appeal to Black voters in Northern and Midwestern states. In 1904 the Council moved its headquarters to Chicago, Illinois and reorganized as the National Negro Civil Liberty Party.[4]\\r\\nThe first national convention of that new party convened in St. Louis, Missouri in July 1904, with plans to field candidates in states that had sizeable Black populations. Its platform included planks that dealt with disfranchisement, insufficient career opportunities for Blacks in the United States military, imperialism, public ownership of railroads, self-government for the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.), lynching, and pensions for ex-slaves. The convention also selected Col. William Thomas Scott of East St. Louis, Illinois as its candidate for the office of president of the United States for the 1904 election and William C. Payne a little-known teacher from Warrenton Virginia as his vice presidential running mate. The 37-year-old Payne who later founded an industrial school in Puerto Rico, served as a Cabin Steward on the USS Dixie during the Spanish-American War.[5][6] When convention delegates had left St. Louis and when Scott was arrested and jailed for having failed to pay a fine imposed in 1901, the partys executive committee turned to Taylor (who had just stepped down as president of the National Negro Democratic League) to lead the partys ticket.[7]\\r\\nTaylors campaign in 1904 was unsuccessful. The partys promise to put 300 speakers on the stump to support his candidacy and its plan to field 6,000 candidates for local offices failed to materialize. No newspaper supported the party. State laws kept the party from listing candidates officially on election ballots. Taylors name failed to be added to any state ballot. The votes he received were not recorded in state records. William Scott later estimated that the party had received 65,000 votes nationwide, a number that could not be verified.[8]\\r\\nIn 1972, Shirley Chisholm was the first African-American major party candidate for president. She was a candidate for the Democratic Party nomination and participated in the Democratic primaries in numerous states.[9] She campaigned in 12 states and won 28 delegates.[10] In the actual balloting at the 1972 Democratic National Convention, she gained additional votes from disaffected Democrats and ended with 152 delegates.[9]\\r\\nIn the 1984 presidential election and 1988 presidential election, Jesse Jackson was the first major party black candidate to run nationwide primary campaigns. He also competed as a Democrat.[11] In 1984, he garnered around 3 million votes in the primaries and in 1988, around 7 million.\\r\\nIn 1992 Alan Keyes was the first African-American candidate to run in the Republican presidential primaries.[citation needed] Keyes participated again, unsuccessfully, in 1996, 2000, and 2008. In 2004, Carol Moseley Braun and Al Sharpton were unsuccessful candidates in the Democratic primaries. \\"Tea Party\\" Republican Herman Cain staged a run for the presidency in 2012, and received a brief surge of attention and popularity, but withdrew before any primaries were held. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson ran for the Republican nomination in the 2016 election and surged in the polls for a time in late 2015, but withdrew after the first Super Tuesday.\\r\\nSenator Obama was identified as a potential candidate for president of the U.S. after his eloquent speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.[12] The distinct possibility of an African American becoming elected was realized as the Democratic primary elections got under way in early 2008. Barack Obama emerged as a serious contender for the nomination[13] and was the first African American to win the nomination of a major party in a United States presidential election. As the Democratic Party's nominee he went on to win the general election on November 4, 2008. On January 20, 2009 he was sworn in as the first African American president of the United States. He was re-elected to a second term as president on November 6, 2012.\\r\\nThe implications of his victory were discussed during the race, and one focus included the effect on race relations,[14] American society[15] and federal politics. The discussions took place in political circles, on cable news by pundits and professionals, in print journalism, academia, and on the blogosphere.[citation needed] Analysts addressed his heritage and cultural identification, his strong emphasis on family, academic training, community work, and two decades in an active faith community.\\r\\nThe results of African-American presidential campaigns have ranged from winning the presidency to ending before primary voting began. However, all of the candidates have had a political impact by making sure their voices were a part of the national debate and gaining some attention from their partys establishment. Chisholm paved the way for African American and female candidates. Her goal was to make the Democratic Party more responsive to the people. When describing her reasons for running Chisholm said, I am not the candidate of black America, although I am black and proud. I am not the candidate of the womens movement of this country, although I am a woman, and I am equally proud of thatI am the candidate of the people of America.[16] In the 1972 primary, Chisholm won more than 430,000 votes[17] in fourteen states and 28 delegates at the Democratic Convention in Miami.[18] Chisholm provided a boost to George McGovern, the eventual Democratic nominee, when she campaigned for him after the convention. Chisholms candidacy inspired many women and African Americans to make a difference in politics.[19] As the first African American and woman to run for the nomination of a major party, Chisholm paved the way for Jesse Jackson Sr. who would be the next major African American candidate to run. For future candidates, Chisholm advised, the next campaign by a woman or black must be well prepared, and well financed; it must be planned long in advance, and it must aim at building a new coalition.[20]\\r\\nJackson seemed to follow Chisholms advice in his 1984 run for president. His 1984 campaign sought to bring together a Rainbow Coalition of African Americans, Hispanics, the poor, the elderly, family farmers, and women that would challenge the conservative policies of president Ronald Reagan.[21] Jackson placed third out of ten candidates for the Democratic nomination with more than 3 million primary votes.[22] He won primaries or caucuses in four states and the District of Columbia. Jacksons campaign made enormous progress by building on Chisholms legacy. His 1984 campaign registered nearly 2 million voters of all racial backgrounds.[23] By registering so many new voters, Jackson expanded the Democratic Partys base. He also inspired African American voters. Exit polls showed that nearly 12% of all Black voters were participating for the first-time.[24] Jacksons campaign won him a speaking slot at the 1984 Democratic Convention, which provided a national platform for him to present his agenda.[25] In his 1988 campaign, Jackson increased his support to 6.9 million primary votes and won 9 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.[26]\\r\\nSharpton and Moseley Braun followed Jacksons campaign when they ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. Moseley Braun, having already made history as the only African American woman elected to the United States Senate, became the most visible female candidate to run for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination. She advocated for expanding opportunity and encouraged women to seek positions of power. Now is the time for Democrats to renew hope that we will leave [the American Dream] for the next generation in even better shape than we found it, Moseley Braun said, And a woman can lead the way.[27] Though Moseley Braun ended her campaign in January 2004, she earned a speaking slot at the Democratic Convention in Boston where she had a national platform to advocate for equal rights.[28]\\r\\nSharptons 2004 campaign also focused on equal rights. In describing why he was running, Sharpton said,  I think if we stand up for workers rights, stand up for a peace plan worldwide, stand up for the constitutional rights of every American, those people will come back [to the Democratic Party], and those people are the majority of Americans.[29] Like Moseley Braun, Sharptons campaign allowed him to participate in the early nationally televised Democratic Party primary debates, and earned him a speaking slot at the 2004 Democratic Convention, the same year future president Barack Obama gained national attention for his convention speech.\\r\\nOn the Republican side, Keyes first ran for the nomination in 1996 seeking to force his party to focus on social issues such as abortion. Keyes garnered a lot of free media during this campaign.[30] The number of primary votes Keyes received increased from his 1996 campaign (471,716) to his 2000 campaign (914,548) but his vote total decreased in his 2008 primary run (58,977).[31]\\r\\nAfrican American presidential candidates have a variety of reasons for joining the race. Some candidates run to because they think they can win. Others run to influence the national debate by advocating for specific policy proposals. African American candidates seek to inspire their community to participate in the electoral process and hold elected officials accountable. Some run for a combination of these reasons.[32] Above all, African Americans run, like all candidates, to make their voices heard. Regardless of their reasons for running, these candidates have broken down barriers for other African Americas, Latino, and women. In less than four decades, African American presidential candidates have increased their support from Chisholm winning 430,000 primary votes to Obama being elected president with more than 69 million.\\r\\nVarious commentators have suggested a president could be recognized as the \\"first black president of the United States\\" for their contributions to the well-being of African Americans.\\r\\nToni Morrison labeled Democrat Bill Clinton the first black president of the United States.[33][34][35] Morrison suggested that Clinton was \\"blacker than any actual black person who could ever be elected in our children's lifetime.\\"[36] Author and professor Angela Dillard stated such claims constituted a \\"silly and defeatist notion\\" that separated the black community.[37]","field3":"Who was the first african american presidential candidate nominated?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"precisely halfway between blue and green","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Aqua (from Latin: aqua for water) is a greenish-blue color, a variation of the color cyan.

It is accredited through FCIS and SACS - AdvancED.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960 Dr. Milton Brutten, an expert in dyslexia, led the way in education for students who learn differently when he partnered with Dr. Henry Evans, and founded The Vanguard School in suburban Philadelphia. The private school was one of the first in the country to identify and serve children with learning disabilities.\\r\\nBy 1966, The Vanguard School Residential Program expanded to Lake Wales, Florida with six students at Bon Aire Lodge on Lake Pierce.\\r\\nFrom 1968-69 The Vanguard School acquired 75 acres of property on US Highway 27 in Lake Wales, and began the initial construction of the Upper School and other amenities. By 1971, the campus was consolidated to the Highway 27 location where it currently is today.\\r\\nIn 1975, The Vanguard School was accredited by the Florida Council of Independent Schools. The Vanguard School of Lake Wales, Florida was incorporated as an Independent Florida Non-Profit Organization, and was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools by 1983.\\r\\nIn 2004, the school sustained a direct hit from three hurricanes within a span of six weeks. From 2006-10, dormitories, classrooms, the dining hall, and administration building were overhauled during campus-wide renovations. That year, the class of 2010 was the largest in the history of Vanguard, with a total of 42 graduating seniors.\\r\\nThe Vanguard School later built a Performing Arts Center and began a campus-wide beautification project in 2016. State-of-the-art security was implemented in 2016 as well.[1]\\r\\nVanguard School is a private education facility for children with neurologically based learning differences. Those differences include: ADHD, ADD, High Functioning Autism (Asperger's), Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, and Dysgraphia. [2] The Vanguard School is not a therapeutic school. Vanguard provides individualized and differentiated instruction for each student. Differentiation of instruction is accomplished by identifying the performance levels of each student within the construct of curriculum standards for each class.\\r\\nThe premise is all lessons begin at the students instructional level and move toward mastery of the standards by utilizing specific teaching strategies that will foster student growth and achievement in relationship to the required competencies.\\r\\nConcurrently, differentiation of instruction and accommodations within each class are observed where one student may be asked to perform an assignment or task that requires comprehension with teacher prompts with a mastery of 80%, while another student is asked to perform an assignment that requires analysis of given information independently with a mastery of 90%. This process is successful when instructors understand the needs of each student. The Vanguard School uses medical and psychological information provided by licensed practitioners through parents to identify appropriate accommodations. Vanguard's faculty employs many different strategies to accommodate students in the areas of presentation of material, (how the student will access information); response (how the student will demonstrate competence of instructional material); setting (where the student will be instructed and assessed); and scheduling (time needed to instruct, respond and for assessment/testing).\\r\\nIncoming students are assessed to identify their reading level. Classes are designed to improve reading fluency through decoding skills, and development of automaticity with respect to the sound-symbol relationships. Once students become more fluent readers, the focus shifts to comprehension strategies specifically designed for students with reading disorders.\\r\\nLanguage development, technology use, self-management, executive functioning, and social and emotional regulation are supported and addressed as \\"teachable moments\\" within The Vanguard School's academic programs. The school also provides assistance with students who struggle with language. There is a Social Skills Communication class available and is taught by a part-time Speech and Language Pathologist.\\r\\nDuring a student's time at The Vanguard School, they are assigned both an academic and residential mentor. Student mentors are direct points of contact for parents. Mentors also provide structure and accountability for students. In each grade, there is an individualized plan for each student so that they are getting the attention needed to facilitate their learning difference(s). Upon entering their senior year (12th grade) at The Vanguard School, each student must have a complete Transition Plan in place. A Transition Plan is for when the student leaves The Vanguard School's campus upon graduation. This plan is formed with the principal, College and Career Adviser, the student's mentor(s), and parents. Once this Transition Plan is implemented then the student attends their Transition Plan meeting. This is to ensure that each and every student has goal upon graduation, whether it is going to college, technical school, military, a residential program, or the work force.\\r\\nThere are different levels of boarding. There are day students who live off campus with their families but commute to the campus for classes. Day Student Tuition is $24,500. Five Day Boarders live on campus during the week but live off campus during the weekend. Five Day Tuition is $41,200. Then there are the full-time boarding students. These students live on campus seven days a week. Boarding Student Tuition is $47,200.\\r\\nThere are four dormitories: West Hall, Boyd Hall, Berry Hall, and Sabbagh. The dormitories are separated into female and male. West and Berry Hall are the boy dorms and Sabbagh and Boyd are the girls dorms. The dorms are on opposite sides of the Vanguard campus. The residential staff provides around-the-clock supervision in accordance with student age and social maturity. Students participate in a variety of diverse cultural and social events in a regulated environment.\\r\\nThe Vanguard School sits on a 77-acre campus with four dorms, three school buildings, a media center/library, cafeteria, gym, fitness center, performing arts center, and infirmary with medical staff. There is lake access, a greenhouse, and a citrus grove.\\r\\nThe Vanguard School offers students a wide range of after-school clubs, trips, sports, and activities. Student leadership and community involvement is offered through a variety of community service clubs and activities. Clubs and activities are changed periodically so that students may give input into new interests and ideas.\\r\\nThe Activity Department of the Vanguard School offers several trips/activities for students on a prepaid basis. These can include: Disney World, Sea World, Universal, Ziplining, camping, the zoo, museums, paintball, etc.\\r\\nThe Vanguard School is a Division 2A School and a member of the Florida High School Athletic Association.

Located in the City of Westminster, although no longer the principal residence of the monarch, it is the ceremonial meeting place of the Accession Council and the London residence of several members of the royal family.\\r\\nBuilt by King Henry VIII on the site of a leper hospital dedicated to Saint James the Less, the palace was secondary in importance to the Palace of Whitehall for most Tudor and Stuart monarchs. The palace increased in importance during the reigns of the early Georgian monarchy, but was displaced by Buckingham Palace in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. After decades of being used increasingly for only formal occasions, the move was formalised by Queen Victoria in 1837. Today the palace houses a number of official offices, societies and collections and all ambassadors and high commissioners to the United Kingdom are still accredited to the Court of St James's.\\r\\nMainly built between 1531 and 1536 in red-brick, the palace's architecture is primarily Tudor in style. A fire in 1809 destroyed parts of the structure, including the monarch's private apartments, which were never replaced. Some 17th-century interiors survive, but most were remodelled in the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe palace was commissioned by Henry VIII, on the site of a former leper hospital dedicated to Saint James the Less.[n 1] The new palace, secondary in the king's interest to Henry's Whitehall Palace, was constructed between 1531 and 1536 as a smaller residence to escape formal court life.[2] Much smaller than the nearby Whitehall, St James's was arranged around a number of courtyards, including the Colour Court, the Ambassador's Court and the Friary Court. The most recognisable feature is the north gatehouse; constructed with four storeys, the gatehouse has two crenellated flanking octagonal towers at its corners and a central clock dominating the uppermost floor and gable; the clock is a later addition, and dates from 1731.[3] It is decorated with the initials H.A. for Henry and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. Henry constructed the palace in red brick, with detail picked out in darker brick.[2]\\r\\nThe palace was remodelled in 1544, with ceilings painted by Hans Holbein, and was described as a \\"pleasant royal house\\".[4] Two of Henry VIII's children died at Saint James's, Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset[5] and Mary I.[6] Elizabeth I often resided at the palace, and is said to have spent the night there while waiting for the Spanish Armada to sail up the Channel.[4]\\r\\nIn 1638, Charles I gave the palace to Marie de Medici, the mother of his wife Henrietta Maria. Marie remained in the palace for three years, but the residence of a Catholic former queen of France proved unpopular with parliament and she was soon asked to leave for Cologne. Charles I spent his final night at St James's before his execution.[1] Oliver Cromwell then took it over, and turned it into barracks during the English Commonwealth period. Charles II, James II, Mary II and Anne were all born at the palace.[1]\\r\\nThe palace was restored by Charles II following the demise of the Commonwealth, laying out St James's Park at the same time. It became the principal residence of the monarch in London in 1698, during the reign of William III and Mary II after Whitehall Palace was destroyed by fire, and became the administrative centre of the monarchy, a role it retains.\\r\\nThe first two monarchs of the House of Hanover used St James's Palace as their principal London residence. George I and George II both housed their mistresses, the Duchess of Kendal and the Countess of Suffolk respectively, at the palace.[1] In 1757, George II donated the Palace library to the British Museum;[7] this gift was the first part of what later became the Royal Collection.[8] In 1809, a fire destroyed part of the palace, including the monarch's private apartments at the south east corner. These apartments were not replaced, leaving the Queen's Chapel in isolation, and Marlborough Road now runs between the two buildings.[citation needed]\\r\\nGeorge III found St James's increasingly unsuitable. The Tudor palace was regarded as uncomfortable and too cramped for his ever-growing family. In 1762 George purchased Buckingham House?ÿ the predecessor to Buckingham Palace?ÿ for his queen, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz [9] The royal family began to spend the majority of their time at Buckingham House, with St James's being used for only the most formal of occasions; thrice-weekly leves and public audiences were still held there. In the late 18th century, George III refurbished the state apartments but neglected the living quarters.[10] Queen Victoria formalised the move in 1837, ending St James's status as the primary residence of the monarch. It was nevertheless where Victoria married her husband, Prince Albert, in 1840, and where, eighteen years later, Victoria and Albert's eldest child, Princess Victoria, married her husband, Prince Frederick of Prussia.[1]\\r\\nFor most of the time of the personal union between Great Britain (later the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) and the Electorate of Hanover from 1714 until 1837 the ministers of the German Chancery were working in two small rooms within St James's Palace.[citation needed]\\r\\nSecond Round Table Conference (September ÿ December 1931) pertaining to Indian independence was held here. On 12 June 1941, Representatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and of the exiled governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia, as well as General de Gaulle of France, met and signed the Declaration of St James's Palace which was the first of six treaties signed that established the United Nations and composed the Charter of the United Nations.[11]\\r\\nSt James's Palace is still a working palace, and the Royal Court is still formally based there, despite the monarch residing elsewhere. It is also the London residence of the Princess Royal; Princess Beatrice of York; Princess Eugenie of York; and Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy. The palace is used to host official receptions, such as those of visiting heads of state, and charities of which members of the royal family are patrons. The Palace forms part of a sprawling complex of buildings housing Court offices and officials' apartments. The immediate palace complex includes York House, the former home of the Prince of Wales and his sons, Princes William and Harry. Lancaster House located next-door, is used by HM Government for official receptions, and the nearby Clarence House, the former home of the Queen Mother is now the residence of the Prince of Wales.[12]\\r\\nThe nearby Queen's Chapel, built by Inigo Jones, adjoins St James's Palace. While the Queen's Chapel is open to the public at selected times, the Chapel Royal in the palace is not accessible to the public. They both remain active places of worship.[12]\\r\\nThe offices of the Royal Collection Department, the Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps, the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Chapel Royal, the Gentlemen at Arms, the Yeomen of the Guard and the Queen's Watermen are all housed at St James's Palace. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the Royal Philatelic Collection has been housed at St James's Palace, after spending the entire 20th century at Buckingham Palace.[12]\\r\\nOn 1 June 2007 the palace, Clarence House and other buildings within its curtilage (other than public pavement on Marlborough Road) were designated as a protected site for the purposes of Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The effect of the act was to make it a specific criminal offence for a person to trespass into the site.[13]","field3":"Where did royal family live before buckingham palace?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"from the 1900s","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Year-round schooling (YRS) has been present from the 1900s.[1] YRS first appeared in urban areas, because they were not tied to the agriculture cycle.[1] The first towns that implemented YRS were Chicago, Boston, Washington D.C., Cleveland, Buffalo, and Detroit.[1] These towns had schools sessions for 48 or more weeks at a time.[1] The types of school schedules that were used were the 12-1 (12 weeks in school with 1 week break between the 12 weeks, which was more popular) and 12-4 (4 weeks off in August and school ran continuous after).[1] The first summer school was introduced in 1865 at the First Church of Boston, MA.[1] In 1916 there would be 200 elementary schools offering summer school.[1] In 1971, a survey showed that 84% of the surveyed educational authorities predicted that all United States schools would be year-round within 15 years.[2] In 1973, states that provided year-round schooling options were: Washington, Nevada, California, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida, Vermont, and Kentucky.\\r\\nSome businesses dislike year-round calendars, because there is more competition for students trying to get jobs on their vacations since not all students have the same vacation time.[3] Businesses also find it easier to provide jobs on a year-round basis instead of having many in the summer for students.[2] Year-round schools also allow for students to graduate at different times, allowing for a decrease in unemployment when compared to all students graduating together and trying to get the few jobs that are open during that time.[1] Businesses also do not have the trouble of having a large volume of employees trying to take off the same vacation time for children getting out of school for winter, since the children would have different vacations.[1] Schools that adopt YRS are also better for industries that have a high volume of people in a short amount of time, because the different vacations allow for students to be open for employment more readily and vacationers to be more spread out instead of all at once.[1][2] Some tourist destinations that are very popular in colder months would benefit from this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral different studies have been conducted to learn more about the attitudes of students who attend year-round schools. The majority of these studies show that students' attitudes towards school did significantly improve as they spent more time on a year-round schedule.[4] Students who attend year-round school say that calendar is more balanced than their peers who have a typical school calendar.[5]\\r\\nStudents who attend year-round schools typically do as well as or slightly better in school than their peers who attend a traditionally scheduled school.[4]. Research also suggests year-round schools have positive effects on students who are at risk for academic problems, including those from underprivileged backgrounds and those who are poor performers in school.[6]\\r\\nAt-risk students are those who come from a low-income family, have a disability, are of an ethnic minority, or are influenced by something else that may cause them to perform poorly in school. In 1994, a study of three year-round schools showed a substantial gain in academic achievement for at-risk, low performing students. More frequent, short breaks provide struggling students more time for help.[7] These breaks can be used for remedial courses, tutoring, and enrichment, if needed.[5]\\r\\nThe North Carolina Department of Public Instruction researched the achievement differences between year-round and traditional-calendar using data from more than 345,000 North public schools. It was found that student achievement in year-round schools was statistically the same as it was in traditional schools. Another study compared the mathematics performance of 44 students in 5th and 6th grades on a year-round track with that of 40 students on a traditional track in the same school, which found no achievement gap.[6]\\r\\nA study conducted by the Ohio State University found that, over the course of a full year, students showed no significant improvement in reading and math scores in year-round schools compared to those students whose were in schools that followed the traditional academic calendar. Year-round schools do not add more school days to the 180 standard academic calendar. The total number of school days and vacation days remains unchanged, but instead is distributed throughout the year. Thus, students are not gaining more instructional days.[6]\\r\\nThe state of California's Department of Education claims that year-round schools' third-graders had an average increase of 9.5% on standardized tests and 13.3% in reading scores.[5]\\r\\nStudents would have the ability to graduate faster by being enrolled during their vacation times to allow for lessons.[3] Class sizes are reduced, creating better learning environments.[3] Another plus for students is that instead of failing an entire year of school, a student would only fail 45 days on a 45-15 plan, making it so that the student doesn't fall behind as much as a traditional school calendar.[2]\\r\\nStudies show that even though around 50% of parents are in favor of the year-round schedule before it is implemented, almost 80% are in favor of it after the first year.[4] Parents and families are able to still arrange daycare as well as vacations. The year-round schedule provides more opportunities for family vacations. This schedule can also save families money because they are able to take vacations during off-peak times.[5] Teachers would also be able to increase their income by teaching days of class on their vacations.[1][2][8] Some teachers also favor Year-Round School, because they can have flexible contracts, as in different vacation times.[3]\\r\\nStudents with attention learning disabilities may experience difficulties with longer school days. Younger elementary students who are not psychologically fully developed may not see any additional benefit to extended days. This in turn may increase behavioral issues within the classroom.[9] Students that attend year-round schooling may miss out on experiences such as summer camps. [10]\\r\\nAfter school activities may experience conflicts with longer school days. They may also experience budgeting issues with extended schooling sessions into the year.[9]\\r\\nAnother problem that students would face would be being distracted by other students or friends that are on their vacation, which would affect their grades.[8]\\r\\nStudents and teachers would have impersonal relationships due to different schedules for both groups.[1][3][8]\\r\\nMost of the main opposers to year-round schooling come from an agricultural background. This is because the kids would have to attend school in the summer, which is when most of the farm work is done. The families' livelihood depends on some children being able to help out on the farm. This is one of the main reasons most schools do not have year-round classes.[citation needed]\\r\\nIf schools are open for longer, the operating and maintenance costs may increase up to 10 percent.[11] These costs may add up and in turn interfere with budgets for other programs that are already struggling with funding such as the arts, sports and other extra-curricular activities that are state funded.\\r\\nWith today's current economic state, students often have to save up their own money to be able to attend college. This means they often will seek summer or part-time jobs to do so. Year-round schooling may create difficulties for teens to be able to maintain part-time or summer job to save up their money.[9]","field3":"When was the first year round school established?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"between 1937 and 1949","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.[1]\\r\\nThe title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron,[note 1] who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, not only the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise \\"Sam\\" Gamgee, Meriadoc \\"Merry\\" Brandybuck and Peregrin \\"Pippin\\" Took, but also the hobbits' chief allies and travelling companions: the Men, Aragorn son of Arathorn, a Ranger of the North, and Boromir, a Captain of Gondor; Gimli son of Gl܇in, a Dwarf warrior; Legolas Greenleaf, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a wizard.\\r\\nThe work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set, the other to be The Silmarillion, but this idea was dismissed by his publisher.[3][4] For economic reasons, The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955.[3][5] The three volumes were titled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Structurally, the novel is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material included at the end. Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume. The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into 38 languages.\\r\\nTolkien's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Although a major work in itself, the story was only the last movement of a larger epic Tolkien had worked on since 1917,[6] in a process he described as mythopoeia.[note 2] Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, include philology, mythology, religion and the author's distaste for the effects of industrialization, as well as earlier fantasy works and Tolkien's experiences in World War I.[8] The Lord of the Rings in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy; the impact of Tolkien's works is such that the use of the words \\"Tolkienian\\" and \\"Tolkienesque\\" have been recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary.[9]\\r\\nThe enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works,[10] and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. The Lord of the Rings has inspired, and continues to inspire, artwork, music, films and television, video games, board games, and subsequent literature. Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theatre, and film.[11] In 2003, it was named Britain's best-loved novel of all time in the BBC's The Big Read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of years before the events of the novel, the Dark Lord Sauron had forged the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power and corrupt those who wore them: the leaders of Men, Elves and Dwarves. Sauron was defeated by an alliance of Elves and Men led by Gil-galad and Elendil, respectively. In the final battle, Isildur, son of Elendil, cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger, causing Sauron to lose his physical form. Isildur claimed the Ring as an heirloom for his line, but when he was later ambushed and killed by the Orcs, the Ring was lost in the River Anduin.\\r\\nOver two thousand years later, the Ring was found by one of the river-folk called Dagol. His friend[12] Smagol fell under the Ring's influence and strangled Dagol to acquire it. Smagol was banished and hid under the Misty Mountains. The Ring gave him long life and changed him over hundreds of years into a twisted, corrupted creature called Gollum. Gollum lost the Ring, his \\"precious\\", and as told in The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins found it. Meanwhile, Sauron assumed a new form and took back his old realm of Mordor. When Gollum set out in search of the Ring, he was captured and tortured by Sauron. Sauron learned from Gollum that \\"Baggins\\" of the Shire had taken the Ring. Gollum was set loose. Sauron, who needed the Ring to regain his full power, sent forth his powerful servants, the Nazg?l, to seize it.\\r\\nThe story begins in the Shire, where the hobbit Frodo Baggins inherits the Ring from Bilbo Baggins, his cousin[note 3] and guardian. Neither hobbit is aware of the Ring's nature, but Gandalf the Grey, a wizard and an old friend of Bilbo, suspects it to be Sauron's Ring. Seventeen years later, after Gandalf confirms his guess, he tells Frodo the history of the Ring and counsels him to take it away from the Shire. Frodo sets out, accompanied by his gardener, servant and friend, Samwise (\\"Sam\\") Gamgee, and two cousins, Meriadoc \\"Merry\\" Brandybuck and Peregrin \\"Pippin\\" Took. They are nearly caught by the Black Riders, but shake off their pursuers by cutting through the Old Forest. There they are aided by Tom Bombadil, a strange and merry fellow who lives with his wife Goldberry in the forest.\\r\\nThe hobbits reach the town of Bree, where they encounter a Ranger named Strider, whom Gandalf had mentioned in a letter. Strider persuades the hobbits to take him on as their guide and protector. Together, they leave Bree after another close escape from the Black Riders. On the hill of Weathertop, they are again attacked by the Black Riders, who wound Frodo with a cursed blade. Strider fights them off and leads the hobbits towards the Elven refuge of Rivendell. Frodo falls deathly ill from the wound. The Black Riders nearly capture him at the Ford of Bruinen, but flood waters summoned by Elrond, master of Rivendell, rise up and overwhelm them.\\r\\nFrodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond's care. The Council of Elrond discusses the history of Sauron and the Ring. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, Isildur's heir. Gandalf reports that Sauron has corrupted Saruman, chief of the wizards. The Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed, but that can only be done by sending it to the Fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond, with the advice of Gandalf, chooses companions for him. The Company of the Ring are nine in number: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, and the Man Boromir, son of Denethor, the Ruling Steward of the land of Gondor.\\r\\nAfter a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains through the Redhorn Pass, the Company are forced to take a perilous path through the Mines of Moria. They are attacked by the Watcher in the Water before the doors of Moria. Inside Moria, they learn of the fate of Balin and his colony of Dwarves. After surviving an attack, they are pursued by Orcs and by an ancient demon called a Balrog. Gandalf faces the Balrog, and both of them fall into the abyss. The others escape and find refuge in the Elven forest of Lothl܇rien, where they are counselled by its rulers, Galadriel and Celeborn.\\r\\nWith boats and gifts from Galadriel, the Company travel down the River Anduin to the hill of Amon Hen. There, Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, but Frodo puts it on and disappears. Frodo chooses to go alone to Mordor, but Sam guesses what he intends and goes with him.\\r\\nOrcs sent by Saruman and Sauron kill Boromir and capture Merry and Pippin. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas debate which pair of hobbits to follow. They decide to pursue the Orcs taking Merry and Pippin to Saruman. In the kingdom of Rohan, the Orcs are slain by a company of Rohirrim. Merry and Pippin escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are befriended by Treebeard, the oldest of the tree-like Ents. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn. There they unexpectedly meet Gandalf. Gandalf explains that he slew the Balrog; darkness took him, but he was sent back to Middle-earth to complete his mission. He is clothed in white and is now Gandalf the White, for he has taken Saruman's place as the chief of the wizards. Gandalf assures his friends that Merry and Pippin are safe. Together they ride to Edoras, capital of Rohan. Gandalf frees Thoden, King of Rohan, from the influence of Saruman's spy Grma Wormtongue. Thoden musters his fighting strength and rides with his men to the ancient fortress of Helm's Deep, while Gandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Ents, roused by Merry and Pippin from their peaceful ways, attack Isengard, Saruman's stronghold, and trap the wizard in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to Thoden's aid. Gandalf brings an army of Rohirrim to Helm's Deep, and they defeat the Orcs, who flee into the \\"forest\\" of Huorns, never to be seen again. Gandalf offers Saruman a chance to turn away from evil. When Saruman refuses to listen, Gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his powers. After Saruman crawls back to his prison, Wormtongue drops a sphere to try and kill Gandalf. Pippin picks it up; it is revealed to be a palantr, a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron and through which Saruman was ensnared. Pippin is seen by Sauron. Gandalf rides for Minas Tirith, chief city of Gondor, taking Pippin with him.\\r\\nFrodo and Sam capture Gollum, who has followed them from Moria. They force him to guide them to Mordor. They find that the Black Gate of Mordor is too well guarded, so instead they travel to a secret way Gollum knows. On the way, they encounter Faramir, who, unlike his brother Boromir, resists the temptation to seize the Ring. Gollum ÿ who is torn between his loyalty to Frodo and his desire for the Ring ÿ betrays Frodo by leading him to the great spider Shelob in the tunnels of Cirith Ungol. Frodo falls to Shelob's sting. But with the help of Galadriel's gifts, Sam fights off the spider. Believing Frodo to be dead, Sam takes the Ring to continue the quest alone. Orcs find Frodo; Sam overhears them and learns that Frodo is still alive.\\r\\nSauron sends a great army against Gondor. Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack, while Thoden musters the Rohirrim to ride to Gondor's aid. Minas Tirith is besieged. Denethor is deceived by Sauron and falls into despair. He burns himself alive on a pyre, nearly taking his son Faramir with him. Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of the Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, who are bound by a curse which denies them rest until they fulfil their ancient forsworn oath to fight for the King of Gondor. Following Aragorn, the Army of the Dead strikes terror into the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor. Aragorn defeats the Corsairs and uses their ships to transport the men of southern Gondor up the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in time to turn the tide of battle. owyn, Thoden's niece, slays the Lord of the Nazg?l with help from Merry. Together, Gondor and Rohan defeat Sauron's army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, though at great cost. Thoden is slain, and owyn and Merry are injured.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Sam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. Aragorn leads an army of men from Gondor and Rohan to march on the Black Gate to distract Sauron from his true danger. His army is vastly outnumbered by the great might of Sauron. Frodo and Sam reach the edge of the Cracks of Doom, but Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer. He claims it for himself and puts it on his finger. Gollum suddenly reappears. He struggles with Frodo and bites off Frodo's finger with the Ring still on it. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power forever. All he created collapses, the Nazg?l perish, and his armies are thrown into such disarray that Aragorn's forces emerge victorious.\\r\\nAragorn is crowned Elessar, King of Arnor and Gondor, and weds Arwen, daughter of Elrond. The four hobbits make their way back to the Shire, only to find out that it has been taken over by men led by Sharkey. The hobbits raise a rebellion and liberate the Shire, though 19 hobbits are killed and 30 wounded. Sharkey turns out to be Saruman. Frodo stops the hobbits from killing the wizard after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, but Grma turns on Saruman and kills him in front of Bag End, Frodo's home. He is slain in turn by hobbit archers, and the War of the Ring comes to its true end on Frodo's very doorstep.\\r\\nMerry and Pippin are celebrated as heroes. Sam marries Rosie Cotton and uses his gifts from Galadriel to help heal the Shire. But Frodo is still wounded in body and spirit, having borne the Ring for so long. A few years later, in the company of Bilbo and Gandalf, Frodo sails from the Grey Havens west over the Sea to the Undying Lands to find peace.\\r\\nIn the appendices, Sam gives his daughter Elanor the Red Book of Westmarch, which contains the story of Bilbo's adventures and the War of the Ring as witnessed by the hobbits. Sam is then said to have crossed west over the Sea himself, the last of the Ring-bearers.\\r\\nSome characters in The Lord of the Rings are unequivocal protagonists, and others are absolute antagonists. However despite criticism that the book's characters \\"are all either black or white\\", some of the 'good' characters have darker sides that feature in the story, and likewise some of the villains have \\"good impulses\\".[13] Therefore the categorization of characters as either 'protagonists' or 'antagonists' below indicates their general role in the story.\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings started as a sequel to J. R. R. Tolkien's work The Hobbit, published in 1937.[15] The popularity of The Hobbit had led George Allen & Unwin, the publishers, to request a sequel. Tolkien warned them that he wrote quite slowly, and responded with several stories he had already developed. Having rejected his contemporary drafts for The Silmarillion, putting on hold Roverandom, and accepting Farmer Giles of Ham, Allen & Unwin thought more stories about hobbits would be popular.[16] So at the age of 45, Tolkien began writing the story that would become The Lord of the Rings. The story would not be finished until 12 years later, in 1949, and would not be fully published until 1955, when Tolkien was 63 years old.\\r\\nPersuaded by his publishers, he started \\"a new Hobbit\\" in December 1937.[15] After several false starts, the story of the One Ring emerged. The idea for the first chapter (\\"A Long-Expected Party\\") arrived fully formed, although the reasons behind Bilbo's disappearance, the significance of the Ring, and the title The Lord of the Rings did not arrive until the spring of 1938.[15] Originally, he planned to write a story in which Bilbo had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more; however, he remembered the Ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work.[15] As the story progressed, he also brought in elements from The Silmarillion mythology.[17]\\r\\nWriting was slow, because Tolkien had a full-time academic position, and needed to earn further money as a university examiner.[18] Tolkien abandoned The Lord of the Rings during most of 1943 and only restarted it in April 1944,[15] as a serial for his son Christopher Tolkien, who was sent chapters as they were written while he was serving in South Africa with the Royal Air Force. Tolkien made another concerted effort in 1946, and showed the manuscript to his publishers in 1947.[15] The story was effectively finished the next year, but Tolkien did not complete the revision of earlier parts of the work until 1949.[15] The original manuscripts, which total 9,250 pages, now reside in the J. R. R. Tolkien Collection at Marquette University.[19]\\r\\nThe influence of the Welsh language, which Tolkien had learned, is summarized in his essay English and Welsh: \\"If I may once more refer to my work. The Lord of the Rings, in evidence: the names of persons and places in this story were mainly composed on patterns deliberately modelled on those of Welsh (closely similar but not identical). This element in the tale has given perhaps more pleasure to more readers than anything else in it.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings developed as a personal exploration by Tolkien of his interests in philology, religion (particularly Roman Catholicism[22]), fairy tales, Norse and general Germanic mythology,[23][24] and also Celtic,[25][better?source?needed] Slavic,[26][27][28] Persian,[29] Greek,[30] and Finnish mythology.[31] Tolkien acknowledged, and external critics have verified, the influences of George MacDonald and William Morris[32] and the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf.[33] The question of a direct influence of Wagner's The Nibelung's Ring on Tolkien's work is debated by critics.\\r\\nTolkien included neither any explicit religion nor cult in his work. Rather the themes, moral philosophy, and cosmology of The Lord of the Rings reflect his Catholic worldview. In one of his letters Tolkien states, \\"The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision. That is why I have not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like 'religion', to cults or practices, in the imaginary world. For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism.\\"[22]\\r\\nSome locations and characters were inspired by Tolkien's childhood in Birmingham, where he first lived near Sarehole Mill, and later near Edgbaston Reservoir.[34] There are also hints of the Black Country, which is within easy reach of north west Edgbaston. This shows in such names as \\"Underhill\\", and the description of Saruman's industrialization of Isengard and The Shire. It has also been suggested that The Shire and its surroundings were based on the countryside around Stonyhurst College in Lancashire where Tolkien frequently stayed during the 1940s.[35] The work was influenced by the effects of his military service during World War I, to the point that Frodo has been \\"diagnosed\\" as suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, or \\"shell-shock\\", which was first diagnosed under that name at the Battle of the Somme, at which Tolkien served.[36]\\r\\nA dispute with his publisher, George Allen & Unwin, led to the book being offered to Collins in 1950. Tolkien intended The Silmarillion (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with The Lord of the Rings, but A&U were unwilling to do this. After Milton Waldman, his contact at Collins, expressed the belief that The Lord of the Rings itself \\"urgently wanted cutting\\", Tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952.[37] Collins did not; and so Tolkien wrote to Allen and Unwin, saying, \\"I would gladly consider the publication of any part of the stuff\\", fearing his work would never see the light of day.[15]\\r\\nFor publication, the book was divided into three volumes to minimize any potential financial loss due to the high cost of type-setting and modest anticipated sales: The Fellowship of the Ring (Books I and II), The Two Towers (Books III and IV), and The Return of the King (Books V and VI plus six appendices).[38] Delays in producing appendices, maps and especially an index led to the volumes being published later than originally hoped?ÿ on 29 July 1954, on 11 November 1954 and on 20 October 1955 respectively in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Houghton Mifflin published The Fellowship of the Ring on 21 October 1954, The Two Towers on 21 April 1955, and The Return of the King on 5 January 1956.[39] The Return of the King was especially delayed due to Tolkien revising the ending and preparing appendices (some of which had to be left out because of space constraints). Tolkien did not like the title The Return of the King, believing it gave away too much of the storyline, but deferred to his publisher's preference. He suggested the title The Two Towers in a deliberately ambiguous attempt to link the unconnected books III and IV, and as such the eponymous towers could be either Orthanc and Barad-d?r, or Minas Tirith and Barad-d?r, or Orthanc and Cirith Ungol.\\r\\nTolkien was initially opposed to titles being given to each two-book volume, preferring instead the use of book titles: e.g. The Lord of the Rings: Vol. 1, The Ring Sets Out and The Ring Goes South; Vol. 2, The Treason of Isengard and The Ring Goes East; Vol. 3, The War of the Ring and The End of the Third Age. However these individual book titles were later scrapped, and after pressure from his publishers, Tolkien initially suggested the titles: Vol. 1, The Shadow Grows; Vol. 2, The Ring in the Shadow; Vol. 3, The War of the Ring or The Return of the King.[40][41]\\r\\nThe books were published under a profit-sharing arrangement, whereby Tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties until the books had broken even, after which he would take a large share of the profits.[42] It has ultimately become one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.[1]\\r\\nThe book was published in the UK by Allen & Unwin until 1990 when the publisher and its assets were acquired by HarperCollins.[43][44]\\r\\nIn the early 1960s Donald A. Wollheim, science fiction editor of the paperback publisher Ace Books, claimed that The Lord of the Rings was not protected in the United States under American copyright law because Houghton Mifflin, the US hardcover publisher, had neglected to copyright the work in the United States.[45][46] Then, in 1965, Ace Books proceeded to publish an edition, unauthorized by Tolkien and without paying royalties to him. Tolkien took issue with this and quickly notified his fans of this objection.[47] Grass-roots pressure from these fans became so great that Ace Books withdrew their edition and made a nominal payment to Tolkien.[48][49] Authorized editions followed from Ballantine Books and Houghton Mifflin to tremendous commercial success. Tolkien undertook various textual revisions to produce a version of the book that would be published with his consent and establish an unquestioned US copyright. This text became the Second Edition of The Lord of the Rings, published in 1965.[48] The first Ballantine paperback edition was printed in October that year, and sold a quarter of a million copies within ten months. On September 4, 1966, the novel debuted on New York Times' Paperback Bestsellers list as number three, and was number one by December 4, a position it held for eight weeks.[50] Houghton Mifflin editions after 1994 consolidate variant revisions by Tolkien, and corrections supervised by Christopher Tolkien, which resulted, after some initial glitches, in a computer-based unified text.[51]\\r\\nIn 2004, for the 50th Anniversary Edition, Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, under supervision from Christopher Tolkien, studied and revised the text to eliminate as many errors and inconsistencies as possible, some of which had been introduced by well-meaning compositors of the first printing in 1954, and never been corrected.[52] The 2005 edition of the book contained further corrections noticed by the editors and submitted by readers. Further corrections were added to the 60th Anniversary Edition in 2014.[53]\\r\\nSeveral editions, notably the 50th Anniversary Edition, combine all three books into one volume, with the result that pagination varies widely over the various editions.\\r\\nFrom 1988 to 1992 Christopher Tolkien published the surviving drafts of The Lord of The Rings, chronicling and illuminating with commentary the stages of the text's development, in volumes 6ÿ9 of his History of Middle-earth series. The four volumes carry the titles The Return of the Shadow, The Treason of Isengard, The War of the Ring, and Sauron Defeated.\\r\\nThe novel has been translated, with various degrees of success, into at least 56 languages.[54] Tolkien, an expert in philology, examined many of these translations, and made comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work. As he was unhappy with some choices made by early translators, such as the Swedish translation by ?ke Ohlmarks,[55] Tolkien wrote a \\"Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings\\" (1967). Because The Lord of the Rings purports to be a translation of the fictitious Red Book of Westmarch, with the English language representing the Westron of the \\"original\\", Tolkien suggested that translators attempt to capture the interplay between English and the invented nomenclature of the English work, and gave several examples along with general guidance.\\r\\nWhile early reviews for The Lord of the Rings were mixed, reviews in various media have been, on the whole, highly positive and acknowledge Tolkien's literary achievement as a significant one. The initial review in the Sunday Telegraph described it as \\"among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century\\".[56] The Sunday Times echoed this sentiment, stating that \\"the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and those who are going to read them\\".[56] The New York Herald Tribune also seemed to have an idea of how popular the books would become, writing in its review that they were \\"destined to outlast our time\\".[57] W. H. Auden, an admirer of Tolkien's writings, regarded The Lord of the Rings as a \\"masterpiece\\", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton's Paradise Lost.[58]\\r\\nNew York Times reviewer Judith Shulevitz criticized the \\"pedantry\\" of Tolkien's literary style, saying that he \\"formulated a high-minded belief in the importance of his mission as a literary preservationist, which turns out to be death to literature itself\\".[59] Critic Richard Jenkyns, writing in The New Republic, criticized the work for a lack of psychological depth. Both the characters and the work itself are, according to Jenkyns, \\"anemic, and lacking in fibre\\".[60] Even within Tolkien's literary group, The Inklings, reviews were mixed. Hugo Dyson complained loudly at its readings.[61][62] However, another Inkling, C. S. Lewis, had very different feelings, writing, \\"here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron. Here is a book which will break your heart.\\" Despite these reviews and its lack of paperback printing until the 1960s, The Lord of the Rings initially sold well in hardback.[6]\\r\\nIn 1957, The Lord of the Rings was awarded the International Fantasy Award. Despite its numerous detractors, the publication of the Ace Books and Ballantine paperbacks helped The Lord of the Rings become immensely popular in the United States in the 1960s. The book has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.[63] In the 2003 \\"Big Read\\" survey conducted in Britain by the BBC, The Lord of the Rings was found to be the \\"Nation's best-loved book\\". In similar 2004 polls both Germany[64] and Australia[65] also found The Lord of the Rings to be their favourite book. In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, The Lord of the Rings was judged to be their favourite \\"book of the millennium\\".[66] The Lord of the Rings was awarded the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award in 2009.\\r\\nAlthough The Lord of the Rings was published in the 1950s, Tolkien insisted that the One Ring was not an allegory for the atomic bomb,[67] nor were his works a strict allegory of any kind, but were open to interpretation as the reader saw fit.[68][69]\\r\\nA few critics have found what they consider to be racial elements in the story, generally based upon their views of how Tolkien's imagery depicts good and evil, characters' race (e.g. Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit, Southron, N~men܇rean, Orc); and that the character's race is seen as determining their behaviour.[70][71][72] Counter-arguments note that race-focused critiques often omit relevant textual evidence to the contrary,[73][74][75] cite imagery from adaptations rather than the work itself;[76] ignore the absence of evidence of racist attitudes or events in the author's personal life,[73][76][77] and claim that the perception of racism is itself a marginal view.[77]\\r\\nThe opinions that pit races against one another are likely to reflect Tolkien's critique on war rather than a racist perspective. In The Two Towers, the character Samwise sees a fallen foe and considers for a moment the humanity of this fallen Southron who, just moments before, is shown to be a man of color.[78] Director Peter Jackson considers Sam this scene in the director's commentary of the scene and argues that Tolkien isn't projecting any negative sentiments towards the individual soldier because of his race, but the evil that's driving them from their authority,[79] These sentiments, Jackson argues, were derived from Tolkien's experience in the Great War and found their way into his writings to show the evils of war itself, not of other races.\\r\\nCritics have also seen social class rather than race as being the determining factor in the portrayal of good and evil.[73] Commentators such as science fiction author David Brin have interpreted the work to hold unquestioning devotion to a traditional elitist social structure.[80] In his essay \\"Epic Pooh\\", science fiction and fantasy author Michael Moorcock critiques the world-view displayed by the book as deeply conservative, in both the \\"paternalism\\" of the narrative voice and the power-structures in the narrative.[81] Tom Shippey cites the origin of this portrayal of evil as a reflection of the prejudices of European middle-classes during the inter-war years towards the industrial working class.[82]\\r\\nOther observers have cited Christian, specifically Catholic, themes in The Lord of the Rings.[83]\\r\\nThe book has been read as fitting the model of Joseph Campbell's \\"monomyth\\".[84]\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings has been adapted for film, radio and stage.\\r\\nThe book has been adapted for radio four times. In 1955 and 1956, the BBC broadcast The Lord of the Rings, a 13-part radio adaptation of the story. In the 1960s radio station WBAI produced a short radio adaptation. A 1979 dramatization of The Lord of the Rings was broadcast in the United States and subsequently issued on tape and CD. In 1981, the BBC broadcast The Lord of the Rings, a new dramatization in 26 half-hour instalments. This dramatization of The Lord of the Rings has subsequently been made available on both tape and CD both by the BBC and other publishers. For this purpose it is generally edited into 13 one-hour episodes.\\r\\nFollowing J. R. R. Tolkien's sale of the film rights for The Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1969, rock band The Beatles considered a corresponding film project and approached Stanley Kubrick as a potential director; however, Kubrick turned down the offer, explaining to John Lennon that he thought the novel could not be adapted into a film due to its immensity.[85][86] The eventual director of the film adaptation Peter Jackson further explained that a major hindrance to the project's progression was Tolkien's opposition to the involvement of the Beatles.[87]\\r\\nTwo film adaptations of the book have been made. The first was J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1978), by animator Ralph Bakshi, the first part of what was originally intended to be a two-part adaptation of the story; it covers The Fellowship of the Ring and part of The Two Towers. A three-issue comic book version of the movie was also published in Europe (but not printed in English), with illustrations by Luis Bermejo. When Bakshi's investors shied away of financing the second film that would complete the story, the remainder of the story was covered in an animated television special by Rankin-Bass. Stylistically, the two segments are very different. The second and more commercially successful adaptation was Peter Jackson's live action The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, produced by New Line Cinema and released in three instalments as The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). All three parts won multiple Academy Awards, including consecutive Best Picture nominations. The final instalment of this trilogy was the second film to break the one-billion-dollar barrier and won a total of 11 Oscars (something only two other films in history, Ben-Hur and Titanic, have accomplished), including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.\\r\\nThe Hunt for Gollum, a fan film based on elements of the appendices to The Lord of the Rings, was released on the internet in May 2009 and has been covered in major media.[88] Born of Hope, written by Paula DiSante, directed by Kate Madison, and released in December 2009, is a fan film based upon the appendices of The Lord of the Rings.[89]\\r\\nOn 13 November 2017, it was announced that Amazon had acquired the global television rights to The Lord of the Rings, committing to a multi-season television series. The series will not be a direct adaptation of the books, but will instead introduce new stories that are set before The Fellowship of the Ring.[90] Amazon said the deal included potential for spin-off series as well.[91] The press release referred to \\"previously unexplored stories based on J.R.R. Tolkien's original writings\\". Amazon will be the producer in conjunction with the Tolkien Estate and the Tolkien Trust, HarperCollins and New Line Cinema.[92] According to a 2018 report, it will be the most expensive TV show ever produced.[93]\\r\\nIn 1990, Recorded Books published an audio version of The Lord of the Rings,[94] with British actor Rob Inglis?ÿ who had previously starred in his own one-man stage productions of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings?ÿ reading. A large-scale musical theatre adaptation, The Lord of the Rings was first staged in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2006 and opened in London in May 2007.\\r\\nThe enormous popularity of Tolkien's work expanded the demand for fantasy fiction. Largely thanks to The Lord of the Rings, the genre flowered throughout the 1960s, and enjoys popularity to the present day. The opus has spawned many imitators, such as The Sword of Shannara, which Lin Carter called \\"the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read\\".[95] Dungeons & Dragons, which popularized the role-playing game (RPG) genre in the 1970s, features many races found in The Lord of the Rings, most notably halflings (another term for hobbits), elves (who are distinct from dark elves, following Tolkien's example), dwarves, half-elves, orcs, and dragons. However, Gary Gygax, lead designer of the game, maintained that he was influenced very little by The Lord of the Rings, stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game.[96]\\r\\nBecause D&D has gone on to influence many popular role-playing video games, the influence of The Lord of the Rings extends to many of them as well, with titles such as Dragon Quest,[97][98] the Ultima series, EverQuest, the Warcraft series, and the Elder Scrolls series of games[99] as well as video games set in Middle-earth itself.\\r\\nResearch also suggests that some consumers of fantasy games derive their motivation from trying to create an epic fantasy narrative which is influenced by The Lord of the Rings.[100]\\r\\nIn 1965, songwriter Donald Swann, who was best known for his collaboration with Michael Flanders as Flanders & Swann, set six poems from The Lord of the Rings and one from The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (\\"Errantry\\") to music. When Swann met with Tolkien to play the songs for his approval, Tolkien suggested for \\"Namri?\\" (Galadriel's lament) a setting reminiscent of plain chant, which Swann accepted.[101] The songs were published in 1967 as The Road Goes Ever On: A Song Cycle,[102] and a recording of the songs performed by singer William Elvin with Swann on piano was issued that same year by Caedmon Records as Poems and Songs of Middle Earth.[103]\\r\\nRock bands of the 1970s were musically and lyrically inspired by the fantasy embracing counter-culture of the time; British 70s rock band Led Zeppelin recorded several songs that contain explicit references to The Lord of the Rings, such as mentioning Gollum in \\"Ramble On\\", the Misty Mountains in \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", and Ringwraiths in \\"The Battle of Evermore\\". In 1970, the Swedish musician Bo Hansson released an instrumental concept album based on the book titled Sagan om ringen (translated as \\"The Saga of the Ring\\", which was the title of the Swedish translation of The Lord of the Rings at the time).[104] The album was subsequently released internationally as Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings in 1972.[104] The songs \\"Rivendell\\" and \\"The Necromancer\\" by the progressive rock band Rush were inspired by Tolkien. Styx also paid homage to Tolkien on their album Pieces of Eight with the song \\"Lords of the Ring\\", while Black Sabbath's song, \\"The Wizard\\", which appeared on their debut album, was influenced by Tolkien's hero, Gandalf. The heavy metal bands Cirith Ungol and Amon Amarth took their names from landmarks in Mordor. Progressive rock group Camel paid homage to the text in their lengthy composition \\"Nimrodel/The Procession/The White Rider\\", and progressive rock band Barclay James Harvest was inspired by the character Galadriel to write a song by that name, and used \\"Bombadil\\", the name of another character, as a pseudonym under which their 1972 single \\"Breathless\\"/\\"When the City Sleeps\\" was released; there are other references scattered through the BJH oeuvre.\\r\\nLater, from the 1980s to the present day, many heavy metal acts have been influenced by Tolkien. Blind Guardian has written many songs relating to Middle-earth, including the full concept album Nightfall in Middle Earth. Almost the entire discography of Battlelore are Tolkien-themed. Summoning's music is based upon Tolkien and holds the distinction of the being the only artist to have crafted a song entirely in the Black Speech of Mordor. Gorgoroth and Amon Amarth take their names from an area of Mordor, and Burzum take their name from the Black Speech of Mordor. The Finnish metal band Nightwish and the Norwegian metal band Tristania have also incorporated many Tolkien references into their music. American heavy metal band Megadeth released two songs titled \\"This Day We Fight!\\" and \\"How the Story Ends\\", which were both inspired by The Lord of the Rings.[105] German folk metal band Eichenschild is named for Thorin Oakenshield, a character in The Hobbit, and naturally has a number of Tolkien-themed songs. They are not to be confused with the '70s folk rock band Thorin Eichenschild.\\r\\nIn 1988, Dutch composer and trombonist Johan de Meij completed his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", which encompassed 5 movements, titled \\"Gandalf\\", \\"Lothl܇rien\\", \\"Gollum\\", \\"Journey in the Dark\\", and \\"Hobbits\\". In 1989 the symphony was awarded the Sudler Composition Award, awarded biennially for best wind band composition. The Danish Tolkien Ensemble have released a number of albums that feature the complete poems and songs of The Lord of the Rings set to music, with some featuring recitation by Christopher Lee.\\r\\nEnya wrote an instrumental piece called \\"Lothl܇rien\\" in 1991, and composed two songs for the film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\"May It Be\\" (sung in English and Quenya) and \\"Anron\\" (sung in Sindarin).\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings has had a profound and wide-ranging impact on popular culture, beginning with its publication in the 1950s, but especially throughout the 1960s and 1970s, during which time young people embraced it as a countercultural saga.[106] \\"Frodo Lives!\\" and \\"Gandalf for President\\" were two phrases popular amongst United States Tolkien fans during this time.[107]\\r\\nParodies like the Harvard Lampoon's Bored of the Rings, the VeggieTales episode \\"Lord of the Beans\\", the South Park episode \\"The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers\\", the Futurama film Bender's Game, The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius episode \\"Lights! Camera! Danger!\\", The Big Bang Theory episode \\"The Precious Fragmentation\\", and the American Dad! episode \\"The Return of the Bling\\" are testimony to the work's continual presence in popular culture.\\r\\nIn 1969, Tolkien sold the merchandising rights to The Lord of The Rings (and The Hobbit) to United Artists under an agreement stipulating a lump sum payment of S10,000[108] plus a 7.5% royalty after costs,[109] payable to Allen & Unwin and the author.[110] In 1976, three years after the author's death, United Artists sold the rights to Saul Zaentz Company, who now trade as Tolkien Enterprises. Since then all \\"authorized\\" merchandise has been signed-off by Tolkien Enterprises, although the intellectual property rights of the specific likenesses of characters and other imagery from various adaptations is generally held by the adaptors.[111] Outside any commercial exploitation from adaptations, from the late 1960s onwards there has been an increasing variety of original licensed merchandise, from posters and calendars created by illustrators such as Pauline Baynes and the Brothers Hildebrandt, to figurines and miniatures to computer, video, tabletop and role-playing games. Recent examples include the Spiel des Jahres award winning (for best use of literature in a game) board game The Lord of the Rings by Reiner Knizia and the Golden Joystick award-winning massively multiplayer online role-playing game, The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar by Turbine, Inc..\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings has been mentioned in numerous songs including The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins by Leonard Nimoy, Led Zeppelin's Misty Mountain Hop, Over the Hills and Far Away, Ramble On, and The Battle of Evermore, Genesis' song \\"Stagnation\\" (from Trespass, 1970) was about Gollum, and Argent included the song \\"Lothlorien\\" on the 1971 album Ring of Hands.\\r\\nSteve Peregrin Took (born Stephen Ross Porter) of British rock band T. Rex took his name from the hobbit Peregrin Took (better known as Pippin). Took later recorded under the pseudonym 'Shagrat the Vagrant', before forming a band called Shagrat in 1970.","field3":"When were lord of the rings books written?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"41 stories","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"30 St Mary Axe (informally known as the Gherkin and previously as the Swiss Re Building) is a commercial skyscraper in London's primary financial district, the City of London. It was completed in December 2003 and opened in April 2004.[9] With 41 stories it is 180 metres (591?ft) tall[3] and stands on the former sites of the Baltic Exchange and Chamber of Shipping, which were extensively damaged in 1992 by the explosion of a bomb placed by the Provisional IRA in St Mary Axe, the street from which the tower takes its name.[4][10]\\r\\nAfter plans to build the 92-storey Millennium Tower were dropped, 30 St Mary Axe was designed by Norman Foster and Arup Group[11] and it was erected by Skanska, with construction commencing in 2001.[3]\\r\\nThe building has become a recognisable feature of London and is one of the city's most widely recognised examples of contemporary architecture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building stands on the former sites of the Baltic Exchange (24-28 St Mary Axe), which was the headquarters of a global marketplace for ship sales and shipping information, and the Chamber of Shipping (30-32 St Mary Axe). On 10 April 1992, the Provisional IRA detonated a bomb close to the Exchange, causing extensive damage to the historic building and neighbouring structures.[4][10]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom government's statutory adviser on the historic environment, English Heritage, and the City of London's governing body, the City of London Corporation, were keen that any redevelopment must restore the Baltic Exchange's old fa?ade onto St Mary Axe. The Exchange Hall was a celebrated fixture of the ship trading market.[12][13]\\r\\nAfter English Heritage later discovered the damage was far more severe than initially thought, they stopped insisting on full restoration, albeit over the objections of the architectural conservationists who favoured reconstruction.[14] The Baltic Exchange and the Chamber of Shipping sold the land to Trafalgar House in 1995.[15] Most of the remaining structures on Baltic Exchange site were then carefully dismantled, the interior of Exchange Hall and the fa?ade were preserved, hoping for a reconstruction of the building in the future.[15] The salvaged material was eventually sold for S800,000 and moved to Tallinn, Estonia, where it awaits reconstruction as the centrepiece of the city's commercial sector.\\r\\nIn 1996, Trafalgar House submitted plans for the Millennium Tower, a 386-metre (1,266?ft) building with more than 140,000?m2 (1,500,000?sq?ft) of office space, apartments, shops, restaurants and gardens. This plan was dropped after objections for being totally out-of-scale with the City of London and anticipated disruption to flight paths for both London City and London Heathrow airports; the revised plan for a lower tower was accepted.\\r\\nThe tower's topmost panoramic dome, known as the \\"lens\\", recalls the iconic glass dome that covered part of the ground floor of the Baltic Exchange and much of which is now displayed at the National Maritime Museum.[4][16]\\r\\nThe Gherkin nickname was applied to the current building at least as long ago as 1999, referring to that plan's highly unorthodox layout and appearance.[17]\\r\\nOn 23 August 2000, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott granted planning permission to construct a building much larger than the old Exchange on the site.[12] The site was special because it needed development, was not on any of the \\"sight lines\\" (planning guidance requires that new buildings do not obstruct or detract from the view of St Paul's dome when viewed from a number of locations around London), and it had housed the Baltic Exchange.\\r\\nThe plan for the site was to reconstruct the Baltic Exchange. GMW Architects proposed a new rectangular building surrounding a restored exchange: the square shape would have the type of large floor plan that banks liked. Eventually, the planners realised that the exchange was not recoverable, forcing them to relax their building constraints; they hinted that an \\"architecturally significant\\" building might obtain a favourable reception from city authorities. This gave the architect a free hand in the design; it eliminated the restrictive demands for a large, capital-efficient, money-making building, whose design was per the client's desire.[18]\\r\\nSwiss Re's low level plan met the planning authority's desire to maintain London's traditional streetscape with its relatively narrow streets. The mass of the Swiss Re tower was not too imposing. Like Barclays Bank's former City headquarters in Lombard Street, the idea was that the passer-by in neighbouring streets would be nearly oblivious to the tower's existence until directly underneath it.\\r\\nThe building was constructed by Skanska, completed in December 2003 and opened on 28 April 2004.[4] The primary occupant of the building is Swiss Re, a global reinsurance company, which had the building commissioned as the head office for its UK operation. The tower is thus sometimes known as the Swiss Re Building, although this name has never been official and has more recently fallen out of favour, since the company's main headquarters is in Zurich and the Gherkin name has become more popular.[19]\\r\\nThe building uses energy-saving methods, which allow it to use half the power that a similar tower would typically consume.[19] Gaps in each floor create six shafts that serve as a natural ventilation system for the entire building, even though required firebreaks on every sixth floor interrupt the \\"chimney\\". The shafts create a giant double glazing effect; air is sandwiched between two layers of glazing and insulates the office space inside.[4]\\r\\nArchitects promote double glazing in residential houses, which avoids the inefficient convection of heat across the relatively narrow gap between the panes, but the tower exploits this effect. The shafts pull warm air out of the building during the summer and warm the building in the winter using passive solar heating. The shafts also allow sunlight to pass through the building, making the work environment more pleasing, and keeping the lighting costs down.\\r\\nThe primary methods for controlling wind-excited sways are to increase the stiffness, or increase damping with tuned/active mass dampers. To a design by Arup, its fully triangulated perimeter structure makes the building sufficiently stiff without any extra reinforcements. Despite its overall curved glass shape, there is only one piece of curved glass on the building, the lens-shaped cap at the apex.[4]\\r\\nOn the building's top level (the 40th floor), there is a bar for tenants and their guests, featuring a panoramic view of London. A restaurant operates on the 39th floor, and private dining rooms on the 38th.[19] Whereas most buildings have extensive lift equipment on the roof of the building, this was not possible for the Gherkin, since a bar had been planned for the 40th floor. The architects dealt with this by having the main lift only reach the 34th floor, and then having a push-from-below lift to the 39th floor. There is a marble stairwell and a disabled persons' lift, which leads the visitor up to the bar in the dome.\\r\\nThe building is visible over long distances: From the north, for instance, it can be seen from the M11 motorway, some 32 kilometres (20?mi) away,[19][20] while to the west it can be seen from the statue of George III in Windsor Great Park.\\r\\nIn April 2005, the press reported that a glass panel, two thirds up the tower, had fallen to the plaza beneath. The plaza was sealed off, but the building remained open. A temporary covered walkway, extending across the plaza to the building's reception, was erected to protect visitors. Engineers examined the other 744 glass panels on the building.[21] The cost of repair was covered by main contractor Skanska and curtain-wall supplier Schmidlin (now called Schmidlin-TSK AG).[19]\\r\\nSince its completion, the building has won a number of awards for architecture. In October 2004, the architect was awarded the 2004 RIBA Stirling Prize. For the first time in the prize's history, the judges were unanimous.[22] In December 2005, a survey of the world's largest firms of architects published in 2006 BD World Architecture 200 voted the tower as the most admired new building in the world. However, Ken Shuttleworth, who worked for Foster and Partners on the design of the building, said in 2011 that he believed the style was now out-moded: \\"I was looking at the glass all around and [thought], 'Why on earth did we do that?' Now we would do things differently\\".[23] The building featured in recent films such as Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, Russell Crowe's A Good Year, Sharon Stone's Basic Instinct 2, and Woody Allen's Match Point[24] and, rechristened the Spirit of London, became the spaceship centrepiece of Keith Mansfield's 2008 novel Johnny Mackintosh and the Spirit of London.[25]\\r\\nIn September 2006, the building was put up for sale with a price tag of S600 million.[26] Potential buyers included British Land, Land Securities, Prudential, ING, and the Abu Dhabi royal family. On 21 February 2007, IVG Immobilien AG and UK investment firm Evans Randall completed their joint purchase of the building for S630 million, making it Britain's most expensive office building.[27][28] Swiss Re booked a gain of more than S300 million from the sale.[29] The new owners are seeking compensation from four of their former managers on the deal, in which about S620 million was paid for a building with a build cost of about S200 million, giving the previous owners a clear S300 million profit.[30]\\r\\nSince February 2010,[31] Sky News has broadcast its flagship business programme, Jeff Randall Live, from a studio in the building. In addition the top two floors of tower are now available on a private hire basis for events.[32]\\r\\nDeloitte announced in April 2014 that the building was again being put up for sale, with an expected price of S550 million.[33] The current owners could not afford to make loan repayments, citing differences in the value of the multi-currency loan and the British pound, high interest rates and general financing structure.[34] In November 2014, the Gherkin was purchased for S700 million by the Safra Group, controlled by the Brazilian billionaire Joseph Safra.[35]\\r\\nAs of January 2015, current occupiers of the building include the following:\\r\\nAdditionally, retailers and restaurants operate from the site, such as The Sterling and Bridge's Newsagent.","field3":"How many floors are there in the gherkin?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Chatsworth High School","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Val Edward Kilmer (born December 31, 1959)[2] is an American actor. Originally a stage actor, Kilmer became popular in the mid-1980s after a string of appearances in comedy films, starting with Top Secret! (1984), then the cult classic Real Genius (1985), as well as the military action film Top Gun (1986) and the fantasy film Willow (1988).\\r\\nSome of his other notable film roles include Jim Morrison in The Doors (1991), Doc Holliday in Tombstone (1993), armed robber Chris Shiherlis in Heat (1995), Bruce Wayne / Batman in Batman Forever (1995), Simon Templar in The Saint (1997), astronaut Robby Gallagher in Red Planet (2000), and a meth-using informant in The Salton Sea (2002).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKilmer was born December 31, 1959, in Los Angeles,[2] the son of Gladys Swanette (ne?Ekstadt) and Eugene Dorris Kilmer, an aerospace equipment distributor and real estate developer.[3] His mother was of Swedish descent.[4] His father's ancestry included English, Scots-Irish, French and German.[5][6] His parents divorced in 1968 when he was 8 years old. Kilmer's grandfather was a gold miner in New Mexico, near the border with Arizona.[7] In 1977 Kilmer's younger brother Wesley drowned in a swimming pool at age 15; their father died in 1993.[8]\\r\\nKilmer attended Berkeley Hall School, a Christian Science school in Los Angeles, until ninth grade.[9] He attended Chatsworth High School with Kevin Spacey and Mare Winningham, and also attended the Hollywood Professional School.[2] He became the youngest person at the time to be accepted into the Juilliard School's Drama Division, where he was a member of Group 10.[10]\\r\\nOn May 5, 2012, Kilmer was awarded an honorary doctorate of Fine Arts from William Woods University.[11]\\r\\nIn 1981, while at Juilliard, Kilmer co-authored and starred in the play How It All Began,[12] which was performed at the Public Theater at the New York Shakespeare Festival. Kilmer turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 film The Outsiders, as he had prior theatre commitments.[13] In 1983 he appeared off Broadway in The Slab Boys with Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn. That same year, his first off-stage acting role (excluding television commercials) came in the form of an episode of ABC Afterschool Special called One Too Many, which was an educational drama on drinking and driving;[14] it also starred a young Michelle Pfeiffer. Also in 1983, Kilmer self-published a collection of his own poetry entitled My Edens After Burns, that included poems inspired by his time with Pfeiffer. The book of poems is difficult to obtain, and expensive; even second-hand copies fetch $300 and up.[15][16][17]\\r\\nHis big break came when he received top billing in the comedy spoof of spy movies Top Secret!, where he played an American rock and roll star. Kilmer sang all the songs in the film and released an album under the film character's name, \\"Nick Rivers.\\"[18] While garnering more substantial roles and prestige, he also gained a reputation as a ladies man, dating numerous women, some many years older, including Cher and Ellen Barkin.[17]\\r\\nDuring a brief hiatus, he backpacked throughout Europe before going on to play the lead character in the 1985 comedy Real Genius. He turned down a role in David Lynch's Blue Velvet[19] before being cast as naval aviator \\"Iceman\\" in the action film Top Gun alongside Tom Cruise. Top Gun grossed a total of $344,700,000 worldwide and made Kilmer a major star.[20] Following roles in the television films The Murders in the Rue Morgue and The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains, Kilmer played Madmartigan in the fantasy Willow; he met his future wife, co-star Joanne Whalley, on the film's set. Kilmer starred in the Colorado Shakespeare Festival production of Hamlet in 1988. In 1989, Kilmer played the lead in both Kill Me Again, again opposite Whalley, and in TNT's Billy the Kid.\\r\\nAfter several delays, director Oliver Stone finally started production on the film The Doors, based on the band of the same name. Kilmer spoke with Oliver Stone early on, concerned about what he might want to do with the story because Kilmer didn't believe in or want to promote substance abuse. Kilmer saw Morrison as having picked the wrong heroes, who had different issues, that were not part of the creativity or inspiration. Kilmer saw Morrison's story as one that could be told \\"a thousand different ways\\" and didn't want to tell it by playing the role in the style of drugs, with which Oliver Stone agreed.[21] Kilmer memorized the lyrics to all of lead singer Jim Morrison's songs prior to his audition, and sent a video of himself performing some Doors songs to director Stone. Stone was not impressed with the tape, but Paul Rothchild (the original producer of The Doors) said \\"I was shaken by it\\" and suggested they record Kilmer in the studio. After Kilmer was cast as Morrison, he prepared for the role by attending Doors tribute concerts and reading Morrison's poetry.[22]\\r\\nHe spent close to a year before production dressing in Morrison-like clothes, and spent time at Morrison's old hangouts along the Sunset Strip. His portrayal of Morrison was praised and members of The Doors noted that Kilmer did such a convincing job that they had trouble distinguishing his voice from Morrison's. Paul Rothchild played Kilmer's version of \\"The End\\" for the band's guitarist, Robby Krieger, who told him, \\"I'm really glad they got 'The End'. We never got a recording of that live with Jim and now we've got it.\\" However, Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek was less than enthusiastic with how Morrison was portrayed in Stone's interpretation.[23]\\r\\nIn the early 1990s, Kilmer starred in the mystery thriller Thunderheart, the action comedy The Real McCoy, and again teamed with Top Gun director Tony Scott to play Elvis Presley in True Romance, which was written by Quentin Tarantino. In 1993, Kilmer played Doc Holliday in the western Tombstone alongside Kurt Russell. In the film, Doc Holliday performs Chopin's Nocturne in E minor, Op.72, No. 1; however, Kilmer does not play the piano and he practiced that one piece for months in preparation. In 1995, Kilmer starred in Wings of Courage, a 3D IMAX film, and that same year, he starred opposite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat, which is now considered one of the best crime/drama films of the 1990s.[24]\\r\\nIn December 1993, Batman Forever director Joel Schumacher had seen Tombstone and was most impressed with Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday. Schumacher felt him to be perfect for the role of Batman, though at the time, the role was still Michael Keaton's.[25] In July 1994, Keaton decided not to return for a third Batman film after 1992's Batman Returns,[26] due to \\"creative differences\\".[25] William Baldwin (who previously worked with Schumacher on Flatliners) was reported to be a top contender, though just days after Keaton dropped out, Kilmer was cast.[26] Kilmer took the role without even knowing who the new director was and without reading the script.[25]\\r\\nReleased in June 1995, Batman Forever was a success at the box office,[27] despite receiving mixed reviews from critics.[28] There was debate about Kilmer's performance; some critics charged that Kilmer, while physically fit to play Batman, more so than his predecessor Michael Keaton had been, gave a wooden performance as Bruce Wayne. Other critics though, such as Roger Ebert, had kind words for Kilmer. Batman creator Bob Kane said in a Cinescape interview that of all the actors to have played Batman up to that point, he felt Kilmer had given the best interpretation. Film critic Leonard Maltin (who criticized the dark tone contained in Batman Returns) complimented Kilmer's portrayal when he reviewed the film for his expanding collection of film reviews, as well as being very favorable of the film as a whole. Defenders of Batman Forever praised the film for portraying Batman as a more heroic, less ruthless, and more human character than in the Tim Burton films. The film also brought the film interpretation of Bruce Wayne more into line with his comic book counterpart, showing him as a socialite and a very public figure rather than the neurotic recluse of the previous films.\\r\\nIn February 1996, Kilmer decided not to return for another Batman feature film, feeling that Batman was being marginalized in favor of the villains.[29] and because of their scheduling problems with The Saint. George Clooney replaced Kilmer as Batman in 1997's Batman & Robin. There were also reports that Kilmer had not had a good working relationship with Schumacher, as another reason for not reprising the role.[30]\\r\\nIn 1996, he appeared in a largely unknown film, Dead Girl, and starred alongside Marlon Brando in the poorly received[31] The Island of Dr Moreau. That year, Kilmer starred alongside Michael Douglas in the thriller The Ghost and the Darkness. In 1997 he played Simon Templar in the popular action film, The Saint. Kilmer looked forward to the title role as a change toward a more fun, less serious action thriller, while enjoying the \\"master of disguise\\" chameleon characters like a mad artist, a nerdy British scientist, a cleaner, and a Russian mob boss. Kilmer also wrote the poetry in the film.[citation needed] He received a salary of $6?million for the movie.[29] The Saint was a financial success, grossing $169.4?million worldwide.[32]\\r\\nIn 1998, he voiced Moses in the animated film The Prince of Egypt, before starring in the independent film Joe the King (1999). Also in 1999, he played a blind man in the drama/romance At First Sight, which he described as being, of then, the hardest role he had ever had.[33]\\r\\nKilmer's first role in 2000 was in the big budget Warner Bros. box office disaster[34] Red Planet. That same year, he had a supporting role in the film Pollock and hosted Saturday Night Live for the first time. In 2002, he starred in the thriller The Salton Sea, which was generally well-reviewed,[35] but received only a limited release.[36] The same year, he teamed with his True Romance co-star, Christian Slater, and the two starred in the low-budget film, Hard Cash, also known as Run for the Money.\\r\\nIn 2003, Kilmer starred alongside Kate Bosworth in the drama/thriller Wonderland, portraying porn star John Holmes. He also appeared in The Missing, where he again worked with Willow director Ron Howard. The next year, he starred in David Mamet's Spartan, where he played a United States government secret agent who is assigned the task of rescuing the kidnapped daughter of the President. He received Delta Force-like training in preparation for the role.[37] Subsequently, he had a role in the drama, Stateside, and starred (again with Slater) in the thriller Mindhunters, which was filmed in 2003 but not released until 2005. Kilmer next appeared in the big budget Oliver Stone production, Alexander, which received poor reviews.[38]\\r\\nAlso in 2004, Kilmer returned to the theatre to play Moses in a Los Angeles musical production of The Ten Commandments: The Musical, produced by BCBG founder Max Azria.[39] The production played at the Kodak Theater in Hollywood and also featured Adam Lambert. Kilmer had previously played Moses in the animated film The Prince of Egypt. Finally in 2004, Kilmer appeared in an episode of Entourage, where he played a Sherpa whose primary source of income was the growing, harvesting and distributing high-quality cannabis, all under a guise of metaphysical insights.\\r\\nKilmer was in negotiations with Richard Dutcher (a leading director of Mormon-related films) to play the lead role in a film entitled Prophet: The Story of Joseph Smith, although the project never materialized.[40]\\r\\nKilmer performed in The Postman Always Rings Twice on the London stage from June to September 2005.[41] In 2005, he co-starred with Robert Downey, Jr. in the action-comedy film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. His performance was praised and the film was well reviewed,[42] but it received only a limited release.[43] It later won the award for \\"Overlooked Film of the Year\\" from the Phoenix Film Critics Society.\\r\\nIn 2006, he reunited with director Tony Scott a third time for a supporting role opposite Denzel Washington in the box-office hit Dj Vu. The song \\"Val Kilmer\\" was named after him on Bowling for Soup's 2006 album The Great Burrito Extortion Case. The song was later used for a Ford Motors commercial on season 10 of American Idol in 2011. In 2007, he guest-starred on the hit TV series Numb3rs in the episode \\"Trust Metric\\", portraying torture expert Mason Lancer. That same year, he released a CD, proceeds of which went to his charity interests.[citation needed] In 2008, Kilmer starred alongside Stephen Dorff in the Sony and Stage 6 film Felon. The film was given only a limited theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles in 2008, but it developed into a success secondary to positive word of mouth.\\r\\nKilmer was the voice of the car KITT for the 2008 Knight Rider TV pilot film and the following television series. He replaced Will Arnett, who had to step down from the role due to contractual conflict with General Motors. In keeping with tradition established by the original Knight Rider series and original KITT actor William Daniels, Kilmer was uncredited for the role on-screen. He next starred alongside Nicolas Cage in the Werner Herzog film Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, and alongside Curtis \\"50 Cent\\" Jackson in Streets of Blood. Both were released in 2009. He appeared as the main antagonist \\"Mongoose\\" in a live TV series adaptation of the comic/video game of XIII on NBC in 2009.\\r\\nIn 2010, Kilmer starred in the horror film from Michael Oblowitz, The Traveler, where he played the vengeful spirit of a man who had been tortured and murdered while in police custody. In November 2010, Kilmer was filming in Kelseyville, California. He was finally able to work with his lifelong friend Francis Ford Coppola and star in the film Twixt. The film was filmed mostly on Coppola's estate in Napa County. The filming was expected to take five weeks and was being independently funded by Coppola. In 2010, Kilmer appeared as the villain Dieter Von Cunth in MacGruber, and Tenacious D's music video \\"To Be The Best\\" as a small cameo role.\\r\\nKilmer spoke at the May 5, 2010, commencement ceremonies of William Woods University in Fulton, Missouri.[44] During his week-long visit on campus, he also performed his one-man play, Citizen Twain.[45][46] He received an honorary doctorate \\"in recognition of his creative abilities and his contributions to art and theater.\\"[46]\\r\\nIn 2012, Kilmer received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word. He also starred in Harmony Korine's short \\"The Lotus Community Workshop\\" which is part of a collaborative film The Fourth Dimension. He plays a version of himself from an alternate reality, that is a former actor, turned self-help guru. The Fourth Dimension is a collection of three standalone short films about parallel universes produced by Vice Films in collaboration with Grolsch Film Works, a new division of the namesake beer company. Kilmer notes that his addition to the list of actors, including John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) and Al Pacino (Jack and Jill), that mock their real-life persona in fictional movies was an accident and says, \\"I still love saying the premise because it makes me laugh every time.\\"[47]\\r\\nIn 2002, Kilmer worked on a film about the life of Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science church,[48] and Mark Twain, one of her most famous critics. Kilmer is still working on the film, which is about the lives and relationship of Mary Baker Eddy and Mark Twain as \\"a quirky, tender, tragicomic portrait of two contrasting lives, set against the backdrop of Gilded Age America.\\"[49] Citizen Twain was initially performed as a one-man show Hollywood workshop in April 2012; it is now the basis of Kilmer's film project, which will be his directorial debut.[47] In 2013, he reunited with his Top Gun co-star Anthony Edwards in the Disney animated movie Planes. Kilmer voiced the character Bravo, while Edwards supplied Echo. Kilmer also played the role of Detective Dobson in the series finale of the television show Psych.\\r\\nIn 2017, Kilmer appeared in Song to Song opposite Rooney Mara and Ryan Gosling directed by Terrence Malick.[50][51]\\r\\nKevin Spacey told James Lipton on Inside the Actors Studio that one of the turning points of his life was at a high school drama festival when he saw Kilmer and Mare Winningham perform a scene from The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and the drama teacher, Robert Carrelli, invited him to transfer to Chatsworth High School; he accepted. In the same interview, Spacey said he went to Juilliard because Kilmer did. Kilmer was at that time the youngest person ever admitted to Juilliard. During Kilmer's subsequent Inside the Actors Studio interview, he said \\"Robert Carrelli, who was our teacher, had a knack for producing and directing. And it was either Beverly Hills High, because of their very talented pool of students, or Chatsworth High that would win all these festivals.\\"[21]\\r\\nKilmer made several trips to New Orleans to help in the 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster relief.[52] Kilmer is a supporter of Native American affairs and an advocate of environmental protection.[53] He briefly flirted with running for Governor of New Mexico in 2010, but decided not to run.[54]\\r\\nIn May 2013, Kilmer lobbied Congress on behalf of Equitable Access to Care and Health Act, or EACH Act (H.R. 1814), a bill \\"to provide an additional religious exemption from the individual health coverage mandate\\" of Obamacare.[55][56]\\r\\nKilmer was married to actress Joanne Whalley from March 1988 to February 1996. The two met while working together on the film Willow. The couple had two children: a daughter, Mercedes (b. October 29, 1991), and a son, Jack (b. June 6, 1995). Warwick Davis, Kilmer's co-star from the 1988 fantasy Willow, in his audio commentary for the film said that the question he is most asked is what it was like working with Kilmer. Though Kilmer has a reputation of being difficult, Davis describes him as a very funny man and a hard working, dedicated actor. Kilmer reunited with Davis in the 2013 Easter special of the sitcom Life's Too Short, in which he plays a fictionalized version of himself as a mooching, arrogant eccentric.\\r\\nKilmer has gotten into feuds with some of the actors with whom he has worked, notably The Island of Dr. Moreau co-star Marlon Brando and Red Planet co-star Tom Sizemore.[57]\\r\\nOther actors have noted that he prepares for his roles extensively and meticulously. Irwin Winkler (director of At First Sight) talked about his decision to hire Kilmer. \\"I'd heard the stories, so I checked him out. I called Bob De Niro and Michael Mann, who'd worked with him on Heat, and they both gave him raves... I had a wonderful experience in spite of all the naysayers.\\"[58] Jeffrey Katzenberg (producer of Prince of Egypt) talks about the actor: \\"Val was one of the first people cast in The Prince of Egypt. He was there every step of the way; patient, understanding, and phenomenally generous with his time.\\"[59]\\r\\nIn 2011, Kilmer sold his 6,000-acre (24?km2) ranch in New Mexico, where he would track, hike, fish, and raise bison.[48] Kilmer is a devout Christian Scientist. He is also an avid musician; he released a CD in the fall of 2007 and donated its proceeds to his charity interests.\\r\\nIn January 2015, Kilmer was hospitalized for what his representative said were tests for what could be a possible tumor. Kilmer said on social media, \\"I have not had a tumor, or a tumor operations [sic], or any operation. I had a complication where the best way to receive care was to stay under the watchful eye of the UCLA ICU.\\"[60] After previously denying persistent rumors that he had been diagnosed with cancer, Kilmer said in April 2017 that he had a \\"healing of cancer\\".[61]","field3":"Where did val kilmer go to high school?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"after the Second World War","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nA comprehensive school is a secondary school that is a state school and does not select its intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, in contrast to the selective school system, where admission is restricted on the basis of selection criteria. The term is commonly used in relation to England and Wales, where comprehensive schools were introduced on an experimental basis in the 1940s and became more widespread from 1965. About 90% of British secondary school pupils now attend comprehensive schools. They correspond broadly to the public high school in the United States and Canada and to the Gesamtschule in Germany.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nComprehensive schools provide an entitlement curriculum to all children, without selection whether due to financial considerations or attainment. A consequence of that is a wider ranging curriculum, including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational learning, which were less common or non-existent in grammar schools. Providing post-16 education cost-effectively becomes more challenging for smaller comprehensive schools, because of the number of courses needed to cover a broader curriculum with comparatively fewer students. This is why schools have tended to get larger and also why many local authorities have organised secondary education into 11ÿ16 schools, with the post-16 provision provided by sixth form colleges and further education colleges. Comprehensive schools do not select their intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, but there are demographic reasons why the attainment profiles of different schools vary considerably. In addition, government initiatives such as the City Technology Colleges and Specialist schools programmes have made the comprehensive ideal less certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school's specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment. A problem with this is whether the quotas should be taken from a normal distribution or from the specific distribution of attainment in the immediate catchment area. In the selective school system, which survives in several parts of the United Kingdom, admission is dependent on selection criteria, most commonly a cognitive test or tests. Although comprehensive schools were introduced to England and Wales in 1965, there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation.[citation needed] (though this is a small number compared to approximately 3500 state secondary schools in England).\\r\\nMost comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 to 16, but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places the secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US middle school (or junior high school) and high school, respectively. With the advent of key stages in the National Curriculum some local authorities reverted from the Middle School system to 11ÿ16 and 11ÿ18 schools so that the transition between schools corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn principle, comprehensive schools were conceived as \\"neighbourhood\\" schools for all students in a specified catchment area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first comprehensives were set up after the Second World War. In 1946, for example, Walworth School was one of five 'experimental' comprehensive schools set up by the London County Council[1] Another early comprehensive school was Holyhead County School in Anglesey in 1949.[2][3] Coventry opened two Comprehensive School in 1954 by combining Grammar Schools and Secondary Modern Schools. These were Caludon Castle and Woodlands. Another early example was Tividale Comprehensive School in Tipton. The first, purpose-built comprehensive in the North of England was Colne Valley High School near Huddersfield in 1956.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest expansion of comprehensive schools resulted from a policy decision taken in 1965 by Anthony Crosland, Secretary of State for Education in the 1964ÿ1970 Labour government. The policy decision was implemented by Circular 10/65, an instruction to local education authorities to plan for conversion. Students sat the 11+ examination in their last year of primary education and were sent to one of a secondary modern, secondary technical or grammar school depending on their perceived ability. Secondary technical schools were never widely implemented and for 20 years there was a virtual bipartite system which saw fierce competition for the available grammar school places, which varied between 15% and 25% of total secondary places, depending on location.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1970 Margaret Thatcher, the Secretary of State for Education in the new Conservative government, ended the compulsion on local authorities to convert, however, many local authorities were so far down the path that it would have been prohibitively expensive to attempt to reverse the process, and more comprehensive schools were established under Thatcher than any other education secretary.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1975 the majority of local authorities in England and Wales had abandoned the 11-Plus examination and moved to a comprehensive system. Over that 10-year period many secondary modern schools and grammar schools were amalgamated to form large neighbourhood comprehensives, whilst a number of new schools were built to accommodate a growing school population. By the mid-1970s the system had been almost fully implemented, with virtually no secondary modern schools remaining. Many grammar schools were either closed or changed to comprehensive status. Some local authorities, including Sandwell and Dudley in the West Midlands, changed all of its state secondary schools to comprehensive schools during the 1970s. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1976 the future Labour prime minister James Callaghan launched what became known as the 'great debate' on the education system. He went on to list the areas he felt needed closest scrutiny: the case for a core curriculum, the validity and use of informal teaching methods, the role of school inspection and the future of the examination system. Comprehensive school remains the most common type of state secondary school in England, and the only type in Wales. They account for around 90% of pupils, or 64% if one does not count schools with low-level selection. This figure varies by region.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1988 Education Reform Act, parents have a right to choose which school their child should go to or whether to not send them to school at all and to home educate them instead. The concept of \\"school choice\\" introduces the idea of competition between state schools, a fundamental change to the original \\"neighbourhood comprehensive\\" model, and is partly intended as a means by which schools that are perceived to be inferior are forced either to improve or, if hardly anyone wants to go there, to close down. Government policy is currently promoting 'specialisation' whereby parents choose a secondary school appropriate for their child's interests and skills. Most initiatives focus on parental choice and information, implementing a pseudo-market incentive to encourage better schools. This logic has underpinned the controversial league tables of school performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nScotland has a very different educational system from England and Wales, though also based on comprehensive education. It has different ages of transfer, different examinations and a different philosophy of choice and provision. All publicly funded primary and secondary schools are comprehensive. The Scottish Government has rejected plans for specialist schools as of 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation in Northern Ireland differs slightly from systems used elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but it is more similar to that used in England and Wales than it is to Scotland.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the first comprehensive schools appeared in the 1950s, the Australian Government started to transition to comprehensive schooling which has been expanding and improving ever since. Prior to the transition into comprehensive schooling systems, primary and secondary state schools regularly measured students' academic merit based on their performance in public examinations.[4] The state of Western Australia was the first to replace many multilateral school systems, proceeding with Queensland, and finally South Australia and Victoria.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian education system is organised through three compulsory school types. Students commence their education in Primary school, which runs for seven or eight years, starting at kindergarten through to Year 6 or 7. The next is Secondary school which runs for three or four years, from Year 7 or 8 to Year 10. Finally, Senior Secondary school which runs for two years, completing Years 11 and 12.[6] Each school tier follows a comprehensive curriculum that is categorised into sequences for each Year-level. The Year-level follows specific sequence content and achievement for each subject, which can be interrelated through cross-curricula.[7] In order for students to complete and graduate each tier-level of schooling, they need to complete the subject sequences of content and achievement. Once students have completed Year 12, they may choose to enter into Tertiary education. The two-tier Tertiary education system in Australia includes both higher education (i.e.: University, College, other Institutions) and vocational education and training (VET). Higher education works off of the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF)[8] and prepares Australians for an academic route that may take them into the theoretical and philosophical lenses of their career options.","field3":"When was the first comprehensive school opened in england?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Emma Martina Luigia Morano","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Emma Martina Luigia Morano (OMRI[3]) (29 November 1899 ÿ 15 April 2017) was an Italian supercentenarian who, before her death at the age of 117 years and 137 days, was the world's oldest living person whose age had been verified, and the last living person to have been verified as being born in the 1800s.[a][4] She remains the oldest Italian person ever[5] and the second oldest European person ever behind Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma Martina Luigia Morano was born on 29 November 1899 in Civiasco, Vercelli, Piedmont, Italy, to Giovanni Morano and Matilde Bresciani,[7] the eldest of eight children (five daughters and three sons). She had a long-lived family: her mother, an aunt and some of her siblings turned 90, and one of her sisters, Angela Morano (1908ÿ2011),[8] died at age 102.\\r\\nWhen she was a child she moved from the Sesia Valley to Ossola for her father's job,[9] but the climate was so unhealthy there that a physician advised her family to live somewhere with more moderate weather, so she moved to Verbania, on Lake Maggiore, where she lived the rest of her life. In October 1926, she married Giovanni Martinuzzi[10] (1901ÿ1978), and her only child was born in 1937 but died when he was only six months old. The marriage was not a happy one,[11] so in 1938 Morano separated from her husband, driving him out of the house; he died in 1978.[12]\\r\\nUntil 1954 Morano worked at Maioni Industry, a jute factory in her town. She subsequently worked in the kitchen of Collegio Santa Maria, a Marianist boarding school in Verbania, until her retirement at the age of 75.[7]\\r\\nIn December 2011 she was awarded the honor of Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by President Giorgio Napolitano.[3]\\r\\nIn 2013, when asked about the secret of her longevity, she said that she ate three eggs a day, drank a glass of homemade grappa, and enjoyed a chocolate sometimes, but, above all, she thought positively about the future.[13] She was still living alone in her home on her 115th birthday.[14] In 2016 she credited her long life to her diet of raw eggs and cookies, and to staying single.[15][16]\\r\\nMorano became the oldest living person in Italy and Europe after the death of Maria Redaelli on 2 April 2013.[10] On her 114th birthday, she gave a short live TV interview to a RAI show.[17] On her 116th birthday, Morano received congratulations from Pope Francis.[18]\\r\\nShe surpassed the age of Venere Pizzinato in August 2014 and Dina Manfredini (who died in the United States) in August 2015, to become the oldest Italian person ever.[5][19] On 13 May 2016,[b] upon the death of American woman Susannah Mushatt Jones, Morano became the world's oldest living person and also the last living person verified to have been born in the 1800s.[21] On 29 July 2016, she was presented with a certificate from Guinness World Records recognizing her as the oldest person alive.[22][23] Festivities celebrating her 117th birthday on 29 November 2016 were broadcast live in Italy.[24]\\r\\nMorano died at her home in Verbania, Italy, on 15 April 2017 at the age of 117.[25][26] At the time she was the oldest person alive and the fifth oldest person in recorded history.[27][28] She was recognised as the last living person born in the 1800s whose age had been independently verified.[29][30] Upon Morano's death, Violet Brown became the world's oldest living person.[31][32]","field3":"Who was the last person born in 1899?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"3 September 1939","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The Declaration of war by France and the United Kingdom was given on 3 September 1939, after German forces invaded Poland.

Yet I cannot believe that there is anything more or anything different that I could have done and that would have been more successful.\\r\\nUp to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honourable settlement between Germany and Poland, but Hitler would not have it.\\r\\nHe had evidently made up his mind to attack Poland whatever happened; and although he now says he put forward reasonable proposals which were rejected by the Poles, that is not a true statement.\\r\\nThe proposals were never shown to the Poles nor to us; and though they were announced in a German broadcast on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear comments on them, but ordered his troops to cross the Polish frontier the next morning.\\r\\nHis action shows convincingly that there is no chance of expecting that this man will ever give up his practice of using force to gain his will. He can only be stopped by force, and we and France are today, in fulfilment of our obligations, going to the aid of Poland, who is so bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack upon her people. We have a clear conscience. We have done all that any country could do to establish peace. The situation in which no word given by Germanys ruler could be trusted and no people or country could feel itself safe has become intolerable.\\r\\nAnd now that we have resolved to finish it, I know that you will all play your part with calmness and courage.\\r\\nAt such a moment as this the assurances of support that we have received from the Empire are a source of profound encouragement to us.\\r\\nWhen I have finished speaking certain detailed announcements will be made on behalf of the Government.

It is the evil things that we shall be fighting against ÿ brute force, bad faith, injustice, oppression and persecution ÿ and against them I am certain that the right will prevail.\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the First World War, the German Empire signed the First Armistice at Compigne on 11 November 1918 as an end to hostilities with France, the British Empire, and the United States during the convoluted German Revolution of 1918ÿ19, which began 29 October 1918.\\r\\nNegotiations between the Allied powers regarding post-war Europe started on 18 January 1919 in the Salle de l'Horloge at the French Foreign Ministry on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris. Seventy delegates from 27 nations participated in the negotiations. The opposing nations of the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were excluded from the negotiations. At first a \\"Council of Ten\\" comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy and Japan met officially to decide the peace terms. It became the \\"Big Four\\" when Japan dropped out and the top person from each of the other four nations met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions to be ratified by the entire assembly. In June 1919, the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty they had agreed to among themselves. The government headed by Philipp Scheidemann was unable to agree on a common position, and Scheidemann himself resigned rather than agree to sign the treaty. Gustav Bauer, the head of the new government, sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn, including articles 227, 230 and 231. In response, the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within 24 hours. On 23 June 1919, Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty.\\r\\nOn 28 June 1919, Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, a peace treaty which ended the formal state of war and imposed various punitive measures upon Germany, including military restriction, loss of territory and colonies, war debt, and effective acceptance of blame for the initiation of hostilities in World War I. At the time of the armistice, an attempted Communist revolution transpired (October 1918-August 1919), resulting in the abdication of the Emperor of Germany in November 1918, and what became known as the Weimar Republic was subsequently established in the wake of the uprising. The transition from monarchy to republic was difficult, and many in the new government were not supportive of the democratic system of government. The officer class gave little support to the Republic, and Germany was forced to borrow money from the United States and others to pay its war debt, imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. In the early 1920s a period of hyperinflation made the Reichsmark almost worthless. In January 1922, one US dollar was worth 191 Marks, but by November of the same year it was equal to 4,200,000,000 Marks.[2]\\r\\nIn 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of the Reich following a contentious election. Under Hitler's leadership, the Reichstag turned the government into an effective dictatorship under Hitler's oversight on 21 March 1933 with the passage of the Enabling Act of 1933, and the economic hardships were significantly diminished via implementation of new economic and social policies. After five years in power, Hitler annexed Austria, former component of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (allies of the former German Empire), into Germany, despite such an act (specifically, \\"prohibition on the merging of Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations\\") being banned by both the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the Treaty of Versailles. In early November 1938, the First Vienna Award was signed, allowing Germany to seize the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia which had been a part of the German Empire-allied Austro-Hungarian Empire. Soon after, Germany invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia and also gained Memelland (part of the former German Empire from 1871-1920) through the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania.\\r\\nWhile some sources claim Hitler still wanted more, to create Lebensraum, or \\"living space\\", for Germany, other sources claim evidence of hostility on behalf of Polish partisans toward ethnic Germans in the Danzig Corridor (territory lost to Germany as a result of the Treaty of Versailles) which may have served as a motivating factor for the German invasion (often portrayed as propaganda to justify German expansionism).\\r\\nTwo Western powers, the United Kingdom and France, gave guarantees to Poland that they would declare war if Polish independence came under threat, as presented in a statement to the House of Commons by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 31 March 1939 (formalized by the British 6 April 1939; not ratified until 4 September 1939 by the French):\\r\\n... in the event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence, and which the Polish Government accordingly considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty's Government would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Polish Government all support in their power. They have given the Polish Government an assurance to this effect.\\r\\nI may add that the French Government have authorised me to make it plain that they stand in the same position in this matter as do His Majesty's Government.[3]\\r\\nAlthough they honoured these guarantees by declaring war soon after Germany's Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939,[4] and although the dominions of the British Empire quickly followed suit, so little practical assistance was given to Poland, which was soon defeated, that in its early stages the war declared by Britain and France was described as a \\"Phoney War\\".\\r\\nFurther, neither the British Empire, nor the French, ever declared war upon the Soviet Union, which invaded Poland on 17 September 1939 (17 days after Nazi Germany invaded from the West) and held sway over the former-Polish territory at the war's conclusion, having become a part of the Allied front in the course of World War II. At the insistence of Joseph Stalin, the post-war Yalta Conference in 1945 sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the Polish government-in-exile based in London.\\r\\nThe following excerpts of the speech were sampled by the drum and bass artist S.P.Y. in his remix of Black Sun Empire's track \\"Potemkin\\":[5]\\r\\n- \\"that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us\\"\\r\\n- \\"I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany\\",","field3":"When did britian and france declare war on germany?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Alaska","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grizzly bear (Ursus arctos ssp.) is a large population of the brown bear inhabiting North America. Scientists generally do not use the name grizzly bear but call it the North American brown bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple morphological forms sometimes recognized as subspecies exist, including the mainland grizzly (Ursus arctos horribilis), Kodiak bear (U. a. middendorffi), peninsular grizzly (U. a. gyas), and the recently extinct California grizzly (U. a. californicus?)[1][2] and Mexican grizzly bear (U. a. nelsoni?). On average bears near the coast tend to be larger while inland grizzlies tend to be smaller.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ussuri brown bear (U. a. lasiotus) inhabiting Russia, Northern China, and Korea[3][4][5] is sometimes referred to as the black grizzly, although it is a different subspecies from the bears in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeriwether Lewis and William Clark first described it as grisley, which could be interpreted as either \\"grizzly\\" (i.e., \\"grizzled\\"that is, with golden and grey tips of the hair) or \\"grisly\\" (\\"fear-inspiring\\", now usually \\"gruesome\\").[6] The modern spelling supposes the former meaning; even so, naturalist George Ord formally classified it in 1815 as U. horribilis, not for its hair, but for its character.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nClassification has been revised along genetic lines.[1] There are two morphological forms of Ursus arctos, the grizzly and the coastal brown bears, but these morphological forms do not have distinct mtDNA lineages.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown bears originated in Eurasia and traveled to North America approximately 50,000 years ago,[9][10] spreading into the contiguous United States about 13,000 years ago.[11]\\r\\nIn the 19th century, the grizzly was classified as 86 distinct species. However, by 1928 only seven grizzlies remained[2] and by 1953 only one species remained globally.[12] However, modern genetic testing reveals the grizzly to be a subspecies of the brown bear (Ursus arctos). Rausch found that North America has but one species of grizzly.[13] Therefore, everywhere it is the \\"brown bear\\"; in North America, it is the \\"grizzly\\", but these are all the same species, Ursus arctos.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963 Rausch reduced the number of North American subspecies to one, Ursus arctos middendorffi[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther testing of Y-chromosomes is required to yield an accurate new taxonomy with different subspecies.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoastal grizzlies, often referred to by the popular but geographically redundant synonym of \\"brown bear\\" or \\"Alaskan brown bear\\" are larger and darker than inland grizzlies, which is why they, too, were considered a different species from grizzlies. Kodiak grizzly bears were also at one time considered distinct. Therefore, at one time there were five different \\"species\\" of brown bear, including three in North America.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost adult female grizzlies weigh 130ÿ180?kg (290ÿ400?lb), while adult males weigh on average 180ÿ360?kg (400ÿ790?lb).  Average total length in this subspecies is 198?cm (6.50?ft), with an average shoulder height of 102?cm (3.35?ft) and hindfoot length of 28?cm (11?in).[16] Newborn bears may weigh less than 500 grams (1.1?lb). In the Yukon River area, mature female grizzlies can weigh as little as 100?kg (220?lb). One study found that the average weight for an inland male grizzly was around 272?kilograms (600?lb) and the average weight for a coastal male was around 408?kilograms (900?lb). For a female, these average weights would be 136?kilograms (300?lb) inland and 227?kilograms (500?lb) coastal, respectively.[17] On the other hand, an occasional huge male grizzly has been recorded which greatly exceeds ordinary size, with weights reported up to 680?kg (1,500?lb).[18] A large coastal male of this size may stand up to 3 metres (9.8?ft) tall on its hind legs and be up to 1.5 metres (4.9?ft) at the shoulder.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough variable in color from blond to nearly black, grizzly bear fur is typically brown with darker legs and commonly white or blond tipped fur on the flank and back.[20] A pronounced hump appears on their shoulders; the hump is a good way to distinguish a grizzly bear from a black bear, as black bears do not have this hump. Aside from the distinguishing hump a grizzly bear can be identified by a \\"dished in\\" profile of their face with short, rounded ears, whereas a black bear has a straight face profile and longer ears.[21] A grizzly bear can also be identified by its rump, which is lower than its shoulders, while a black bear's rump is higher.[21] A grizzly bear's front claws measure about 2ÿ4 inches in length and a black bear's measure about 1ÿ2 inches in length.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown bears are found in Asia, Europe, and North America, giving them the widest ranges of bear species.[2] They also inhabited North Africa and the Middle East.[22] In North America, grizzly bears previously ranged from Alaska down to Mexico and as far east as the western shores of Hudson Bay;[9] the species is now found in Alaska, south through much of western Canada, and into portions of the northwestern United States (including Idaho, Montana, Washington, and Wyoming), extending as far south as Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. It is most commonly found in Canada. In Canada, there are approximately 25,000 grizzly bears occupying British Columbia, Alberta,  the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the northern part of Manitoba.[9] An article published in 1954 suggested they may be present in the tundra areas of the Ungava Peninsula and the northern tip of Labrador-Quebec.[23] In British Columbia, grizzly bears inhabit approximately 90% of their original territory. There were approximately 25,000 grizzly bears in British Columbia when the European settlers arrived.[9] However, population size has since significantly decreased due to hunting and habitat loss. In 2003, researchers from the University of Alberta spotted a grizzly on Melville Island in the high Arctic, which is the most northerly sighting ever documented.[24][25] In 2008, it was estimated there were 16,014 grizzly bears.  Population estimates for British Columbia are based on hair-snagging, DNA-based inventories, mark-and-recapture, and a refined multiple regression model.[26] A revised Grizzly bear count in 2012 for British Columbia was 15,075.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Alaskan population of 30,000 individuals is the highest population of any province/state in North America. Populations in Alaska are densest along the coast, where food supplies such as salmon are more abundant.[28] The Admiralty Island National Monument protects the densest population1,600 bears on a 1,600-square mile island.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are currently about 55,000 wild grizzly bears total located throughout North America, most of which reside in Alaska.[9] Only about 1,500 grizzlies are left in the lower 48 states of the US.[30] Of these, about 800 live in Montana.[31] About 600 more live in Wyoming, in the Yellowstone-Teton area.[32] There are an estimated 70ÿ100 grizzly bears living in northern and eastern Idaho. Its original range included much of the Great Plains and the southwestern states, but it has been extirpated in most of those areas. Combining Canada and the United States, grizzly bears inhabit approximately half the area of their historical range.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the once-abundant grizzly bear (see California grizzly bear) appears prominently on the state flag of California and was the symbol of the Bear Flag Republic before California's admission to the Union, they are no longer naturally present.  The last grizzly in all of California was killed in the Sierra foothills east of Fresno in August 1922.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2007, a hunter produced evidence of one bear in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness ecosystem, by killing a male grizzly bear there.[34] In the North Cascades ecosystem of northern Washington, grizzly bear populations are estimated to be fewer than 20 bears. One sighting of a grizzly bear in 2010 has been recorded.[35] There has been no confirmed sighting of a grizzly in Colorado since 1979.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther provinces and the United States may use a combination of methods for population estimates. Therefore, it is difficult to say precisely what methods were used to produce total population estimates for Canada and North America, as they were likely developed from a variety of studies. The grizzly bear currently has legal protection in Mexico, European countries, some areas of Canada and in the United States. However, it is expected that repopulating its former range will be a slow process, due to a variety of reasons including the bear's slow reproductive habits and the effects of reintroducing such a large animal to areas prized for agriculture and livestock. Competition with other predators and predation on cubs are other possible limiting factors for grizzly bear recovery, though grizzly bears also benefit from scavenged carcasses from predators as an easy food source when other food sources decline.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzly bears hibernate for 5ÿ7 months each year[37] except where the climate is warm, as the California grizzly did not hibernate.[2] During this time, female grizzly bears give birth to their offspring, who then consume milk from their mother and gain strength for the remainder of the hibernation period.[38] To prepare for hibernation, grizzlies must prepare a den, and consume an immense amount of food as they do not eat during hibernation. Grizzly bears do not defecate or urinate throughout the entire hibernation period. The male grizzly bear's hibernation ends in early to mid-March, while females emerge in April or early May.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn preparation for winter, bears can gain approximately 180?kg (400?lb), during a period of hyperphagia, before going into hibernation.[40] The bear often waits for a substantial snowstorm before it enters its den: such behavior lessens the chances predators will find the den. The dens are typically at elevations above 1,800?m (5,900?ft) on north-facing slopes.[41] There is some debate amongst professionals as to whether grizzly bears technically hibernate: much of this debate revolves around body temperature and the ability of the bears to move around during hibernation on occasion. Grizzly bears can \\"partially\\" recycle their body wastes during this period.[42] Although inland or Rocky Mountain grizzlies spend nearly half of their life in dens, coastal grizzlies with better access to food sources spend less time in dens. In some areas where food is very plentiful year round, grizzly bears skip hibernation altogether.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept for females with cubs,[44] grizzlies are normally solitary, active animals, but in coastal areas, grizzlies gather around streams, lakes, rivers, and ponds during the salmon spawn. Every other year, females (sows) produce one to four young (usually two) that are small and weigh only about 450 grams (1?lb) at birth. A sow is protective of her offspring and will attack if she thinks she or her cubs are threatened.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzly bears have one of the lowest reproductive rates of all terrestrial mammals in North America.[45] This is due to numerous ecological factors. Grizzly bears do not reach sexual maturity until they are at least five years old.[9][46] Once mated with a male in the summer, the female delays embryo implantation until hibernation, during which miscarriage can occur if the female does not receive the proper nutrients and caloric intake.[47] On average, females produce two cubs in a litter[46] and the mother cares for the cubs for up to two years, during which the mother will not mate.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the young leave or are killed, females may not produce another litter for three or more years, depending on environmental conditions.[48] Male grizzly bears have large territories, up to 4,000?km2 (1,500?sq?mi),[45] making finding a female scent difficult in such low population densities. Population fragmentation of grizzlies may destabilize the population from inbreeding depression. The gestation period for grizzly bears is approximately 180ÿ250 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nLitter size is between one and four cubs, averaging twins or triplets. Cubs are always born in the mother's winter den while she is in hibernation. Female grizzlies are fiercely protective of their cubs, being able to fend off predators as large as male bears bigger than they are in defense of the cubs.[49] Cubs feed entirely on their mother's milk until summer comes, after which they still drink milk but begin to eat solid foods. Cubs gain weight rapidly during their time with the mothertheir weight will have ballooned from 4.5 to 45?kg (10 to 99?lb) in the two years spent with the mother. Mothers may see their cubs in later years but both avoid each other.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grizzly bear is, by nature, a long-living animal. The average lifespan for a male is estimated at 22 years, with that of a female being slightly longer at 26.[51] Females live longer than males due to their less dangerous life; avoiding the seasonal breeding fights in which males engage. The oldest wild inland grizzly was 34 years old in Alaska; the oldest coastal bear was 39,[52] but most grizzlies die in their first few years of life from predation or hunting.[53] Captive grizzlies have lived as long as 44 years.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough grizzlies are of the order Carnivora and have the digestive system of carnivores, they are normally omnivores: their diets consist of both plants and animals. They have been known to prey on large mammals, when available, such as moose, elk, caribou, white-tailed deer, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, and even black bears; though they are more likely to take calves and injured individuals rather than healthy adults. Grizzly bears feed on fish such as salmon, trout, and bass, and those with access to a more protein-enriched diet in coastal areas potentially grow larger than inland individuals. Grizzly bears also readily scavenge food or carrion left behind by other animals.[54] Grizzly bears will also eat birds and their eggs, and gather in large numbers at fishing sites to feed on spawning salmon. They frequently prey on baby deer left in the grass, and occasionally they raid the nests of raptors such as bald eagles.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian or Alaskan grizzlies are larger than those that reside in the American Rocky Mountains. This is due, in part, to the richness of their diets. In Yellowstone National Park in the United States, the grizzly bear's diet consists mostly of whitebark pine nuts, tubers, grasses, various rodents, army cutworm moths, and scavenged carcasses.[56]  None of these, however, match the fat content of the salmon available in Alaska and British Columbia. With the high fat content of salmon, it is not uncommon to encounter grizzlies in Alaska weighing 540?kg (1,200?lb).[57] Grizzlies in Alaska supplement their diet of salmon and clams with sedge grass and berries. In areas where salmon are forced to leap waterfalls, grizzlies gather at the base of the falls to feed on and catch the fish. Salmon are at a disadvantage when they leap waterfalls because they cluster together at their bases and are therefore easier targets for the grizzlies.[58] Grizzly bears are well-documented catching leaping salmon in their mouths at Brooks Falls in Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska. They are also very experienced in chasing the fish around and pinning them with their claws.[59][60] At such sites such as Brooks Falls and McNeil Falls in Alaska, big male grizzlies fight regularly for the best fishing spots.[61] Grizzly bears along the coast also forage for razor clams, and frequently dig into the sand to seek them.[62] During the spring and fall, directly before and after the salmon runs, berries and grass make up the mainstay of the diets of coastal grizzlies.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nInland grizzlies may eat fish too, most notably in Yellowstone grizzlies eating Yellowstone cutthroat trout.[64] The relationship with cutthroat trout and grizzlies is unique because it is the only example where Rocky Mountain grizzlies feed on spawning salmonid fish.[64] However, grizzly bears themselves and invasive lake trout threaten the survival of the trout population and there is a slight chance that the trout will be eliminated.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeat, as already described, is an important part of a grizzly's diet. Grizzly bears occasionally prey on small mammals, such as marmots, ground squirrels, lemmings, and voles.[66] The most famous example of such predation is in Denali National Park and Preserve, where grizzlies chase, pounce on, and dig up Arctic ground squirrels to eat.[67] In some areas, grizzly bears prey on hoary marmots, overturning rocks to reach them, and in some cases preying on them when they are in hibernation.[68] Larger prey includes bison and moose, which are sometimes taken by bears in Yellowstone National Park. Because bison and moose are dangerous prey, grizzlies usually use cover to stalk them and/or pick off weak individuals or calves.[69][70] Grizzlies in Alaska also regularly prey on moose calves, which in Denali National Park may be their main source of meat. In fact, grizzly bears are such important predators of moose and elk calves in Alaska and in Yellowstone, that they may kill as many as 51 percent of elk or moose calves born that year. Grizzly bears have also been blamed in the decline of elk in Yellowstone National Park when the actual predators were thought to be gray wolves.[71][72][73][74][75] In northern Alaska, grizzlies are a significant predator of caribou, mostly taking sick or old individuals or calves.[76] Several studies show that grizzly bears may follow the caribou herds year-round in order to maintain their food supply.[77][78] In northern Alaska, grizzly bears often encounter muskox. Despite the fact that muskox do not usually occur in grizzly habitat and that they are bigger and more powerful than caribou, predation on muskox by grizzlies has been recorded.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzly bears along the Alaskan coast also scavenge on dead or washed up whales.[80] Usually such incidents involve only one or two grizzlies at a carcass, but up to ten large males have been seen at a time eating a dead humpback whale. Dead seals and sea lions are also consumed.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the diets of grizzly bears vary extensively based on seasonal and regional changes, plants make up a large portion of them, with some estimates as high as 80ÿ90%.[81] Various berries constitute an important food source when they are available. These can include blueberries, blackberries (Rubus fruticosus), salmon berries (Rubus spectabilis), cranberries (Vaccinium oxycoccos), buffalo berries (Shepherdia argentea), soapberries (Shepherdia canadensis), and huckleberries (Vaccinium parvifolium), depending on the environment. Insects such as ladybugs, ants, and bees are eaten if they are available in large quantities. In Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears may obtain half of their yearly caloric needs by feeding on miller moths that congregate on mountain slopes.[82] When food is abundant, grizzly bears will feed in groups. For example, many grizzly bears will visit meadows right after an avalanche or glacier slide. This is due to an influx of legumes, such as Hedysarum, which the grizzlies consume in massive amounts.[83] When food sources become scarcer, however, they separate once again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe removal of wolves and the grizzly bear in California may have greatly reduced the abundance of the endangered San Joaquin Kit Fox.[84] With the reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone, many visitors have witnessed a once common struggle between a keystone species, the grizzly bear, and its historic rival, the gray wolf. The interactions of grizzly bears with the wolves of Yellowstone have been under considerable study. Typically, the conflict will be in the defense of young or over a carcass, which is commonly an elk killed by wolves.[85] The grizzly bear uses its keen sense of smell to locate the kill. As the wolves and grizzly compete for the kill, one wolf may try to distract the bear while the others feed. The bear then may retaliate by chasing the wolves. If the wolves become aggressive with the bear, it is normally in the form of quick nips at its hind legs. Thus, the bear will sit down and use its ability to protect itself in a full circle. Rarely do interactions such as these end in death or serious injury to either animal. One carcass simply is not usually worth the risk to the wolves (if the bear has the upper hand due to strength and size) or to the bear (if the wolves are too numerous or persistent).[86] While wolves usually dominate grizzly bears during interactions at wolf dens, both grizzly and black bears have been reported killing wolves and their cubs at wolf dens even when the latter was in defense mode.[87][88]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack bears generally stay out of grizzly territory, but grizzlies may occasionally enter black bear terrain to obtain food sources both bears enjoy, such as pine nuts, acorns, mushrooms, and berries. When a black bear sees a grizzly coming, it either turns tail and runs or climbs a tree. Black bears are not strong competition for prey because they have a more herbivorous diet. Confrontations are rare because of the differences in size, habitats, and diets of the bear species. When this happens, it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor. The black bear will only fight when it is a smaller grizzly such as a yearling or when the black bear has no other choice but to defend itself. There is at least one confirmed observation of a grizzly bear digging out, killing and eating a black bear when the latter was in hibernation.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe segregation of black bear and grizzly bear populations is possibly due to competitive exclusion. In certain areas, grizzly bears outcompete black bears for the same resources.[90] For example, many Pacific coastal islands off British Columbia and Alaska support either the black bear or the grizzly, but rarely both.[91] In regions where both species coexist, they are divided by landscape gradients such as age of forest, elevation and openness of land. Grizzly bears tend to favor old forests with high productivity, higher elevations and more open habitats compared with black bears.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between grizzly bears and other predators is mostly one-sided; grizzly bears will approach feeding predators to steal their kill. In general, the other species will leave the carcasses for the bear to avoid competition or predation. Any parts of the carcass left uneaten are scavenged by smaller animals.[92] Cougars generally give the bears a wide berth. Grizzlies have less competition with cougars than with other predators, such as coyotes, wolves, and other bears. When a grizzly descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually gives way to the bear. When a cougar does stand its ground, it will use its superior agility and its claws to harass the bear, yet stay out of its reach until one of them gives up. Grizzly bears occasionally kill cougars in disputes over kills.[93] There have been several accounts, primarily from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of cougars and grizzly bears killing each other in fights to the death.[94] The other big cat that is present in the United States, which may pose as a threat to bears, is the jaguar.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoyotes, foxes, and wolverines are generally regarded as pests to the grizzlies rather than competition, though they may compete for smaller prey, such as ground squirrels and rabbits. All three will try to scavenge whatever they can from the bears. Wolverines are aggressive enough to occasionally persist until the bear finishes eating, leaving more scraps  than normal for the smaller animal.[92] Packs of coyotes have also displaced grizzly bears in disputes over kills.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grizzly bear has several relationships with its ecosystem. One such relationship is a mutualistic relationship with fleshy-fruit bearing plants. After the grizzly consumes the fruit, the seeds are excreted and thereby dispersed in a germinable condition. Some studies have shown germination success is indeed increased as a result of seeds being deposited along with nutrients in feces.[97] This makes grizzly bears important seed distributors in their habitats.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile foraging for tree roots, plant bulbs, or ground squirrels, bears stir up the soil. This process not only helps grizzlies access their food, but also increases species richness in alpine ecosystems.[99] An area that contains both bear digs and undisturbed land has greater plant diversity than an area that contains just undisturbed land.[99] Along with increasing species richness, soil disturbance causes nitrogen to be dug up from lower soil layers, and makes nitrogen more readily available in the environment. An area that has been dug by the grizzly bear has significantly more nitrogen than an undisturbed area.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nNitrogen cycling is not only facilitated by grizzlies digging for food, it is also accomplished via their habit of carrying salmon carcasses into surrounding forests.[101] It has been found that spruce tree (Picea glauca) foliage within 500?m (1,600?ft) of the stream where the salmon have been obtained contains nitrogen originating from salmon on which the bears preyed.[102] These nitrogen influxes to the forest are directly related to the presence of grizzly bears and salmon.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzlies directly regulate prey populations and also help prevent overgrazing in forests by controlling the populations of other species in the food chain.[104] An experiment in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in the United States showed removal of wolves and grizzly bears caused populations of their herbivorous prey to increase.[105] This, in turn, changed the structure and density of plants in the area, which decreased the population sizes of migratory birds.[105] This provides evidence grizzly bears represent a keystone predator, having a major influence on the entire ecosystem they inhabit.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen grizzly bears fish for salmon along the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia, they often only eat the skin, brain and roe of the fish. In doing so, they provide a food source for gulls, ravens, and foxes, all of which eat salmon as well; this benefits both the bear and the smaller predators.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzlies are considered more aggressive compared to black bears when defending themselves and their offspring.[107] Unlike the smaller black bears, adult grizzlies do not climb trees well and respond to danger by standing their ground and warding off their attackers.[108] Mothers defending cubs are the most prone to attacking, and are responsible for 70% of humans killed by grizzlies.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzly bears normally avoid contact with people. In spite of their obvious physical advantage they rarely actively hunt humans.[110] Most grizzly bear attacks result from a bear that has been surprised at very close range, especially if it has a supply of food to protect, or female grizzlies protecting their offspring.[111]  A bear killing a human in a national park may be killed to prevent its attacking again.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nExacerbating this is the fact that intensive human use of grizzly habitat coincides with the seasonal movement of grizzly bears.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreased humanÿbear interaction has created \\"problem bears\\": bears adapted to human activities or habitat.[113] Aversive conditioning using rubber bullets, foul-tasting chemicals, or acoustic deterrent devices attempt to condition bears to associate humans with unpleasantness, but is ineffectual when bears have already learned to positively associate humans with food.[114] Such bears are translocated or killed because they pose a threat to humans. The B.C. government kills approximately 50 problem bears each year[114] and overall spends more than one million dollars annually to address bear complaints, relocate bears and kill them.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nBear awareness programs have been developed by numerous towns in British Columbia, Canada, to help prevent conflicts with both black and grizzly bears. The main premise of these programs is to teach humans to manage foods that attract bears. Keeping garbage securely stored, harvesting fruit when ripe, securing livestock behind electric fences, and storing pet food indoors are all measures promoted by bear awareness programs.   The fact that grizzly bears are less numerous and even protected in some areas, means that preventing conflict with grizzlies is especially important.  Revelstoke, British Columbia is a community that demonstrates the success of this approach.  In the ten years preceding the development of a community education program in Revelstoke, 16 grizzlies were destroyed and a further 107 were relocated away from the town.  An education program run by Revelstoke Bear Aware was put in place in 1996. Since the program began just four grizzlies have been eliminated and five have been relocated.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor back-country campers, hanging food between trees at a height unreachable to bears is a common procedure, although some grizzlies can climb and reach hanging food in other ways. An alternative to hanging food is to use a bear canister.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraveling in groups of six or more can significantly reduce the chance of bear-related injuries while hiking in bear country.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzly bears are especially dangerous because of the force of their bite, which has been measured at over 8 megapascals (1160 psi). It has been estimated that a bite from a grizzly could even crush a bowling ball.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grizzly bear is listed as threatened in the contiguous United States and endangered in parts of Canada. In May 2002, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Prairie population (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba range) of grizzly bears as extirpated in Canada.[119] As of 2002, grizzly bears were listed as special concern under the COSEWIC registry[120] and considered threatened under the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concentrates its effort to restore grizzly bears in six recovery areas. These are Northern Continental Divide (Montana), Yellowstone (Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho), Cabinet-Yaak (Montana and Idaho), Selway-Bitterroot (Montana and Idaho), Selkirk (Idaho and Washington), and North Cascades (Washington). The grizzly population in these areas is estimated at 750 in the Northern Continental Divide, 550 in Yellowstone, 40 in the Yaak portion of the Cabinet-Yaak, and 15 in the Cabinet portion (in northwestern Montana), 105 in Selkirk region of Idaho, 10ÿ20 in the North Cascades, and none currently in Selway-Bitterroots, although there have been sightings.[122] These are estimates because bears move in and out of these areas, and it is therefore impossible to conduct a precise count. In the recovery areas that adjoin Canada, bears also move back and forth across the international boundary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service claims the Cabinet-Yaak and Selkirk areas are linked through British Columbia, a claim that is disputed.[123] U.S. and Canadian national parks, such as Banff National Park, Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and Theodore Roosevelt National Park are subject to laws and regulations designed to protect the bears.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 January 2006, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to remove Yellowstone grizzlies from the list of threatened and protected species.[124] In March 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \\"de-listed\\" the population,[125] effectively removing Endangered Species Act protections for grizzlies in the Yellowstone National Park area. Several environmental organizations, including the NRDC, brought a lawsuit against the federal government to relist the grizzly bear. On 22 September 2009, U.S. District Judge Donald W. Molloy reinstated protection due to the decline of whitebark pine tree, whose nuts are an important source of food for the bears.[126] In 1996 the International Union for Conservation of Nature moved the grizzly bear to the lower risk \\"Least Concern\\" status on the IUCN Red List.[127][128]\\r\\n\\r\\nFarther north, in Alberta, Canada, intense DNA hair-snagging studies in 2000 showed the grizzly population to be increasing faster than what it was formerly believed to be, and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development calculated a population of 841 bears.[129] In 2002, the Endangered Species Conservation Committee recommended that the Alberta grizzly bear population be designated as threatened due to recent estimates of grizzly bear mortality rates that indicated the population was in decline. A recovery plan released by the provincial government in March 2008 indicated the grizzly population is lower than previously believed.[130] In 2010, the provincial government formally listed its population of about 700 grizzlies as \\"Threatened\\".[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvironment Canada consider the grizzly bear to a \\"special concern\\" species, as it is particularly sensitive to human activities and natural threats. In Alberta and British Columbia, the species is considered to be at risk.[132] In 2008, it was estimated there were 16,014 grizzly bears in the British Columbia population, which was lower than previously estimated due to refinements in the population model.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mexican grizzly bear (Ursus arctos nelsoni) is extinct.[134][135]\\r\\n\\r\\nConservation efforts have become an increasingly vital investment over recent decades, as population numbers have dramatically declined. Establishment of parks and protected areas are one of the main focuses currently being tackled to help reestablish the low grizzly bear population in British Columbia. One example of these efforts is the Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary located along the north coast of British Columbia; at 44,300 hectares (109,000 acres) in size, it is composed of key habitat for this threatened species. Regulations such as limited public access, as well as a strict no hunting policy, have enabled this location to be a safe haven for local grizzlies in the area.[136] When choosing the location of a park focused on grizzly bear conservation, factors such as habitat quality and connectivity to other habitat patches are considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Refuge for Endangered Wildlife located on Grouse Mountain in Vancouver is an example of a different type of conservation effort for the diminishing grizzly bear population. The refuge is a five-acre terrain which has functioned as a home for two orphaned grizzly bears since 2001.[137] The purpose of this refuge is to provide awareness and education to the public about grizzly bears, as well as providing an area for research and observation of this secluded species.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother factor currently being taken into consideration when designing conservation plans for future generations are anthropogenic barriers in the form of urban development and roads. These elements are acting as obstacles, causing fragmentation of the remaining grizzly bear population habitat and prevention of gene flow between subpopulations (for example, Banff National Park). This, in turn, is creating a decline in genetic diversity, and therefore the overall fitness of the general population is lowered.[138] In light of these issues, conservation plans often include migration corridors by way of long strips of \\"park forest\\" to connect less developed areas, or by way of tunnels and overpasses over busy roads.[139] Using GPS collar tracking, scientists can study whether or not these efforts are actually making a positive contribution towards resolving the problem.[140] To date, most corridors are found to be infrequently used, and thus genetic isolation is currently occurring, which can result in inbreeding and therefore an increased frequency of deleterious genes through genetic drift.[141] Current data suggest female grizzly bears are disproportionately less likely than males to use these corridors, which can prevent mate access and decrease the number of offspring.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, national efforts have been made since 1982 for the recovery plan of grizzly bears.[142] A lot of the efforts made have been through different organizations efforts to educate the public on grizzly bear safety, habits of grizzly bears and different ways to reduce human-bear conflict. The Interagency Grizzly Bear Recovery Committee is one of many organizations committed to the recovery of grizzly bears in the lower 48 states.[143] There are five recovery zones for grizzly bears in the lower 48 states including the North Cascades ecosystem in Washington state.[144] The National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife initiated the process of an environmental impact statement that started in the fall of 2014 to begin the recovery process of grizzly bears to the North Cascades region.[144] A final plan and environmental impact statement was released in the spring of 2017 with a record of decision to follow.[144][145]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early March 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to withdraw Endangered Species Act protections from grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park. The population has risen from 136 bears in 1975 to an estimated 700 in 2017, and was \\"delisted\\" in June 2017.[144][146][145]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past 20 years in Alaska, ecotourism has boomed. While many people come to Alaska to bear-hunt, the majority come to watch the bears and observe their habits. Some of the best bear viewing in the world occurs on coastal areas of the Alaska Peninsula, including in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Katmai National Park and Preserve, and the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary and Refuge. Here bears gather in large numbers to feast on concentrated food sources, including sedges in the salt marshes, clams in the nearby tidal flats, salmon in the estuary streams, and berries on the neighboring hillsides.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatmai National Park and Preserve is one of the best spots to view brown bears. The bear population in Katmai is estimated at a healthy 2,100.[147] The park is located on the Alaskan Peninsula about 480?km (300?mi) southwest of the city of Anchorage. At Brooks Camp, a famous site exists where grizzlies can be seen catching salmon from atop a platformyou can even view this online from a cam.[148] In coastal areas of the park, such as  Hallo Bay, Geographic Harbor, Swikshak Lagoon, American Creek, Big River, Kamishak River, Savonoski River, Moraine Creek, Funnel Creek, Battle Creek, Nantuk Creek,[149] Kukak Bay, and Kaflia Bay you can often watch bears fishing alongside wolves, eagles, and river otters. Coastal areas host the highest population densities year round because there is a larger variety of food sources available, but Brooks Camp hosts the highest population (100 bears).[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe McNeil River State Game Sanctuary and Refuge, on the McNeil River, is home to the greatest concentration of brown bears in the world. An estimated 144 individual bears have been identified at the falls in a single summer with as many as 74 at one time;[151] 60 or more bears at the falls is a frequent sight, and it is not uncommon to see 100 bears at the falls throughout a single day.[152] The McNeil River State Game Refuge, containing Chenik Lake and a smaller number of grizzly bears, has been closed to grizzly hunting since 1995.[153] All of the Katmai-McNeil area is closed to hunting except for Katmai National Preserve, where regulated legal hunting takes place.[154] In all, the Katmai-McNeil area has an estimated 2,500 grizzly bears.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiralty Island, in southeast Alaska, was known to early natives as Xootsnoow~, meaning \\"fortress of bears,\\" and is home to the densest grizzly population in North America. An estimated 1600 grizzlies live on the island, which itself is only 140?km (90?mi) long.[156] One place to view grizzly bears in the island is probably Pack Creek, in the Stan Price State Wildlife Sanctuary. 20 to 30 grizzlies can be observed at the creek at one time and like Brooks Camp, visitors can watch bears from an above platform.[157] Kodiak Island, hence its name, is another place to view bears. An estimated 3,500 Kodiak grizzly bears inhabit the island, 2,300 of these in the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge.[158][159] The O'Malley River is considered the best place on Kodiak Island to view grizzly bears.[160]","field3":"What state has the highest population of bears?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"4,195","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"","field3":"How many pages are in the harry potter series?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"cure headache, constipation, dyspepsia, and biliousness","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Carter's Little Liver Pills (Carter's Little Pills after 1959) were formulated as a patent medicine by Samuel J.

It is a 1.5-mile-long (2.4?km) horse race, open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds. Colts and geldings carry a weight of 126 pounds (57?kg); fillies carry 121 pounds (55?kg). The race, nicknamed The Test of the Champion, and The Run for the Carnations, is the third and final leg of the Triple Crown and is held five weeks after the Kentucky Derby and three weeks after the Preakness Stakes. The 1973 Belmont Stakes and Triple Crown winner Secretariat holds the mile and a half stakes record (which is also a track and world record on dirt) of 2:24.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attendance at the Belmont Stakes is among the American thoroughbred racing top-attended events. The 2004 Belmont Stakes drew a television audience of 21.9 million viewers, and had the highest household viewing rate since 1977 when Seattle Slew won the Triple Crown.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 150th Belmont Stakes took place on Saturday, June 9, 2018.  Justify won the race and became the second horse in four years to win the Triple Crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Belmont Stakes was held at Jerome Park Racetrack in The Bronx, built in 1866 by stock market speculator Leonard Jerome (1817ÿ1891) and financed by August Belmont Sr. (1816ÿ1890), for whom the race was named. The first race in 1867 saw the filly Ruthless win, while the following year was won by General Duke.[2] The race continued to be held at Jerome Park until 1890, when it was moved to the nearby facility, Morris Park Racecourse.[3] The 1895 race was almost not held because of new laws that banned bookmaking in New York: it was eventually rescheduled for November 2.[4] The race remained at Morris Park Racecourse until the May 1905 opening of the new Belmont Park, 430-acre (1.7?km2) racetrack in Elmont, New York on Long Island, just outside the New York City borough of Queens.[3] When anti-gambling legislation was passed in New York State, Belmont Racetrack was closed, and the race was cancelled in 1911 and 1912.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first winner of the Triple Crown was Sir Barton, in 1919, before the series was recognized as such.[6] In 1920, the Belmont was won by the great Man o' War, who won by 20 lengths, setting a new stakes and American record.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 1926, the winner of the Belmont Stakes has been presented with August Belmont Trophy. The owner may keep the trophy for one year, and also receives a silver miniature for permanent use.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term Triple Crown was first used when Gallant Fox won the three races in 1930, but the term did not enter widespread use until 1935 when his son Omaha repeated the feat. Sir Barton was then honored retroactively.[8] Since 1931, the order of Triple Crown races has been the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes, and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1931, the Preakness was run before the Derby eleven times. On May 12, 1917 and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day. On eleven occasions, the Belmont Stakes was run before the Preakness Stakes.[9] The date of each event is now set by the Kentucky Derby, which is always held on the first Saturday in May. The Preakness Stakes is currently held two weeks later; and the Belmont Stakes is held three weeks after the Preakness (five weeks after the Derby). The earliest possible date for the Derby is May 1, and the latest is May 7; the earliest possible date for the Belmont is thus June 5, and the latest is June 11.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937, War Admiral became the fourth Triple Crown winner after winning the Belmont in a new track record time of 2:28 3/5.[11] In the 1940s, four Triple Crown winners followed: Whirlaway in 1941, Count Fleet in 1943, Assault in 1946 and Citation in 1948. Count Fleet won the race by a then-record margin of twenty-five lengths.[12] He also set a stakes record of 2:28 1/5, a record tied by Citation. In 1957, the stakes record was smashed when Gallant Man ran the Belmont in 2:26 3/5 in a year when the Triple Crown series was split three ways.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belmont Stakes race was held at Aqueduct Racetrack from 1963 to 1967, while the track at Belmont was restored and renovated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest crowd of the 20th century was in 1971 with over 80,000 people, supplemented by the city's Latino community, there to cheer on their new hero, Ca?onero II, the Venezuelan colt who had won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and was poised to win the U.S. Triple Crown. However, due to a foot infection that had bothered the horse for several days, Ca?onero II failed to win the Triple Crown when he struggled across the finish line in 4th place behind Pass Catcher, ridden by Walter Blum. Despite this loss, Ca?onero II was named the winner of the first Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 9, 1973, Secretariat won the Belmont Stakes by thirty-one lengths in a record time of 2:24, becoming a Triple Crown champion, ending a 25-year gap between Citation, the Belmont and Triple Crown winner in 1948. Secretariat's record still stands as the fastest running of the Belmont Stakes and an American record for 1? miles on the dirt.[15] In 1977, Seattle Slew became the first horse to win the Triple Crown while undefeated. Affirmed was the last winner of the Triple Crown in the 20th century, taking the Belmont Stakes in 2:26 4/5 on June 10, 1978. Ridden by eighteen-year-old Steve Cauthen, Affirmed defeated rival Alydar with Jorge Velasquez in the saddle. At the time the race was the third-slowest start and the third-fastest finish with the quarter in 25, the half in 50, 3/4 in 1:14, the mile in 1:37 2/5.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, Secretariat's son Risen Star won the Belmont in 2:26 2/5, then the second-fastest time in the history of the race. The next year, Easy Goer lowered the mark for second-fastest time to 2:26. Easy Goer also holds a Beyer Speed Figure of 122 for the race, the best of any Triple Crown race since these ratings were first published in 1987.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor three years in a row, horses came to the Belmont Stakes with a Triple Crown on the line only to fail. In 2002, Belmont Park hosted what was then the largest crowd in its history when 103,222 saw War Emblem lose to longshot Sarava after stumbling at the start. In 2003, 101,864 watched Funny Cide finish third behind Empire Maker. In 2004, the attendance record was shattered when 120,139 people saw Smarty Jones upset by Birdstone.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, Rags to Riches became the first filly to win the race since Tanya in 1905. Three more failed Triple Crown bids followed: in 2008, Big Brown lost to Da' Tara; in 2012, I'll Have Another was withdrawn due to injury; and in 2014, California Chrome was beaten by Tonalist. This fueled debate about whether the series needed to be changed, for example by lengthening the period between races.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Pharoah won the 2015 race, becoming the 12th horse in history to win the Triple Crown and the first in 37 years. The crowd that year was limited for the first time, to 90,000.[20] His time of 2:26.65 was the sixth-fastest in Belmont Stakes history, and the second-fastest time for a Triple Crown winner.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belmont Stakes has been run at a mile and a half since 1926, having been run at that distance in 1874ÿ1889.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe race has also been run at the following distances: a mile and five furlongs in 1867ÿ1873; a mile and a quarter in 1890ÿ1892, 1895, and 1904ÿ1905; a mile and a furlong in 1893ÿ1894; and a mile and three furlongs from 1896ÿ1903 and 1906ÿ1925.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe purse for the first running in 1867 was $1,500 added,[22] meaning the purse was supplemented by nomination and entry fees. This made the total purse $2,500, with the winner receiving $1,850. The purse increased sharply in the Roaring Twenties, from Man O'War's earnings of $7,950 in 1920 to Gallant Fox's take of $66,040 in 1930. Purses declined as a result of the Great Depression, with War Admiral earning only $28,020 in 1937, then began to recover. Throughout the sixties and early seventies, the value to the winner was roughly $100,000, depending on the added money generated by entry fees (larger fields thus leading to higher prize money). The purse was repeatedly raised in the eighties and nineties, reaching $500,000 added, with the winner receiving roughly $400,000.[2] In 1998, the purse was changed to $1,000,000 guaranteed, with the winner receiving $600,000. In 2014, the purse was raised to $1,500,000.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith one exception, the race has been run at a level weight of 126 pounds (with a 5-pound allowance for fillies) since 1900. The 126 pounds comes from the English Classics, where the standard weight is 9 stone, with one stone equaling 14 pounds. In 1913, the Belmont was run as a handicap with the winner carrying only 109 pounds compared to the runner-up carrying 126 pounds. Races run prior to 1900 had varied weight conditions.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first post parade in the United States was at the 14th Belmont, in 1880. Before 1921, the race was run in the clockwise tradition of English racing. Since then, the race has been run in the American, or counter-clockwise, direction. Because of its length (one lap around the enormous Belmont main track), and because it is the final race of the Triple Crown, it is called the \\"Test of the Champion\\". Most three-year-olds are unaccustomed to the distance, and lack the experience, if not the stamina, to maintain a winning speed for so long. In a long race such as the Belmont, positioning of the horse and the timing of the move to chase for the lead can be critical.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belmont Stakes is traditionally called \\"The Test of the Champion\\" because of its 1.5 mile lengthby far the longest of the three Triple Crown races, and one of the longest for a first-class race in the United States on the dirt. It is also known as \\"The Run for the Carnations\\" because the winning horse is draped with a blanket of white carnations after the race, in similar fashion to the blanket of roses and black-eyed Susans for the Derby and Preakness, respectively. The winning owner is ceremonially presented with the silver winner's trophy, designed by Paulding Farnham for Tiffany and Co. It was first presented to August Belmont Jr. in 1896 and donated by the Belmont family for annual presentation in 1926.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the fact that the Belmont Stakes is the oldest of the Triple Crown races, its traditions have been more subject to change. Until 1996, the post parade song was \\"The Sidewalks of New York\\". From 1997 to 2009, the song was changed to broadcast a recording by Frank Sinatra of the \\"Theme from New York, New York\\" in an attempt to appeal to younger fans.[24] In 2010, the song was changed to Jay-Z's \\"Empire State of Mind\\"[25] before reverting to \\"Theme from New York, New York\\" from 2011[26] through the present. This tradition is similar to the singing of the state song at the post parades of the first two Triple Crown races: \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" at the Kentucky Derby and \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\" at the Preakness Stakes.[3] The change of song gave rise to \\"the myth of Mamie O'Rourke,\\" a reference to a character in the lyrics of \\"The Sidewalks of New York.\\" Before American Pharoah won the Triple Crown in 2015, some claimed that changing the official Belmont song \\"cursed\\" the Triple Crown and was why no horse had won since Affirmed in 1978. Others note that there was no Triple Crown winner between 1979 and 1996, even though \\"Sidewalks\\" was still played.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the change of song in 1997, the official drink was also changed, from the \\"White Carnation\\" to the \\"Belmont Breeze.\\"[28] The New York Times reviewed both cocktails unfavorably, calling the Belmont Breeze \\"a significant improvement over the nigh undrinkable White Carnation\\" despite the fact that it \\"tastes like a refined trashcan punch.\\"[29] In 2011, the Belmont Breeze was again changed to the current official drink known as the \\"Belmont Jewel.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the origin of the white carnation as the official flower of the Belmont Stakes is unknown, traditionally, pure white carnations stand for love and luck. It takes approximately 700 \\"select\\" carnations imported from Colombia to create the 40-pound blanket draped over the winner of the Belmont Stakes. The NYRA has long used The Pennock Company, a wholesale florist based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to import the carnations used for the mantle.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1986 until 2005, the Triple Crown television rights comprised a single package. In late 2004, the New York Racing Association withdrew from that agreement to negotiate independently.[31] As a result of this NBC, who was the rights holder for all three events, was only able to keep its broadcast rights to the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. ABC regained the rights to the Belmont Stakes as part of a five-year contract that expired following the 2010 race; NBC has since regained the rights to the race through 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeed record:[36][a]\\r\\n\\r\\nMargin of Victory:[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost wins by a jockey:[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost wins by a trainer:[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost wins by an owner:[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly 23 fillies have run in the Belmont; three of which have won:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis gives them a respectable 13% win rate when entered.[38] For context, three fillies have won the Kentucky Derby while five have won the Preakness Stakes. On average, fillies have won between 2% and 3% of the Triple Crown races, with similar numbers for geldings; while about 95% of these races have been won by colts.

In biological terms, this entails growth from a one-celled zygote to an adult human being.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFertilization occurs when the sperm successfully enters the ovum's membrane. The genetical material of the sperm and egg that combine to form a single cell, called a zygote, and the germinal stage of prenatal development commences.[1] The germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization, through the development of the early embryo, up until implantation. The germinal stage is over at about 10 days of gestation.[2]\\r\\nThe zygote contains a full complement of genetic material and develops into the embryo. Briefly, embryonic developments have four stages: the morula stage, the bastula stage, the gastrula stage, and the neurula stage. Prior to implantation, the embryo remains in a protein shell, the zona pellucida, and undergoes a series of cell divisions, called mitosis. A week after fertilization the embryo still has not grown in size, but hatches from the zona pellucida and adheres to the lining of the mother's uterus. This induces a decidual reaction, wherein the uterine cells proliferate and surround the embryo thus causing it to become embedded within the uterine tissue. The embryo, meanwhile, proliferates and develops both into embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue, the latter forming the fetal membranes and the placenta. In humans, the embryo is referred to as a fetus in the later stages of prenatal development. The transition from embryo to fetus is arbitrarily defined as occurring 8 weeks after fertilization. In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a set of progressively developing internal organs. A nearly identical process occurs in other species.\\r\\nThe following are some approximate age ranges for physical development stages:\\r\\nAlso sometimes used are terms that specify one's age in numbers, such as:\\r\\nThe Tanner stages can be used to approximately judge a child's age based on physical development.","field3":"What are the four stages of human development?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Waitangi","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"","field3":"Where was the treaty of waitangi first signed?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Death Valley's Badwater Basin","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Death Valley is a desert valley located in Eastern California, in the northern Mojave Desert bordering the Great Basin Desert. It is one of the hottest places in the world at the height of summertime along with deserts in Africa and in the Middle East.[3]\\r\\nDeath Valley's Badwater Basin is the point of the lowest elevation in North America, at 282 feet (86?m) below sea level.[1] This point is 84.6 miles (136.2?km) east-southeast of Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States with an elevation of 14,505 feet (4,421 m).[4] Death Valley's Furnace Creek holds the record for the highest reliably recorded air temperature On Earth at 134?F (56.7?C) on July 10, 1913, as well as the highest recorded natural ground surface temperature on Earth at 201?F (93.9?C) on July 15, 1917.[note 1][6][7]\\r\\nLocated near the border of California and Nevada, in the Great Basin, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains, Death Valley constitutes much of Death Valley National Park and is the principal feature of the Mojave and Colorado Deserts Biosphere Reserve. It is located mostly in Inyo County, California. It runs from north to south between the Amargosa Range on the east and the Panamint Range on the west; the Grapevine Mountains and the Owlshead Mountains form its northern and southern boundaries, respectively.[8] It has an area of about 3,000?sq?mi (7,800?km2).[9] The highest point in Death Valley itself is Telescope Peak in the Panamint Range, which has an elevation of 11,043 feet (3,366?m).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath Valley is an excellent example of a graben, or a downdropped block of land between two mountain ranges.[11] It lies at the southern end of a geological trough known as Walker Lane, which runs north to Oregon. The valley is bisected by a right lateral strike slip fault system, represented by the Death Valley Fault and the Furnace Creek Fault. The eastern end of the left lateral Garlock Fault intersects the Death Valley Fault. Furnace Creek and the Amargosa River flow through the valley but eventually disappear into the sands of the valley floor.\\r\\nDeath Valley also contains salt pans. According to current geological consensus, at various times during the middle of the Pleistocene era, which ended roughly 10,000ÿ12,000 years ago, an inland lake referred to as Lake Manly formed in Death Valley. Lake Manly was nearly 100 miles (160?km) long and 600 feet (180?m) deep, the end-basin in a chain of lakes that began with Mono Lake in the north and continued through multiple basins down the Owens River Valley through Searles and China Lakes and the Panamint Valley to the immediate west.[12]\\r\\nAs the area turned to desert, the water evaporated, leaving the abundance of evaporitic salts such as common sodium salts and borax, which were later exploited during the modern history of the region, primarily 1883 to 1907.[13]\\r\\nDeath Valley has a subtropical, hot desert climate (K?ppen: BWh), with long, extremely hot summers and short, mild winters, as well as little rainfall. As a general rule, lower altitudes tend to have higher temperatures. When the sun heats the ground, that heat is then radiated upward, but the dense below-sea-level air absorbs some of this radiation and radiates some of it back towards the ground. In addition, the high valley walls trap rising hot air and recycle it back down to the valley floor, where it is heated by compression.[14]\\r\\nThis process is especially important in Death Valley, as it provides its specific climate and geography. The valley is surrounded by mountains, while its surface is mostly flat and devoid of plants, so much of the sun's heat can reach the ground, absorbed by soil and rock. When air at ground level is heated, it begins to rise, moving up past steep, high mountain ranges, which then cools slightly, sinking back down towards the valley more compressed. This air is then reheated by the sun to a higher temperature, moving up the mountain again, whereby the air moves up and down in a circular motion in cycles, similar to how a convection oven works. This heated air increases ground temperature markedly, forming the hot wind currents that are trapped by atmospheric pressure and mountains, thus stays mostly within the valley. Such hot wind currents contribute to perpetual drought-like conditions in Death Valley and prevent much cloud formation from passing through the confines of the valley, where precipitation is often in the form of a virga.[15] Death Valley holds temperature records because it has an unusually high number of factors that lead to high atmospheric temperatures.\\r\\nThe depth and shape of Death Valley influence its summer temperatures. The valley is a long, narrow basin 282 feet (86?m) below sea level, yet is walled by high, steep mountain ranges. The clear, dry air and sparse plant cover allow sunlight to heat the desert surface. Summer nights provide little relief, as overnight lows may only dip into the 82 to 98?F (28 to 37?C) range. Moving masses of super-heated air blow through the valley creating extremely high temperatures.[16]\\r\\nThe hottest air temperature ever recorded in Death Valley was 134?F (56.7?C) on July 10, 1913, at Furnace Creek,[17] which is the hottest atmospheric temperature ever recorded on earth.[6] During the heat wave that peaked with that record, five consecutive days reached 129?F (54?C) or above. Some meteorologists dispute the accuracy of the 1913 temperature measurement.[18]\\r\\nThe hottest surface temperature ever recorded in Death Valley was 201.0?F (93.9?C) on July 15, 1972, at Furnace Creek, which is the hottest ground surface temperature ever recorded on earth, as well as the only recorded surface temperature of above 200?F (93.3?C).[19]\\r\\nThe greatest number of consecutive days with a maximum temperature of 100?F (38?C) or above was 154 days in the summer of 2001. The summer of 1996 had 40 days over 120?F (49?C), and 105 days over 110?F (43?C). The summer of 1917 had 52 days where the temperature reached 120?F (49?C) or above with 43 of them consecutive. Four major mountain ranges lie between Death Valley and the ocean, each one adding to an increasingly drier rain shadow effect, and in 1929, 1953, and 1989, no rain was recorded for the whole year.[16] The period from 1931 to 1934 was the driest stretch on record with only 0.64 inches (16?mm) of rain over a 40-month period.[15] On June 30, 2013, during the 2013 extreme heat wave, the mercury reached 129?F (54?C) at Furnace Creek station, which is the all-time hottest air temperature recorded for June.\\r\\nThe mean annual temperature for Death Valley (Furnace Creek Weather Station) is 77.2?F (25.1?C) with an average high of 65.2?F (18?C) in December, 66.9?F (19?C) in January, and 116.5?F (47?C) in July.[20] From 1934 to 1961, the weather station at Cow Creek recorded a mean annual temperature of 77.2?F (25.1?C).[21]\\r\\nThe longest number of consecutive days where temperatures reached 90?F (32?C) or more was 205 from April to October 1992.[22] On average, 192 days per year in Death Valley have temperatures that reach 90?F or more.[23] Before being moved to Furnace Creek, the weather station at Greenland Ranch averaged 194.4 days annually where temperatures reached 90?F or more.[24]\\r\\nThe lowest temperature recorded at Greenland Ranch was 15?F (?9?C) in January 1913.[25]\\r\\nThe period from July 17ÿ19, 1959, was the longest string of consecutive days where nighttime low temperatures did not drop below 100?F (38?C).[26] The highest overnight or low temperature recorded in Death Valley is 110?F (43?C), recorded on July 5, 1918, and the current world record for hottest overnight low.[27] As recently as July 12, 2012, the low temperature at Death Valley dropped to just 107?F (42?C) after a high of 128?F (53?C) on the previous day. The only other location which matches Death Valley's overnight low temperature of 107?F in recent years is Khasab Airport in Oman, which also recorded a low of 107?F (42?C) on June 27, 2012.[28] Also on July 12, 2012 the mean 24-hour temperature recorded at Death Valley was 117.5?F (47.5?C), which makes it the world's warmest 24-hour temperature on record.[29]\\r\\nThe average annual precipitation in Death Valley is 2.36 inches (60?mm), while the Greenland Ranch station averaged 1.58?in (40?mm).[30] The wettest month on record is January 1995, when 2.59 inches (66?mm) fell on Death Valley.[15] The wettest period on record was mid-2004 to mid-2005, in which nearly 6 inches (150?mm) of rain fell in total, leading to ephemeral lakes in the valley and the region and tremendous wildflower blooms.[31] Snow with accumulation has only been recorded in January 1922, while scattered flakes have been recorded on other occasions.\\r\\nIn 2005, Death Valley received four times its average annual rainfall of 1.5 inches (38?mm). As it has done before for hundreds of years, the lowest spot in the valley filled with a wide, shallow lake, but the extreme heat and aridity immediately began evaporating the ephemeral lake.\\r\\nThe pair of images (seen at right) from NASA's Landsat 5 satellite documents the short history of Death Valley's Lake Badwater: formed in February 2005 (top) and evaporated by February 2007 (bottom). In 2005, a big pool of greenish water stretched most of the way across the valley floor. By May 2005 the valley floor had resumed its more familiar role as Badwater Basin, a salt-coated salt flats. In time, this freshly dissolved and recrystallized salt will darken.\\r\\nThe western margin of Death Valley is traced by alluvial fans. During flash floods, rainfall from the steep mountains to the west pours through narrow canyons, picking up everything from fine clay to large rocks. When these torrents reach the mouths of the canyons, they widen and slow, branching out into braided streams. The paler the fans, the younger they are.\\r\\nIn spite of the overwhelming heat and sparse rainfall, Death Valley exhibits considerable biodiversity. Wildflowers, watered by snowmelt, carpet the desert floor each spring, continuing into June.[31] Bighorn sheep, red-tailed hawks, and wild burros may be seen. Death Valley has over 600 springs and ponds. Salt Creek, a mile-long shallow depression in the center of the valley, supports pupfish.[35] These isolated pupfish populations are remnants of the wetter Pleistocene climate.[35]\\r\\nDarwin Falls, on the western edge of Death Valley Monument, falls 100 feet (30?m) into a large pond surrounded by willows and cottonwood trees. Over 80 species of birds have been spotted around the pond.[36]\\r\\nDeath Valley is home to the Timbisha tribe of Native Americans, formerly known as the Panamint Shoshone, who have inhabited the valley for at least the past millennium. The Timbisha name for the valley, tmpisa, means \\"rock paint\\" and refers to the red ochre paint that can be made from a type of clay found in the valley. Some families still live in the valley at Furnace Creek. Another village was in Grapevine Canyon near the present site of Scotty's Castle. It was called in the Timbisha language maahunu, whose meaning is uncertain, although it is known that hunu means \\"canyon\\".\\r\\nThe valley received its English name in 1849 during the California Gold Rush. It was called Death Valley by prospectors[37] and others who sought to cross the valley on their way to the gold fields, after 13 pioneers perished from one early expedition of wagon trains.[38][39] During the 1850s, gold and silver were extracted in the valley. In the 1880s, borax was discovered and extracted by mule-drawn wagons.\\r\\nOn the afternoon of July 10, 1913, the United States Weather Bureau recorded a high temperature of 134?F (56.7?C) at Greenland Ranch (now Furnace Creek) in Death Valley.[6] This temperature stands as the highest ambient air temperature ever recorded at the surface of the Earth. (A report of a temperature of 58?C (136.4?F) recorded in Libya in 1922 was later determined to be inaccurate.)[17]\\r\\nDeath Valley National Monument was proclaimed on February 11, 1933, by President Herbert Hoover, placing the area under federal protection. In 1994, the monument was redesignated as Death Valley National Park, as well as being substantially expanded to include Saline and Eureka Valleys.\\r\\nA number of movies have been filmed in Death Valley, such as:[40]","field3":"What is the lowest place in north america?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"\\"Theme One\\", specially composed for the launch by George Martin","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"HTTP Streams\\r\\nHLS Streams\\r\\nMPEG DASH Streams\\r\\nBBC Radio 1 is a British radio station operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation which also broadcasts internationally, specialising in modern and current popular music and chart hits throughout the day. Radio 1 provides alternative genres after 7?pm, including electronic dance, hip hop, rock, indie or interviews. It was launched in 1967 to meet the demand for music generated by pirate radio stations, when the average age of the UK population was 27.[3] Recently, the BBC claimed that it still targets the 15ÿ29 age group,[4] although the average age of its UK audience in 2008 had risen to 33.[5] BBC Radio 1 started 24-hour broadcasting on 1 May 1991.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio 1 was established in 1967 (along with the more middle of the road BBC Radio 2) as a successor to the BBC Light Programme, which had broadcast popular music and other entertainment since 1945. Radio 1 was conceived as a direct response to the popularity of offshore pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline and Radio London, which had been outlawed by Act of Parliament.[7] Radio 1 was launched at 6:55?am on Saturday 30 September 1967.\\r\\nBroadcasts were on 247 metres (1215 kHz) medium wave, using a network of transmitters which had carried the Light Programme.[8] Most were of comparatively low power, at less than 50 kilowatts, leading to patchy coverage of the country.\\r\\nThe first disc jockey to broadcast on the new station was Tony Blackburn, whose cheery style, first heard on Radio Caroline and Radio London, won him the prime slot on what became known as the \\"Radio 1 Breakfast Show\\". The first words on Radio 1 ÿ after a countdown by the Controller of Radios 1 and 2, Robin Scott, and a jingle, recorded at PAMS in Dallas, Texas, beginning \\"The voice of Radio 1\\" ÿ were:[citation needed]\\r\\nAnd, good morning everyone. Welcome to the exciting new sound of Radio 1.\\r\\nThis was the first use of US-style jingles on BBC radio, but the style was familiar to listeners who were acquainted with Blackburn and other DJs from their days on pirate radio. The reason jingles from PAMS were used was that the Musicians' Union would not agree to a single fee for the singers and musicians if the jingles were made \\"in-house\\" by the BBC; they wanted repeat fees each time one was played.\\r\\nThe first music to be heard on the station was \\"Theme One\\", specially composed for the launch by George Martin. It was followed by an extract from \\"Beefeaters\\" by Johnny Dankworth.[9] The first complete record played on Radio 1 was \\"Flowers in the Rain\\" by The Move. The second single was \\"Massachusetts\\" by The Bee Gees. The breakfast show remains the most prized slot in the Radio 1 schedule, with every change of breakfast show presenter exciting considerable media interest.[10]\\r\\nThe initial rota of staff included John Peel and a gaggle of others, some transferred from pirate stations, such as Keith Skues, Ed Stewart, Mike Raven, David Ryder, Jim Fisher, Jimmy Young, Dave Cash, Kenny Everett, Simon Dee, Terry Wogan, Duncan Johnson, Doug Crawford, Tommy Vance, Chris Denning, Emperor Rosko, Pete Murray, and Bob Holness. Many of the most popular pirate radio voices, such as Simon Dee, had only a one-hour slot per week (\\"Midday Spin.\\")[11]\\r\\nInitially, the station was unpopular with some of its target audience who, it is claimed, disliked the fact that much of its airtime was shared with Radio 2 and that it was less unequivocally aimed at a young audience than the offshore stations, with some DJs such as Jimmy Young being in their 40s. The very fact that it was part of an \\"establishment\\" institution such as the BBC was a turn-off for some, and needle time restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had. It also had limited finances (partly because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station) and often, as in January 1975, suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks, strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives.\\r\\nDespite this, it gained massive audiences, becoming the most listened-to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows (up to 20 million for some of the combined Radio 1 and Radio 2 shows). In the early-mid-1970s Radio 1 presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids, thanks to the Publicity Department's high-profile work. The touring summer live broadcasts called the Radio 1 Roadshow ÿ usually as part of the BBC 'Radio Weeks' promotions that took Radio 1, 2 and 4 shows on the road ÿ drew some of the largest crowds of the decade. The station undoubtedly played a role in maintaining the high sales of 45 rpm single records although it benefited from a lack of competition, apart from Radio Luxembourg and Manx Radio in the Isle of Man. (Independent Local Radio did not begin until October 1973 and took many years to cover virtually all of the UK). Alan Freeman's 'Saturday Rock Show' was voted 'Best Radio Show' five years running by readers of a national music publication, and was then axed by controller Derek Chinnery.\\r\\nAnnie Nightingale, who joined in 1970, was Britain's first female DJ and is now the longest serving presenter, having constantly evolved her musical tastes with the times.[13]\\r\\nOn Thursday 23 November 1978 the station moved to two new medium wave frequencies (275m and 285m) which allowed a major increase in transmitter powers and improved coverage of the UK. 247 metres was passed to Radio 3. The station was on medium wave only until the early 80s, when it took over the Radio 2 FM frequency for a number of hours on weekend afternoons and late weekday evenings. Eventually the BBC set up an FM channel specifically for Radio 1 and after a number of years of parallel broadcasting, relinquished the medium wave frequencies.\\r\\nIn his last few months as controller, Johnny Beerling commissioned a handful of new shows that in some ways set the tone for what was to come under Matthew Bannister. One of these \\"Loud'n'proud\\" was the UK's first national radio series aimed at a gay audience (made in Manchester and was aired from August 1993). Far from being a parting quirk, the show was a surprise hit and led to the network's first coverage of the large outdoor Gay Pride event in 1994. Bannister took the reins fully in October 1993. His aim was to rid the station of its 'Smashie and Nicey' image and make it appeal to the under 25s. Although originally launched as a youth station, by the early 1990s, its loyal listeners (and DJs) had aged with the station over its 25-year history. Many long-standing DJs, such as Simon Bates, Dave Lee Travis, Alan Freeman, Bob Harris, Gary Davies, and later Steve Wright, Bruno Brookes and Johnnie Walker left the station or were sacked, and in January 1995 old music (typically anything recorded before 1990) was banned from the daytime playlist.\\r\\nMany listeners rebelled as the first new DJs to be introduced represented a crossover from other parts of the BBC (notably Bannister and Trevor Dann's former colleagues at the BBC's London station, GLR) with Emma Freud and Danny Baker. Another problem was that, at the time, Radio 2 was sticking resolutely to a format which appealed mainly to those who had been listening since the days of the Light Programme, and commercial radio, which was targeting the \\"Radio 1 and a half\\" audience, consequently enjoyed a massive increase in its audience share at the expense of Radio 1.\\r\\nAfter the departure of Steve Wright, who had been unsuccessfully moved from his long-running afternoon show to the breakfast show in January 1994, Bannister hired Chris Evans to present the prime morning slot in April 1995. Evans was a popular but controversial presenter who was eventually sacked in 1997 after he demanded to present the breakfast show for only four days per week. Evans was replaced from 17 February 1997 by Mark and Lard ÿ Mark Radcliffe (along with his sidekick Marc Riley), who found the slick, mass-audience style required for a breakfast show did not come naturally to them. They were replaced by Zo? Ball and Kevin Greening eight months later in October 1997, with Greening moving on and leaving Ball as solo presenter. The reinvention of the station happened at a fortuitous time, with the rise of Britpop in the mid-90s ÿ bands like Oasis, Blur and Pulp were popular and credible at the time and the station's popularity rose with them. Documentaries like John Peel's \\"Lost in Music\\" which looked at the influence that the use of drugs have had over popular musicians received critical acclaim but were slated inside Broadcasting House.\\r\\nLater in the 1990s the Britpop boom declined, and manufactured chart pop (boy bands and acts aimed at sub-teenagers) came to dominate the charts. New-genre music occupied the evenings (indie on weekdays and dance at weekends), with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights. The rise of rave culture through the late 1980s and early 1990s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ Pete Tong amongst others. There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show. This quickly gave birth to the Essential Mix where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two-hour slot. Dance music has been a permanent feature on Radio 1 since with club DJs such as Judge Jules, Danny Rampling and Seb Fontaine all having shows as well as Radio 1 hosting an annual weekend in Ibiza.\\r\\nListening numbers continued to decline but the station succeeded in targeting a younger age-group and more cross gender groups. Eventually, this change in content was reflected by a rise in audience that is continuing to this day. Notably, the station has received praise for shows such as The Surgery with Aled, Bobby Friction and Nihal, The Evening Session with Steve Lamacq and its successor Zane Lowe. Its website has also been well received. However, the breakfast show and the UK Top 40 continued to struggle. In 2000, Zo? Ball was replaced in the mornings by friend and fellow ladette Sara Cox, but, despite heavy promotion, listening figures for the breakfast show continued to fall. In 2004 Cox was replaced by Chris Moyles. The newly rebranded breakfast show was known as The Chris Moyles Show and it increased its audience, ahead of The Today Programme on Radio 4 as the second most popular breakfast show (after The Chris Evans Breakfast Show hosted by Chris Evans). Moyles continued to use innovative ways to try to tempt listeners from the 'Wake up with Wogan' show; in 2006, for example, creating a 'SAY NO TO WOGAN' campaign live on-air. This angered the BBC hierarchy, though the row simmered down when it was clear that the 'campaign' had totally failed to alter the listening trends of the time ÿ Wogan still increased figures at a faster rate than Moyles. The chart show's ratings fell after the departure of long-time host Mark Goodier, amid falling single sales in the UK. Ratings for the show fell in 2002 whilst Goodier was still presenting the show, meaning that commercial radio's Network Chart overtook it in the ratings for the first time. However, the BBC denied he was being sacked. Before July 2015, when the chart release day was changed to Friday, the BBC show competed with networked commercial radio's The Big Top 40 Show which was broadcast at the same time.\\r\\nMany DJs either ousted by Bannister or who left during his tenure (such as Johnnie Walker, Bob Harris and Steve Wright) have joined Radio 2 which has now overtaken Radio 1 as the UK's most popular radio station, using a style that Radio 1 had until the early 1990s. The success of Moyles' show has come alongside increased success for the station in general. In 2006, DJs Chris Moyles, Scott Mills and Zane Lowe all won gold Sony Radio Awards, while the station itself came away with the best station award. A new evening schedule was introduced in September 2006, dividing the week by genre. Monday was mainly pop-funkrock-oriented, Tuesday was R&B and hip-hop, Thursdays and Fridays were primarily dance, with specialist R&B and reggae shows. Following the death of John Peel in October 2004, Annie Nightingale is now the longest serving presenter, having worked there since 1970.\\r\\nThe licence-fee funding of Radio 1, alongside Radio 2, is often criticised by the commercial sector. In the first quarter of 2011 Radio 1 was part of an efficiency review conducted by John Myers.[14] His role, according to Andrew Harrison, the chief executive of RadioCentre, was \\"to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings.\\"[14]\\r\\nThe controller of Radio 1 and sister station 1Xtra changed to Ben Cooper on 28 October 2011, following the departure of Andy Parfitt. Ben Cooper answers to the Director of BBC Audio and Music, Tim Davie.[15]\\r\\nOn 7 December 2011, Ben Cooper's first major changes to the station were announced. Skream & Benga, Toddla T, Charlie Sloth and Friction replaced Judge Jules, Gilles Peterson, Kissy Sell Out and Fabio & Grooverider. A number of shows were shuffled to incorporate the new line-up.[16] On 28 February 2012, further changes were announced. Greg James and Scott Mills swapped shows and Jameela Jamil, Gemma Cairney and Danny Howard joined the station. The new line-up of DJs for In New DJs We Trust was also announced with B.Traits, Mosca, Jordan Suckley and Julio Bashmore hosting shows on a four weekly rotation.[17] This new schedule took effect on Monday, 2 April 2012.\\r\\nIn September 2012, Nick Grimshaw replaced Chris Moyles as host of \\"Radio 1's Breakfast Show\\". Grimshaw previously hosted Mon-Thurs 10pm-Midnight, Weekend Breakfast and Sunday evenings alongside Annie Mac. Grimshaw was replaced by Phil Taggart and Alice Levine on the 10pm-Midnight show.\\r\\nIn November 2012, another series of changes were announced. This included the departure of Reggie Yates and Vernon Kay. Jameela Jamil was announced as the new presenter of The Official Chart. Matt Edmondson moved to weekend mornings with Tom Deacon briefly replacing him on Wednesday nights. Dan Howell and Phil Lester, famous YouTubers and video bloggers, joined the station. The changes took effect in January 2013.[18]\\r\\nFormer breakfast presenter Sara Cox hosted her last show on Radio 1 in February 2014 before moving to Radio 2. In March 2014, Gemma Cairney left the weekend breakfast show to host the weekday early breakfast slot, swapping shows with Dev.\\r\\nIn September 2014, Radio 1 operated a series of changes to their output which saw many notable presenters leave the station ÿ including Edith Bowman, Nihal and Rob da Bank. Huw Stephens gained a new show hosting 10?pm?ÿ 1?am MondayÿWednesday with Alice Levine presenting weekends 1?pm?ÿ 4?pm. Radio 1's Residency also expanded with Skream joining the rotational line-up on Thursday nights (10?pm?ÿ 1?am).\\r\\nFrom December 2014 to April 2016, Radio 1 included a weekly late night show presented by a well known Internet personality called The Internet Takeover. Shows have been presented by various YouTubers such as Jim Chapman and Hannah Witton.[19]\\r\\nIn January 2015, Clara Amfo replaced Jameela Jamil as host of The Official Chart on Sundays (4?pm?ÿ 7?pm) and in March, Zane Lowe left Radio 1 and was replaced by Annie Mac on the new music evening show.\\r\\nIn May 2015, Fearne Cotton left the station after almost 10 years. Her weekday morning show was taken over by Clara Amfo. Adele Roberts also joined the weekday schedule line-up, hosting the Early Breakfast show.\\r\\nIn July 2015, The Official Chart moved to a Friday from 4?pm to 5:45?pm, hosted by Greg James. The move took place in order to take into account the changes to the release dates of music globally. Cel Spellman joined Radio 1 to host Sunday evenings (4?pm?ÿ 7?pm).\\r\\nFrom inception for over 20 years, Radio 1 broadcast from an adjacent pair of continuity suites (originally Con A and Con B) in the main control room of Broadcasting House. These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges (called self-op). This was a departure from traditional BBC practice, where a studio manager would play in discs from the studio control cubicle. Due to needle time restrictions, much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings. The DJs were assisted by one or more technical operators (TOs) who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts.\\r\\nIn 1985, Radio 1 moved across the road from Broadcasting House to Egton House. The station moved to Yalding House in 1996, and Egton House was demolished in 2003 to make way for extension to Broadcasting House. This extension would eventually be renamed the Egton Wing, and then the Peel Wing.\\r\\nUntil recently, the studios were located in the basement of Yalding House (near to BBC Broadcasting House) which is on Great Portland Street in central London. They used to broadcast from two main studios in the basement; Y2 and Y3 (there is also a smaller studio, YP1, used mainly for production). These two main studios (Y2 and Y3) are separated by the \\"Live Lounge\\", although it is mainly used as an office; there are rarely live sets recorded from it, as Maida Vale Studios is used instead for larger set-ups. The studios are linked by webcams and windows through the \\"Live Lounge\\", allowing DJs to see each other when changing between shows. Y2 is the studio from where The Chris Moyles Show was broadcast and is also the studio rigged with static cameras for when the station broadcasts on the \\"Live Cam\\". The station moved there in 1996 from Egton House.\\r\\nIn December 2012, Radio 1 moved from Yalding House to new studios on the 8th floor of the new BBC Broadcasting House, Portland Place, just a few metres away from the \\"Peel Wing\\", formerly the \\"Egton Wing\\", which occupies the land on which Egton House previously stood: it was renamed the \\"Peel Wing\\" in 2012 in honour of the long-serving BBC Radio 1 presenter, John Peel, who broadcast on the station from its launch in 1967 up until his death in 2004.\\r\\nProgrammes have also regularly been broadcast from other regions, notably The Mark and Lard Show, broadcast every weekday from New Broadcasting House, Oxford Road, Manchester for over a decade (October 1993 ÿ March 2004)  the longest regular broadcast on the network from outside the capital.\\r\\nRadio 1 originally broadcast on 1214?kHz medium wave (or 247 metres). On 23 November 1978, the station was moved to 1053 and 1089?kHz (275 and 285 m), but did not broadcast nationally on its own FM frequencies until late 1987. The BBC had been allocated three FM frequency ranges in 1955, for the then Light Programme (now BBC Radio 2), Third Programme (now BBC Radio 3) and Home Service (now BBC Radio 4) stations. Thus when Radio 1 was launched, there was no FM frequency range allocated for the station, the official reason being that there was no space, even though no commercial stations had yet launched on FM. Because of this, from launch until the end of the 1980s Radio 1 was allowed to take over Radio 2's FM transmitters for a few hours per week. These were Saturday afternoons, Sunday teatime and evening ÿ most notably for the Top 40 Singles Chart on Sunday afternoons; 10?pm to midnight on weeknights including Sounds of the Seventies until 1975, and thereafter the John Peel show (MonÿThurs) and the Friday Rock Show; and most Bank Holiday afternoons, when Radio 2 was broadcasting a Bank Holiday edition of Sport on 2.\\r\\nTo coincide with Radio 1's 20th birthday, the first full-time FM broadcast began in the London area on 31 October 1987, at low power on 104.8?MHz.[20] A year later the FM frequencies became national after the police communication allocation changed, freeing up what is known today as 97ÿ99 FM, which the BBC acquired. The rollout of Radio 1 on FM began on 1 September 1988, starting with Central Scotland, the Midlands and the north of England. A month later, to coincide with an extension of broadcast hours, Radio 1 stopped broadcasting on Radio 2's FM frequencies on weeknights and on Sunday evenings and by 1990 all usage of Radio 2's FM frequencies had ended. Radio 1 made great efforts to promote its new FM service, renaming itself on-air initially to 'Radio 1 FM' and later as '1FM' until 1995. The engineering programme was initially completed in 1995.\\r\\nThe Conservative government decided to increase competition on AM and disallowed the simulcasting of services on both AM and FM, affecting both BBC and Independent Local Radio. Radio 1's medium wave frequencies were reallocated to Independent National Radio. Radio 1's last broadcast on MW was on 1 July 1994, with Stephen Duffy's \\"Kiss Me\\" being the last record played on MW just before 9?am. For those who continued to listen, just after 9?am, Radio 1 jingles were played in reverse chronological order ending with its first jingle from 30 September 1967. In the initial months after this closure a pre-recorded message with Mark Goodier was played to warn listeners that Radio 1 was now an \\"FM-only\\" station.[21] Around this time, Radio 1 began broadcasting on spare audio subcarriers on Sky Television's analogue satellite service, initially in mono (on UK Gold) and later in stereo (on UK Living).\\r\\nThe BBC launched its national radio stations on DAB digital radio in 1995, however the technology was expensive at the time and so was not marketed, instead used as a test for future technologies. DAB was \\"officially\\" launched in 2002 as sets became cheaper. Today it can also be heard on UK digital TV services Freeview, Virgin Media, Sky and the Internet as well as FM. In July 2005, Sirius Satellite Radio began simulcasting Radio 1 across the United States as channel 11 on its own service and channel 6011 on Dish Network satellite TV. Sirius Canada began simulcasting Radio 1 when it was launched on 1 December 2005 (also on channel 11). The Sirius simulcasts were time shifted five hours to allow US and Canadian listeners in the Eastern Time Zone to hear Radio 1 at the same time of day as UK listeners. On 12 November 2008, Radio 1 made its debut on XM Satellite Radio in both the US and Canada on channel 29,[citation needed] moving to XM 15 and Sirius 15 on 4 May 2011.[22][23] Until the full station was removed in August 2011, Radio 1 was able to be heard by approximately 20.6 million listeners in North America on satellite radio alone. BBC Radio 1 can be heard on cable in the Netherlands at 105.10 FM.\\r\\nAt midnight on 9 August 2011, Sirius XM ceased carrying BBC Radio 1 programming with no prior warning. On 10 August 2011 the BBC issued the following statement:\\r\\nThe BBCs commercial arm BBC Worldwide has been in partnership with SIRIUS Satellite Radio to broadcast Radio 1 on their main network, since 2005. This agreement has now unfortunately come to an end and BBC Worldwide are in current discussions with the satellite radio station to find ways to continue to bring popular music channel, BBC Radio 1, to the US audience. We will keep you posted.[24]\\r\\nThousands of angry Sirius XM customers began a campaign on Facebook and other social media to reinstate BBC Radio 1 on Sirius XM Radio.[25] One week later, Sirius and the BBC agreed on a new carriage agreement[26] that saw Radio 1 broadcast on a time-shifted format on the Sirius XM Internet Radio platform only, on channel 815. The channel is still unavailable on the satellite platform of the service.\\r\\nStarting on 15 January 2012, The Official Chart Show began broadcasting on SiriusXM 20on20 channel 3, at 4?pm and 9?pm Eastern Standard Time.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn 19 August 2014, SiriusXM again stopped carrying BBC Radio 1 programming with no advanced notice. The stream is no longer available on the Internet Radio platform.\\r\\nFrom 1999 until 2012, Radio 1 split the home nations for localised programming in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to allow the broadcast of a showcase programme for regional talent. Most recently, these shows were under the BBC Introducing brand. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had their own shows, which were broadcast on a 3-week rotational basis in England.\\r\\nFrom January 2011 until June 2012, Scotland's show was presented by Ally McCrae.[27] Previously it was hosted by Vic Galloway (who also presents for BBC Radio Scotland); who had presented the show solo since 2004, after his original co-host Gill Mills departed.\\r\\nWales's show was hosted by Jen Long between January 2011 until May 2012.[28] Previously Bethan Elfyn occupied the slot, who had at one time hosted alongside Huw Stephens,[29] until Stephens left to join the national network, although he still broadcasts a show for Wales - a Welsh-language music show on BBC Radio Cymru on Thursday evenings)\\r\\nPhil Taggart presented the Northern Ireland programme between November 2011 and May 2012. The show was formerly presented by Rory McConnell. Before joining the national network, Colin Murray was a presenter on the Session in Northern Ireland, along with Donna Legge;[29][30] after Murray's promotion to the network Legge hosted alone for a time, and on her departure McConnell took her place.\\r\\nThe regional opt-outs originally went out from 8?pm to 10?pm on Thursdays (the Evening Session's time slot) and were known as the Session in the Nations (the 'Session' tag was later dropped due to the demise of the Evening Session); they later moved to run from 7:30?pm to 9?pm, with the first half-hour of Zane Lowe's programme going out across the whole of the UK. On 18 October 2007 the regional programmes moved to a Wednesday night/Thursday morning slot from midnight to 2?am under the BBC Introducing banner, allowing Lowe's Thursday show to be aired across the network; prior to this change Huw Stephens had presented the Wednesday midnight show nationally. In January 2011, BBC Introducing was moved to the new time slot of midnight to 2?am on Monday mornings, and the Scottish and Welsh shows were given new presenters in the form of Ally McCrae and Jen Long.\\r\\nThe opt-outs were only available to listeners on the FM frequencies. Because of the way the DAB and digital TV services of Radio 1 are broadcast (a single-frequency network on DAB and a single broadcast feed of Radio 1 on TV platforms), the digital version of the station was not regionalised.\\r\\nThe BBC Trust announced in May 2012 that the regional music programmes on Radio 1 would be replaced with a single programme offering a UK-wide platform for new music as part of a series of cost-cutting measures across the BBC.[31] In June 2012, the regional shows ended and were replaced by a single BBC Introducing show presented by Jen Long and Ally McCrae.[32]\\r\\nBecause of its youth-orientated nature, Radio 1 plays a mix of current songs, including independent/alternative, rap, hip hop, rock, house, electronica, dance, drum and bass, dubstep and pop.\\r\\nDue to restrictions on the amount of commercial music that could be played on radio in the UK until 1988 (the \\"needle time\\" limitation) the station has recorded many live performances. Studio sessions (recordings of about four tracks made in a single day), also supplemented the live music content, many them finding their way to commercially available LPs and CDs. The sessions recorded for John Peel's late night programme are particularly renowned.\\r\\nThe station also broadcasts documentaries and interviews. Although this type of programming arose from necessity it has given the station diversity. The needletime restrictions meant the station tended to have a higher level of speech by DJs. While the station is often criticised for \\"waffling\\" by presenters, an experimental \\"more music day\\" in 1988 was declared a failure after only a third of callers favoured it.\\r\\nRadio 1 has a public service broadcasting obligation to provide news, which it fulfills through Newsbeat bulletins throughout the day. Shared with 1Xtra, short news summaries are provided roughly hourly on the half-hour during daytime hours with two 15-minute bulletins at 12:45?pm and 5:45?pm on weekdays. The main presenter is Chris Smith, with Tina Daheley presenting during Radio 1's breakfast hours.\\r\\nIn recent years, Radio 1 has aimed to include more of its content online in order to relate to the changing nature of its audience. Its YouTube channel now has over 3 million subscribers[33] and many features and events are streamed on both that and the Radio 1 website.\\r\\nThe station also has a heavy presence on social media, with audience interaction now occurring mainly through Facebook and Twitter as well as text messaging.\\r\\nIt was announced in 2013 that Radio 1 had submitted plans to launch its own dedicated video channel on the BBC iPlayer[34] where videos of live performances as well as some features and shows would be streamed in a central location. Plans were approved by the BBC Trust in November 2014 and the channel launched on 10 November 2014.[35]\\r\\nNotable presenters include Clara Amfo, B.Traits, Benji B, Daniel P. Carter, Dev, Diplo, Matt Edmondson, Nick Grimshaw, Danny Howard, Ren LaVice, Annie Mac, Maya Jama, Greg James, Alice Levine, David Rodigan, Scott Mills, Annie Nightingale, Adele Roberts, Charlie Sloth, Cel Spellman, Huw Stephens, Toddla T, Phil Taggart, MistaJam, Katie Thistleton and Pete Tong\\r\\nBBC Radio 1 operates a system that separates all of the DJs between 'Day' and 'Night' DJs.\\r\\nThe breakfast show has been presented by many famous names over the years. Currently this slot is broadcast between 6:30?am and 10:00?am, Monday to Friday and is hosted by Nick Grimshaw.\\r\\nBBC Radio 1's chart show had aired the UK Singles Chart exclusively on Sunday afternoons since the programme began; but this was moved to Fridays in July 2015. Currently broadcasting from 4:00?pm until 5:45?pm, the format, length and starting time have varied over the years. For many years, the show prided itself on playing all 40 singles in the top 40 but this practice ended when Wes Butters took over as presenter in 2003; then only tracks below number 20 to be played were the new entries. The show took its current format on 10 July 2015, being presented by Greg James in his usual drive time slot. Random tracks from 40 - 11 are played and then the top 10 are played in full.\\r\\nRadio 1 provides alternative programming on some Bank Holidays. Programmes have included 'The 10 Hour Takeover', a request-based special, in which the DJs on air would encourage listeners to select any available track to play, 'One Hit Wonder Day' and 'The Chart Of The Decade' where the 150 biggest selling singles in the last 10 years were counted down and played in full.\\r\\nOn Sunday 30 September 2007, Radio 1 celebrated its 40th birthday.[36] To mark this anniversary Radio 1 hosted a week of special features, including:\\r\\nOn Saturday 30 September 2017, Radio 1 celebrated its 50th birthday. Tony Blackburn recreated the first ever Radio 1 broadcast on Radio 2[37], simulcast on pop-up station Radio 1 Vintage[38], followed by The Radio 1 Breakfast Show celebration, tricast on Radio 1, Radio 2 and Radio 1 Vintage, presented by Tony Blackburn and Nick Grimshaw, featuring former presenters Simon Mayo, Sara Cox and Mike Read [39].\\r\\nRadio 1 regularly supports charities Comic Relief, Sport Relief and Children in Need.\\r\\nOn 18 March 2011, BBC's Radio 1 longest serving breakfast DJ Chris Moyles and sidekick Dave Vitty broadcast for 52 hours as part of a Guinness World Record attempt, in aid of Comic Relief. The pair stayed on air for 52 hours in total setting a new world record for 'Radio DJ Endurance Marathon (Team) after already breaking Simon Mayo's 12-year record for Radio 1's Longest Show of 37 hours which he set in 1999, also for Comic Relief.\\r\\nThe presenters started on 16 March 2011 and came off air at 10:30?am on 18 March 2011. During this Fearne Cotton made a bet with DJ Chris Moyles that if they raise over S2,000,000 she will appear on the show in a swimsuit. After passing the S2,000,000 mark, Cotton appeared on the studio webcam in a stripy monochrome swimsuit. The appearance of Cotton between 10:10?am and 10:30?am caused the Radio 1 website to crash due to a high volume of traffic.\\r\\nIn total the event raised S2,622,421 for Comic Relief.[40]\\r\\nIn 1981, Radio 1 broadcast a radio adaptation of the space opera film, Star Wars.[41] The 13-episode serial was adapted for radio by the author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden, and was a co-production between the BBC and the American Broadcaster NPR.[42]\\r\\nThe Radio 1 Roadshow, which usually involved Radio 1 DJs and pop stars travelling around popular UK seaside destinations, began in 1973,[43] hosted by Alan Freeman in Newquay, Cornwall, with the final one held at Heaton Park, Manchester in 1999. Although the Roadshow attracted large crowds and the style changed with the style of the station itselfsuch as the introduction of whistlestop audio postcards of each location in 1994 (\\"2minuteTour\\")they were still rooted in the older style of the station, and therefore fit for retirement.[44]\\r\\nIn March 2000, Radio 1 decided to change the Roadshow format, renaming it One Big Sunday in the process. Several of these Sundays were held in large city-centre parks. In 2003, the event changed again and was rebranded One Big Weekend, with each event occurring biannually and covering two days. Under this name, it visited Derry in Northern Ireland, as part of the Music Lives campaign, and Perry Park in Birmingham.\\r\\nThe most recent change occurred in 2005 when the event was yet again renamed and the decision taken to hold only one per year, this time as Radio 1's Big Weekend. Venues under this title have included Herrington Country Park, Camperdown Country Park, Moor Parkÿwhich was the first Weekend to feature a third stageÿMote Park, Lydiard Park, Bangor and Carlisle Airport.\\r\\nTickets for each Big Weekend are given away free of charge, making it the largest free ticketed music festival in Europe.[45]\\r\\nBBC Radio 1's Big Weekend was replaced by a larger festival in 2012, named 'Radio 1's Hackney Weekend', with a crowd capacity of 100,000. The Hackney Weekend took place over the weekend of 23ÿ24 June 2012 in Hackney Marshes, Hackney, London. The event was to celebrate the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London and had artists such as Rihanna, Jay-Z and Florence and the Machine.[46]\\r\\nIn 2013, Radio 1's Big Weekend returned to Derry as part of the City of Culture 2013 celebrations. So far, Derry is the only city to have hosted the Big Weekend twice.\\r\\nIn May 2014, Radio 1's Big Weekend was held in Glasgow, Scotland. Acts which played at the event included Rita Ora, The 1975, Katy Perry, Jake Bugg and Pharrell Williams. The event was opened on the Friday with a dance set in George Square, featuring Radio 1 Dance DJs such as Danny Howard and Pete Tong, and other well-known acts such as Martin Garrix and Tiesto.\\r\\nIn 2015, the event was held in Norwich and featured performances from the likes of Taylor Swift, Muse, David Guetta, Years & Years and others.\\r\\n2016 saw the event make its way to Exeter. It was headlined by Coldplay who closed the weekend on the Sunday evening.\\r\\nThe event was in Hull in 2017 and saw performances by artists such as Zara Larsson, Shawn Mendes, Stormzy, Katy Perry, Little Mix, Sean Paul, Rita Ora, The Chainsmokers, Clean Bandit and Kings Of Leon.\\r\\nRadio 1 has annually held a dance music weekend broadcast live from Ibiza since the 1990s. The weekend is usually the first weekend in August and has performances from world-famous DJs and Radio 1's own dance music talent such as Pete Tong and Annie Mac.\\r\\nSince 2008 Radio 1 has held an annual event for teenagers aged 14 to 17 years. Originally named BBC Switch Live, the first event was held on 12 October 2008 at the Hammersmith Apollo. The event has been hosted by various Radio 1 DJs and guest co-hosts.\\r\\nIn 2010 the event was renamed 'BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards', and includes awards given to celebrities and particularly inspirational young people.

Its Gothic revival suite of buildings is the home of the Parliament of Canada and has architectural elements of national symbolic importance. Parliament Hill attracts approximately 3 million visitors each year. Law enforcement on parliament hill and in the parliamentary precinct is the responsibility of the Parliamentary Protective Service (PPS).[1]\\r\\nOriginally the site of a military base in the 18th and early 19th centuries, development of the area into a governmental precinct began in 1859, after Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the capital of the Province of Canada. Following a number of extensions to the parliament and departmental buildings and a fire in 1916 that destroyed the Centre Block, Parliament Hill took on its present form with the completion of the Peace Tower in 1927. Since 2002, an extensive $1 billion renovation and rehabilitation project has been underway throughout all of the precinct's buildings; work is not expected to be complete until after 2020.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nParliament Hill is a limestone outcrop with a gently sloping top that was originally covered in primeval forest of beech and hemlock.[3] For hundreds of years, the hill served as a landmark on the Ottawa River for First Nations and, later, European traders, adventurers, and industrialists, to mark their journey to the interior of the continent. After Ottawathen called Bytownwas founded, the builders of the Rideau Canal used the hill as a location for a military base,[3] naming it Barrack Hill. A large fortress was planned for the site, but was never built, and by the mid 19th century the hill had lost its strategic importance.\\r\\nIn 1858, Queen Victoria selected Ottawa as the capital of the Province of Canada, and Barrack Hill was chosen as the site for the new parliament buildings, given its prominence over both the town and the river, as well as the fact that it was already owned by the Crown.[4] On 7 May, the Department of Public Works issued a call for design proposals for the new parliament buildings to be erected on Barrack Hill, which was answered with 298 submitted drawings. After the entries were narrowed down to three, Governor General Sir Edmund Walker Head was approached to break the stalemate, and the winners were announced on August 29, 1859.\\r\\nThe Centre Block, departmental buildings, and a new residence for the governor general were each awarded separately, the team of Thomas Fuller and Chilion Jones, under the pseudonym of Semper Paratus, winning the prize for the first category with their Victorian High Gothic scheme of a formal, symmetrical front facing a quadrangle, and a more rustic, picturesque back facing the escarpment overlooking the Ottawa River. The team of Thomas Stent and Augustus Laver, under the pseudonym of Stat nomen in umbra, won the prize for the second category, which included the East and West Blocks.[5] These proposals were selected for their sophisticated use of Gothic architecture, which was thought to remind people of parliamentary democracy's history, would contradict the republican Neoclassicism of the United States' capital, and would be suited to the rugged surroundings while also being stately.[5] $300,000 was allocated for the main building, and $120,000 for each of the departmental buildings.[5]\\r\\nGround was broken on December 20, 1859, and the first stones laid on April 16 of the following year, and Prince Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), laid the cornerstone of the Centre Block on September 1.[6] The construction of Parliament Hill became the largest project undertaken in North America to that date. However, workers hit bedrock earlier than expected, necessitating blasting in order to complete the foundations, which had also been altered by the architects in order to sit 5.25 metres (17?ft) deeper than originally planned. By early 1861, Public Works reported that $1,424,882.55 had been spent on the venture, leading to the site being closed in September and the unfinished structures covered in tarpaulins until 1863, when construction resumed following a commission of inquiry.[5]\\r\\nTwo years later, the unfinished site hosted a celebration of Queen Victoria's birthday, further cementing the area's position as the central place for national outpouring. The site was still incomplete when three of the British North American colonies (now the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick) entered Confederation in 1867, with Ottawa remaining the capital of the new country. Within four years Manitoba, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, and the North-West Territories (now Alberta, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut) were added and, along with the associated bureaucracy, the first three required representation be added in parliament. Thus, the offices of parliament spread to buildings beyond Parliament Hill even at that early date.[3][5]\\r\\nThe British military gave a nine-pound naval cannon to the British army garrison stationed in Ottawa in 1854. It was purchased by the Canadian government in 1869 and fired on Parliament Hill for many years as the \\"Noonday Gun\\".[7]\\r\\nBy 1876, the structures of Parliament Hill were finished, along with the surrounding fence and gates. However, the grounds had yet to be properly designed; Governor General the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava sent chief architect Thomas Scott to New York City to meet with Calvert Vaux and view Central Park. Vaux completed a layout for the landscape of Parliament Hill, including the present day driveways, terraces, and main lawn, while Scott created the more informal grounds to the sides of and behind the buildings.[5] In 1901 they were the site of both mourning for, and celebration of, Queen Victoria, when the Queen's death was mourned in official ceremonies in January of that year, and when, in late September, Victoria's grandson, Prince George, Duke of Cornwall (later King George V), dedicated the large statue that stands on the hill in the late queen's honour.[8]\\r\\nFire destroyed the Centre Block on February 3, 1916. Despite the ongoing war, the original cornerstone was re-laid by Governor General Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, on September 1, 1916; exactly fifty-six years after his brother, the future King Edward VII, had first set it. Eleven years later, the new tower was completed and dedicated as the Peace Tower, in commemoration of the Canadians who had lost their lives during the First World War.[9]\\r\\nThereafter, The Hill hosted a number of significant events in Canadian history, including the first visit of the reigning Canadian sovereignKing George VI, with his consort, Queen Elizabethto his parliament, on May 19, 1939. VE Day was marked with a huge celebration on May 8, 1945, the first raising of the country's new national flag took place on February 15, 1965, the centennial of Confederation was celebrated on July 1, 1967, and the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II was marked on October 18, 1977. The Queen was back on Parliament Hill on April 17, 1982, to issue a royal proclamation of the enactment of the Constitution Act that year.\\r\\nIn April 1989, a Greyhound Lines bus with 11 passengers on board travelling to New York City from Montreal was hijacked by an armed man and driven onto the lawn in front of the Centre Block. A standoff with police ensued and lasted eight hours; though three shots were fired, there were no injuries.[10] After a second incident in September 1996 where an individual forcibly drove his car into the Centre Block doors and proceeded to attack RCMP officers standing guard, it was decided in the interests of national security that Parliament Hill, which up to that time had been open to limited public traffic on the lower lawn, would be restricted to government and media vehicles only.\\r\\nCrowds marked the beginning of the third millennium with a large ceremony on the quadrangle and the \\"largest single vigil\\" ever seen in the nation's capital took place in 2001, when 100,000 people gathered on the main lawn to honour the victims of the September 11 attacks on the United States that year.[11] The following year, Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee was marked on October 13, as was her Diamond Jubilee on February 6 (Accession Day) 2012.\\r\\nOn October 22, 2014, several shooting incidents occurred around Parliament Hill. A gunman, after fatally shooting a Canadian Army soldier mounting the ceremonial guard at the National War Memorial, moved to the Centre Block of the parliament buildings. There, he was killed in a shootout with RCMP officers and the Sergeant-At-Arms, Kevin Vickers. The gunman also injured one House of Commons constable, who was shot in the foot.[12]\\r\\nThe 88,480 square metres (952,391?sq?ft) area,[13] maintained by the National Capital Commission,[3] is named by the Parliament of Canada Act as Parliament Hill and defined as resting between the Ottawa River on the north, the Rideau Canal on the east, Wellington Street on the south, and a service road (Kent Street) near the Supreme Court on the west.[14] The south front of the property is demarcated by a Victorian High Gothic wrought iron fence, named the Wellington Wall and in the centre of which,[3] on axis with the Peace Tower to the north, sits the formal entrance to Parliament Hill: the Queen's Gates, forged by Ives & Co. of Montreal. At each southern corner of the quadrangle are also smaller gates for every-day access.\\r\\nThe main outdoor area of The Hill is the quadrangle, formed by the arrangement of the parliament and departmental buildings on the site, and laid out in a formal garden fashion. This expanse is the site of major celebrations, demonstrations, and traditional shows,[15] such as the changing of the guard, or the annual Canada Day celebrations. To the sides of the buildings, the grounds are set in the English garden style, dotted with statues, memorials, and, at the northwest corner, a Carpenter Gothic structure called the Summer Gazebo, a 1995 reconstruction of an earlier gazebo, Summer House, built for the Speaker of the House of Commons in 1877 by Thomas Seton Scott and demolished in 1956.[3] Beyond the edges of these landscaped areas, the escarpment remains in its natural state.[16]\\r\\nThough Parliament Hill remains the heart of the parliamentary precinct, expansion beyond the bounded area described above began in 1884, with the construction of the Langevin Block across Wellington Street. After land to the east, across the canal, was purchased by private interests (to build the Chateau Laurier hotel), growth of the parliamentary infrastructure moved westward along Wellington, with the erection in the 1930s of the Confederation and Justice Buildings on the north side, and then further construction to the south. By the 1970s, the Crown began purchasing other structures or leasing space deeper within the downtown, civic area of Ottawa. In 1973, the Crown expropriated the entire block between Wellington and Sparks Streets with the intent of constructing a south block for Parliament Hill.[17] However, the government dropped this proposal and instead, constructed more office space in Hull, Quebec, such as the Terrasses de la Chaudire and Place du Portage.\\r\\nIn 1976, the Parliament Buildings and the grounds of Parliament Hill were each designated as National Historic Sites of Canada, given their importance as the physical embodiment of the Canadian government and as the focal point of national celebrations.[18]\\r\\nThe Parliament of Canada Act renders it illegal for anyone to name any other area or establishment within the National Capital Region as Parliament Hill, as well as forbidding the production of merchandise with that name on it. Any violation of this law is punishable on summary conviction.[19]\\r\\nThe parliament buildings are three edifices arranged around three sides of Parliament Hill's central lawn, the use and administration of the spaces within each building overseen by the speakers of each chamber of the legislature.[3] The Centre Block has the Senate and Commons chambers, and is fronted by the Peace Tower on the south facade, with the Library of Parliament at the building's rear. The East and West Blocks each contain ministers' and senators' offices, as well as meeting rooms and other administrative spaces. Gothic Revival has been used as the unifying style of all three structures, though the Centre Block is a more modern Gothic Revival, while the older East and West Blocks are of a Victorian High Gothic. This collection is one of the world's most important examples of the Gothic Revival style; while the buildings' manner and design are unquestionably Gothic, they resemble no building constructed during the Middle Ages. The forms were the same, but their arrangement was uniquely modern. The parliament buildings also departed from the Medieval models by integrating a variety of eras and styles of Gothic architecture, including elements from Britain, France, the Low Countries, and Italy, all in three buildings. In his 1867 Hand Book to the Parliamentary and Departmental Buildings, Canada, Joseph Bureau wrote\\r\\nThe style of the Buildings is the Gothic of the 12th and 13th Centuries, with modifications to suit the climate of Canada. The ornamental work and the dressing round the windows are of Ohio sandstone. The plain surface is faced with a cream-coloured sandstone of the Potsdam formation, obtained from Nepean, a few miles from Ottawa. The spandrils  [sic] of the arches, and the spaces between window-arches and the sills of the upper windows, are filled up with a quaint description of stonework, composed of stones of irregular size, shape and color [sic], very neatly set together. These with the Potsdam red sandstone employed in forming the arches over the windows, afford a pleasant variety of color [sic] and effect, and contrast with the general masses of light coloured sandstone, of which the body of the work is composed.[20]\\r\\nThe sculptural ornament is overseen by the Dominion Sculptor.[21] Five people have held the position since its creation in 1936: Clophas Soucy (1936ÿ50), William Oosterhoff (1949ÿ62), Eleanor Milne (1962ÿ93), Maurice Joanisse (1993ÿ2006) and Phil R. White (2006ÿpresent).[3]\\r\\nThe only structure on Parliament Hill to have been purposefully demolished was the old Supreme Court building, which stood behind the West Block and housed the Supreme Court of Canada between 1889 and 1945. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, there were proposals to demolish other parliamentary precinct buildings, including the Library of Parliament and West Block for new structures, and the East Block for parking, but none of these plans were adopted.[22] Instead, renovations were undertaken to the East Block, beginning in 1966.\\r\\nIn 2002, an extensive $1 billion renovation project began across the parliamentary precinct,[23][24][25] specifically focusing on masonry restoration, asbestos removal, vehicle screening, parking, electrical and mechanical systems, and improved visitors' facilities.[26] The Library of Parliament and Peace Tower, as well as some exterior areas of masonry on the Centre Block have so far been completed, though focus has shifted to the West Block due to its rapidly deteriorating cladding. In 2018, when the Centre Block is slated to be closed for five years to carry out an extensive interior restoration and upgrade, the inner courtyard of the newly renovated West Block will be enclosed and fitted with a temporary chamber for the House of Commons while the Senate will be temporarily relocated down Wellington St. in The Government Conference Centre. Restoration of the East block is set to commence upon completion of Centre Block's restoration.[26]\\r\\nMost of the statues on Parliament Hill are arranged behind the three parliamentary buildings, with one outside of the main fence.\\r\\nA number of other monuments are distributed across the hill, marking historical moments or acting as memorials for larger groups of people.\\r\\n Media related to Parliament Hill at Wikimedia Commons","field3":"What city would you visit to see canadas parliament buildings?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Jay Berwanger","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The 1936 National Football League Draft was the first draft of the National Football League (NFL). It took place on February 8, 1936, at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania[1][2][3] The draft was instituted in an effort to equalize strength amongst the league's teams. The last place team from the previous season would get the first selection, and the process would continue in reverse order of the standings. Under this structure the Philadelphia Eagles, who finished 1935 at 2ÿ9, would select first.[4]\\r\\nThis was the only draft to have nine rounds; the number increased to ten for the 1937 draft. The first player ever drafted, Jay Berwanger, who had previously been awarded the initial Heisman Trophy, never played in the NFL. His rights were traded by the Philadelphia Eagles to the Chicago Bears, as the Eagles felt they would be unable to meet Berwanger's reported demand of $1000 per game.[4] The Eagles received tackle Art Buss from the Bears in exchange for Berwanger's rights.[5] George Halas was unable to convince Berwanger to sign with the Bears. Riley Smith, the second pick, was the first player drafted to play in the NFL.\\r\\nThe following is the breakdown of the 81 players selected:","field3":"Who was the first person drafted in the nfl?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"the epidermis","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"In biology, tissue is a cellular organizational level between cells and a complete organ. A tissue is an ensemble of similar cells and their extracellular matrix from the same origin that together carry out a specific function. Organs are then formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues.\\r\\nThe English word is derived from the French tissu, meaning something that is woven, from the verb tisser, \\"to weave\\".\\r\\nThe study of human and animal tissues is known as histology or, in connection with disease, histopathology. For plants, the discipline is called plant anatomy. The classical tools for studying tissues are the paraffin block in which tissue is embedded and then sectioned, the histological stain, and the optical microscope. In the last couple of decades,[clarification needed] developments in electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and the use of frozen tissue sections have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. With these tools, the classical appearances of tissues can be examined in health and disease, enabling considerable refinement of medical diagnosis and prognosis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimal tissues are grouped into four basic types: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Collections of tissues joined in structural units to serve a common function compose organs. While all animals can generally be considered to contain the four tissue types, the manifestation of these tissues can differ depending on the type of organism. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications of animals.\\r\\nThe epithelium in all birds and animals is derived from the ectoderm and endoderm with a small contribution from the mesoderm, forming the endothelium, a specialized type of epithelium that composes the vasculature. By contrast, a true epithelial tissue is present only in a single layer of cells held together via occluding junctions called tight junctions, to create a selectively permeable barrier. This tissue covers all organismal surfaces that come in contact with the external environment such as the skin, the airways, and the digestive tract. It serves functions of protection, secretion, and absorption, and is separated from other tissues below by a basal lamina.\\r\\nConnective tissues are fibrous tissues. They are made up of cells separated by non-living material, which is called an extracellular matrix. This matrix can be liquid or rigid. For example, blood contains plasma as its matrix and bone's matrix is rigid. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. Blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose and areolar tissues are examples of connective tissues. One method of classifying connective tissues is to divide them into three types: fibrous connective tissue, skeletal connective tissue, and fluid connective tissue.\\r\\nMuscle cells form the active contractile tissue of the body known as muscle tissue or muscular tissue. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle tissue is separated into three distinct categories: visceral or smooth muscle, found in the inner linings of organs; skeletal muscle, typically attached to bones, which generate gross movement; and cardiac muscle, found in the heart where it contracts to pump blood throughout an organism.\\r\\nCells comprising the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system are classified as nervous (or neural) tissue. In the central nervous system, neural tissues form the brain and spinal cord. In the peripheral nervous system, neural tissues forms the cranial nerves and spinal nerves, inclusive of the motor neurons.\\r\\nThe epithelial tissues are formed by cells that cover the organ surfaces such as the surface of skin, the airways, the reproductive tract, and the inner lining of the digestive tract. The cells comprising an epithelial layer are linked via semi-permeable, tight junctions; hence, this tissue provides a barrier between the external environment and the organ it covers. In addition to this protective function, epithelial tissue may also be specialized to function in secretion, excretion and absorption. Epithelial tissue helps to protect organs from microorganisms, injury, and fluid loss.\\r\\nFunctions of epithelial tissue:\\r\\nThere are many kinds of epithelium, and nomenclature is somewhat variable. Most classification schemes combine a description of the cell-shape in the upper layer of the epithelium with a word denoting the number of layers: either simple (one layer of cells) or stratified (multiple layers of cells). However, other cellular features, such as cilia may also be described in the classification system. Some common kinds of epithelium are listed below:\\r\\nIn plant anatomy, tissues are categorized broadly into three tissue systems: the epidermis, the ground tissue, and the vascular tissue.\\r\\nPlant tissues can also be divided differently into two types:\\r\\nMeristematic tissue consists of actively dividing cells, and leads to increase in length and thickness of the plant. The primary growth of a plant occurs only in certain, specific regions, such as in the tips of stems or roots. It is in these regions that meristematic tissue is present. Cells in these tissues are roughly spherical or polyhedral, to rectangular in shape, and have thin cell walls. New cells produced by meristem are initially those of meristem itself, but as the new cells grow and mature, their characteristics slowly change and they become differentiated as components of the region of occurrence of meristimatic tissues, they are classified as:\\r\\nThe cells of meristematic tissues are similar in structure and have thin and elastic primary cell wall made up of cellulose. They are compactly arranged without inter-cellular spaces between them. Each cell contains a dense cytoplasm and a prominent nucleus. Dense protoplasm of meristematic cells contains very few vacuoles. Normally the meristematic cells are oval, polygonal or rectangular in shape.\\r\\nMeristemetic tissue cells have a large nucleus with small or no vacuoles, they have no inter cellular spaces.\\r\\nThe meristematic tissues that take up a specific role lose the ability to divide. This process of taking up a permanent shape, size and a function is called cellular differentiation. Cells of meristematic tissue differentiate to form different types of permanent tissue. There are 3 types of permanent tissues:\\r\\nA group of cells which are similar in origin; similar in structure and similar in function are called simple permanent tissue. They are of four types:\\r\\nParenchyma (para - 'beside'; enchyma - 'tissue') is the bulk of a substance. In plants, it consists of relatively unspecialised living cells with thin cell walls that are usually loosely packed so that intercellular spaces are found between cells of this tissue. This tissue provides support to plants and also stores food. In some situations, a parenchyma contains chlorophyll and performs photosynthesis, in which case it is called a chlorenchyma. In aquatic plants, large air cavities are present in parenchyma to give support to them to float on water. Such a parenchyma type is called aerenchyma. some of parenchyma cells have metabolic waste and is known as idioblast. Spindle shape fibre also contained into this cell to support them and known as prosenchyma , succulent parenchyma also noted.\\r\\nCollenchyma is Greek word where \\"Collen\\" means gum and \\"chyma\\" means infusion. It is a living tissue of primary body like Parenchyma. Cells are thin-walled but possess thickening of cellulose, water and pectin substances (pectocellulose) at the corners where number of cells join together. This tissue gives a tensile strength to the plant and the cells are compactly arranged and have very little inter-cellular spaces. It occurs chiefly in hypodermis of stems and leaves. It is absent in monocots and in roots.sometimes it contains chlorophyll which can help them photosynthesis.\\r\\nCollenchymatous tissue acts as a supporting tissue in stems of young plants. It provides mechanical support, elasticity, and tensile strength to the plant body. It helps in manufacturing sugar and storing it as starch. It is present in the margin of leaves and resist tearing effect of the wind.\\r\\nSclerenchyma is Greek word where \\"Scleren\\" means hard and \\"chyma\\" means infusion. This tissue consists of thick-walled, dead cells and protoplasm is absent. These cells have hard and extremely thick secondary walls due to uniform distribution of lignin. Lignin deposition is so thick that the cell walls become strong, rigid and impermeable to water which is also known as stone cell. This type of tissues are mainly of two divisions: 1) Sclerenchyma fiber and 2) Sclereids. Schlerenchyma cells have a narrow lumen and are long and narrow.\\r\\nThe entire surface of the plant consists of a single layer of cells called epidermis or surface tissue. The entire surface of the plant has this outer layer of epidermis. Hence it is also called surface tissue. Most of the epidermal cells are relatively flat. The outer and lateral walls of the cell are often thicker than the inner walls. The cells forms a continuous sheet without inter cellular spaces. It protects all parts of the plant.\\r\\nThe complex tissue consists of more than one type of cells which work together as a unit. Complex tissues help in the transportation of organic material, water and minerals up and down the plants. That is why it is also known as conducting and vascular tissue. The common types of complex permanent tissue are:\\r\\nXylem and phloem together form vascular bundles.\\r\\nXylem consists of:\\r\\nXylem serves as a chief conducting tissue of vascular plants. It is responsible for the conduction of water and mineral ions/salt.\\r\\nXylem tissue is organized in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels (tracheae), while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity. Tracheids have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends. They do not have end openings such as the vessels. The tracheids ends overlap with each other, with pairs of pits present. The pit pairs allow water to pass from cell to cell.\\r\\nThough most conduction in xylem tissue is vertical, lateral conduction along the diameter of a stem is facilitated via rays. [1] Rays are horizontal rows of long-living parenchyma cells that arise out of the vascular cambium. In trees and other woody plants, rays radiate out from the center of stems and roots, and appear like spokes on a wheel in cross section. Rays, unlike vessel members and tracheids, are alive at functional maturity. [2]\\r\\nPhloem consists of:\\r\\nPhloem is an equally important plant tissue as it also is part of the 'plumbing system' of a plant. Primarily, phloem carries dissolved food substances throughout the plant. This conduction system is composed of sieve-tube member and companion cells, that are without secondary walls. The parent cells of the vascular cambium produce both xylem and phloem. This usually also includes fibers, parenchyma and ray cells. Sieve tubes are formed from sieve-tube members laid end to end. The end walls, unlike vessel members in xylem, do not have openings. The end walls, however, are full of small pores where cytoplasm extends from cell to cell. These porous connections are called sieve plates. In spite of the fact that their cytoplasm is actively involved in the conduction of food materials, sieve-tube members do not have nuclei at maturity. It is the companion cells that are nestled between sieve-tube members that function in some manner bringing about the conduction of food. Sieve-tube members that are alive contain a polymer called callose, a carbohydrate polymer, forming the callus pad/callus, the colourless substance that covers the sieve plate. Callose stays in solution as long as the cell contents are under pressure. Phloem transports food and materials in plants upwards and downwards as required.\\r\\nMineralized tissues are biological tissues that incorporate minerals into soft matrices. Such tissues may be found in both plants and animals, as well as algae. Typically these tissues form a protective shield against predation or provide structural support.\\r\\nThe term was introduced in anatomy by Marie Fran?ois Xavier Bichat in 1801.[3] He argued that the body functions would be better understood taking as unity of study the tissues, and not the organs. Bichat distinguished 21 types of elementary tissues for the human body, a number later reduced by other authors.","field3":"What are the three types of plant tissue?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"45?1?2 hours","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The Great North Road was the main highway between London and Scotland. It became a coaching route used by mail coaches travelling between London, York and Edinburgh. The modern A1 mainly parallels the route of the Great North Road. Coaching inns, many of which survive, were staging posts providing accommodation, stabling for horses and replacement mounts.[1] Nowadays virtually no surviving coaching inns can be seen while driving on the A1, because the modern route bypasses the towns in which the inns are found.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traditional starting point of the Great North Road was Smithfield Market in Clerkenwell, London. Hicks Hall, the first purpose-built sessions-house for the Middlesex justices of the peace, was built in 1611 immediately north of the market, on an island site in the middle of St John Street (where St John's Lane branches to the west); and this building was used as the initial datum point for mileages on the Great North Road. Its site continued to be used for this purpose even after the building was demolished soon after 1778.[2] The route followed St John Street to the junction of City Road and Pentonville Road (near Upper Street) in the north, at the Angel Inn. The Red Bull Theatre was on the street between 1604 and 1666, when it was destroyed in the Great Fire of London.[3] James Burnett, Lord Monboddo (1714ÿ1799) lived at 13 St John Street. He held \\"learned suppers\\" at his house, with guests including James Boswell, Robert Burns and Samuel Johnson.\\r\\nWhen the General Post Office at St Martin's-le-Grand was built in 1829, coaches started using an alternative route, now the modern A1 road, beginning at the Post Office and following Aldersgate Street and Goswell Road before joining the old route close to the Angel. The Angel Inn itself was an important staging post.[4] The next important stages were at Highgate, Barnet, Hatfield, Baldock, Biggleswade and Alconbury, all replete with traditional coaching inns.\\r\\nAt Alconbury, the Great North Road joined the Old North Road, an older route which followed the Roman Ermine Street. Here a milestone records mileages to London via both routes: 65 by the Old North Road and 68 by the Great North Road.[5] From Alconbury the Great North Road follows the line of Ermine Street north, through Stilton. Ermine Street crossed the River Welland about a mile to the west of what is now the town of Stamford. The Great North Road passed through the centre of Stamford, with two very sharp bends, re-joined the alignment of Ermine Street just before Great Casterton and continued as far as Colsterworth (at the A151 junction). Inns on this section included the George at Stamford and the Bell Inn at Stilton, the original sellers of Stilton cheese.\\r\\nAt Colsterworth the Great North Road diverges west of the Roman road and continues through Grantham, Newark, Retford and Bawtry to Doncaster. North of Doncaster the Great North Road again follows a short section of Ermine Street, the Roman Rigg or Roman Ridge. Further north the Great North Road crossed the Roman Dere Street near Boroughbridge from where it continued via Dishforth and Topcliffe to Northallerton and then through Darlington, Durham and Newcastle, on to Edinburgh. A road forked to the left at the bridge in Boroughbridge to follow Dere Street, and Scotch Corner to Penrith and on to Glasgow. Part of this route was the original A1, with a local road from Scotch Corner via Barton to Darlington making the link back to the old Great North Road.\\r\\nIn the first era of stage coaches York was the terminus of the Great North Road. Along the route DoncasterÿSelbyÿYork was superseded by the route DoncasterÿFerrybridgeÿWetherbyÿBoroughbridgeÿNorthallertonÿDarlington, the more direct way to Edinburgh, the final destination. The first recorded stage coach operating from London to York was in 1658 taking four days. Faster mail coaches began using the route in 1786, stimulating a quicker service from the other passenger coaches. In the \\"Golden Age of Coaching\\", between 1815 and 1835, coaches could travel from London to York in 20 hours, and from London to Edinburgh in 45?1?2 hours. In the mid-nineteenth century coach services could not compete with the new railways. The last coach from London to Newcastle left in 1842 and the last from Newcastle to Edinburgh in July 1847.[6]\\r\\nThe highwayman Dick Turpin's flight from London to York in less than 15 hours on his mare Black Bess is the most famous legend of the Great North Road. Various inns along the route claim Turpin ate a meal or stopped for respite for his horse. Harrison Ainsworth, in his 1834 romance Rookwood, immortalised the ride. Historians argue that Turpin never made the journey, claiming that the ride was by John Nevison, \\"Swift Nick\\", a highwayman in the time of Charles II, 50 years before Turpin who was born and raised at Wortley near Sheffield. It is claimed that Nevison, in order to establish an alibi, rode from Gad's Hill, near Rochester, Kent, to York (some 190 miles (310?km)) in 15 hours.\\r\\nThe Winchelsea Arms, an inn on a long straight section of the Great North Road near Stretton, Rutland, was reputed to be another haunt of Dick Turpin. It is now called the Ram Jam Inn after a story from the coaching days. A coach passenger undertook to show the landlady the secret of drawing both mild and bitter beer from the same barrel. Two holes were made and she was left with one thumb rammed against one and the other jammed into the other; the trickster then made off.[7]\\r\\nIn literature Jeanie Deans of Sir Walter Scott's novel The Heart of Midlothian travels through several communities on the Great North Road on her way to London. The road features in The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens. Part of the J. B. Priestley novel The Good Companions mentions the road which represented to northerner Jess Oakroyd, as the gateway to such exotic destinations as Nottingham. The Lord Peter Wimsey short story \\"The Fantastic Horror of the Cat in the Bag\\" by Dorothy L. Sayers features a motorcycle chase along it. Similarly, Ruined City by Nevil Shute features an all night drive from Henry Warren's house in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair, along the road as far as Rowley and then to Greenhead near Hadrian's Wall, where Warren is dropped off to go walking. His chauffeur, keen to get home for a date with the maid, is killed near Retford. In Cassandra Clare's Clockwork Princess, the third volume of The Infernal Devices trilogy, Will Herondale takes the road after leaving London on his way to Wales to find Tessa Gray.\\r\\nDick Whittington and His Cat, characters in an English story adapted for the stage in 1605, that, since the 19th century has become a pantomime, is loosely based on the historical Richard Whittington, a medieval Lord Mayor of London. The road is mentioned in Mark Knopfler's song, \\"5:15 AM\\", from the album Shangri La. The High Road mentioned in Loch Lomond is also a reference to it.[8] The song \\"Heading South on the Great North Road\\" on Sting's 2016 album 57th & 9th pays tribute to artists from the North East who found success in London by referencing to the Great North Road.[9]","field3":"How long did it take to travel from london to edinburgh by horse?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"West, East and Central Africa","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Although tropical Africa is most familiar in the West as depicted by its rain forests, this ecozone of Africa is far more diverse. While the tropics are thought of as regions with warm to hot moist climates caused by latitude and the tropical rain belt, the geology of areas, particularly mountain chains, and geographical relation to continental and regional scale winds impact the overall parts of areas[citation needed], also, making the tropics run from arid to humid in West Africa. The area has very serious overpopulation problems.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTropical rainforests are tropical moist forests of semi-deciduous varieties distributed across nine West African countries. Institute for Sea Research conducted a temperature record dating back to 700,000 years ago.[2] Several conservation and development demographic settings are such that the most loss of rain forests has occurred in countries of higher population growth. Lack of dependable data and survey information in some countries has made the account of areas of unbroken forest and/or under land use change and their relation to economic indicators difficult to ascertain. Hence, the amount and rate of deforestation in Africa are less known than other regions of tropics..\\r\\nThe term deforestation refers to the complete obstruction of forest canopy cover for means of agriculture, plantations, cattle-ranching, and other non-forest fields. Other forest use changes for example are forest disintegration (changing the spatial continuity and creating a mosaic of forest blocks and other land cover types), and dreadful conditions (selective logging of woody species for profitable purposes that affects the forest subfloor and the biodiversity).[2] The general meaning to the term deforestation is linked not only to the value system but the type of measurement designed to assess it. Thus, the same interpretations of deforestation cause noticeable changes in the estimate of forests cleared.\\r\\nOne reason for forest depletion is to grow cash crops. Nine West African countries depend on cash crop exports. Products like gum, copal, rubber, cola nuts, and palm oil provide rather steady income revenue for the West African countries. Land use change spoils entire habitats with the forests. Converting forests into timber is another cause of deforestation. Over decades, the primary forest product was commercial timber. Urbanized countries account for a great percentage of the world's wood consumption, that increased greatly between 1950 and 1980. Simultaneously, preservation measures were reinforced to protect European and American forests.[2] Economic growth and growing environmental protection in industrialized European countries made request for tropical hardwood become strong in West Africa. In the first half of the 1980s, an annual forest loss of 7,200 square kilometers was note down along the Gulf of Guinea, a figure equivalent to 4-5 per cent of the total remaining rain forest area.[2] By 1985, 72 per cent of West Africa's rainforests had been transformed into fallow lands and an additional 9 per cent had been opened up by timber exploitation.[2]\\r\\nTropical timber became a viable choice to European wood following World War II, as trade with East European countries stop and timber noticeably became sparse in western and southern Europe. Despite efforts to promote lesser known timber species use, the market continued to focus on part of the usable timber obtainable. West Africa was prone to selective harvesting practices; while conservationists blamed the timber industry and the farmers for felling trees, others believe rain forest destruction is connected to the problem of fuel wood.[2] The contribution of fuel wood consumption to tree stock decline in Africa is believed to be significant. It is generally believed that firewood provides 75 per cent of the energy used in sub-Sahara Africa.[2] With the high demand, the consumption of wood for fuel exceeds the renewal of forest cover.\\r\\nThe rain forests which remain in West Africa now merely are how they were hardly 30 years ago. In Guinea, Liberia and the Ivory Coast, there is almost no primary forest cover left unscathed; in Ghana the situation is much worse, and nearly all the rain forest are cut down. Guinea-Bissau loses 200 to 350?km2 of forest yearly, Senegal 500?km2 of wooded savanna, and Nigeria 6,000,050,000 of both. Liberia exploits 800?km2 of forests each year. Extrapolating from present rates of loss, botanist Peter Raven pictures that the majority of the world's moderate and smaller rain forests (such as in Africa,) could be ruined in forty years. Tropical Africa is about 18% of the world total covering 20 million km2 of land in West and Central Africa.[2] The region has been facing deforestation in various degrees of intensity throughout the recent decades. The actual rate of deforestation varies from one country to another and accurate data does not exist yet. Recent estimates show that the annual pace of deforestation in the region can vary from 150?km2 in Gabon to 2900?km2 in Cote d'Ivoire. Remaining tropical forest still cover major areas in Central Africa but are abridged by patches in West Africa.\\r\\nThe African Timber Organization member countries (ATO) eventually recognized the cooperation between rural people and their forest environment. Customary law gives residents the right to use trees for firewood, fell trees for construction, and collect of forest products and rights for hunting or fishing and grazing or clearing of forests for maintenance agriculture. Other areas are called \\"protected forests\\", which means that uncontrolled clearings and unauthorized logging are forbidden. After World War II, commercial exploitation increased until no West African forestry department was able of making the law. By comparison with rain forests in other places of the world in 1973, Africa showed the greatest infringement though in total volume means, African timber production accounted just one third compared to that of Asia.[2] The difference was due to the variety of trees in Africa forests and the demand for specific wood types in Europe.\\r\\nForestry regulations in east Africa were first applied by colonial governments, but they were not strict enough to fill forest exploitation. It wasnt until the 1970s that the inadequate performance of forest regulations was recognized. The Tropical Forestry Action Plan was conceived in 1987 by the World Resources Institute in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank with hopes of halting tropical forest destruction.[2] In its bid to stress forest conservation and development, the World Bank provided $111,103 million in building countries, especially in Africa, to help in developing long range forest conservation and management programs meant for ending deforestation.\\r\\nMany African countries are in economic and political change, overwhelmed by conflict, making various movements of forest exploitation to maintained forest management and production more and more complicated.\\r\\nForest legislation of ATO member countries aim to promote the balanced utilization of the forest domain and of wildlife and fishery in order to increase the input of the forest sector to the economic, social, cultural and scientific development of the country.[2]\\r\\nThe tropical environment is rich in terms of bio-diversity. Tropical African forest is 18 per cent of the world total and covers over 3.6 million square kilometers of land in West, East and Central Africa. This total area can be subdivided to 2.69 million square kilometers (74%) in Central Africa, 680,000 square kilometers (19%) in West Africa, and 250,000 square kilometers (7%) in East Africa.[2] In West Africa, a chain of rain forests up to 350?km long extends from the eastern border of Sierra Leone all the way to Ghana. In Ghana the forest zone gradually dispels near the Volta river, following a 300?km stretch of Dahomey savanna gap. The rain forest of West Africa continues from east of Benin through southern Nigeria and officially ends at the border of Cameroon along the Sanaga river.\\r\\nSemi-deciduous rainforests in West Africa began at the fringed coastline of Guinea Bissau (via Guinea) and run all the way through the coasts of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, continuing through Togo, Benin, Nigeria and Cameroon, and ending at the Congo Basin. Rain forests such as these are the richest, oldest, most prolific, and most complex systems on earth, are dying, and in turn are upsetting the delicate ecological balance. This may disturb global hydrological cycles, release vast amounts of green house gases into the atmosphere, and lessen the planet's ability to store excess carbon.\\r\\nThe rain forest vegetation of the Guinea-Congolian transition area, extending from Senegal to western Uganda are constituted of two main types: The semi-deciduous rain forest characterized by a large number of trees whose leaves are left during dry season. It appears in areas where the dry period (rainfall below about 100?mm) reach three months. Then, the evergreen or the semi-evergreen rain forest, climatically adapted to somewhat more humid conditions than the semi-deciduous type and is usually there in areas where the dry period is shorter than two months. This forest is usually richer in legumes and variety of species and its maximum development is around the Bight of Biafra, from Eastern Nigeria to Gabon, and with some large patches leaning to the west from Ghana to Liberia and to the east of Za?re-Congo basin.\\r\\nJudging against rain forest areas in other continents, most of the African rainforest is rather dry and receives between 1600 and 2000?mm of rainfall per year. Areas receiving more rain than this mainly are in coastal areas. The circulation of rainfall throughout the year remains less than other rain forest regions in the world. The average monthly rainfall in nearly the whole region remains under 100?mm throughout the year. The variety of the African rain forest flora is also less than the other rain forests. This lack of flora has been credited to several reasons such as the gradual infertility since the Miocene, severe dry periods during Quaternary, or the refuge theory of the cool and dry climate of tropical Africa during the last severe ice age of about 18000 years ago.[2]\\r\\nA recent vegetation map of Africa published by UNESCO and the main vegetation features of Central African rain forest divides the area into the following categories: . This type of forest shows no substantial seasonal behavior. At the border of the central basin is the mesophilous semi-deciduous forest that is mixed with deciduous and evergreen trees in the upper-stratum, unusual age distribution, continuous shrub stratum at the lower canopy, and a more marked seasonality.\\r\\nBeyond the forest reserves, a great deal of the remaining part of Central African rain forest on well drained soils are old secondary forests. There also exist younger secondary forests dominated by parasol trees, Musanga ceropiodes, the most abundant and characteristic secondary forest in Africa. Such trees are found in upper layers of secondary regrowth along the old road networks in Za?re . The dispersal of secondary forests are important in regional study as they show different floristic and faunistic characteristics than primary forests, and represent centers of human activity and history of land-use changes.\\r\\nThe nart comprises degraded lands, irregular agriculture and plantations., and deforested lands and fragmented forests. Plantations have a geometrical lay-out with uniform canopy-cover and follow a different vegetation cycle as their adjacent features. The areas are located near the transportation networks and are subjugated by economic tree crops such as cacao, rubber, oil palms and Kola.\\r\\nSwamp forest, inundated forests in flood plains, and riparian forests are found here. Swamp forests are found widely in the Za?re basin and throughout the Congo basin where conditions are appropriate. In most areas, swamp forests is like in appearance to rain forest and the tallest trees attain a height of 45 m. The main canopy is often irregular and open, sometimes resembling the secondary forests caused by disturbance The forest has a variety in endemic flora but it is inadequate in species. Recently, large areas of swamp forests have been cleared for rice farming. Swamp forests in Za?re, Congo and other lowland forests have seasonal variations that to the level of forest inundation.\\r\\nIn colonial rule, governments planned only one way to promote conservation. In Nigeria for example, the government introduced forest protection regulatory measures by classification of some forest areas, licensing requirements, and the apprehension and prosecution of offenders. Ghana issued classification permits to firms and executed log export restrictions. The Ivory Coast and Cameroon introduced log supply quotas, as Liberia did.\\r\\nThis trade product is \\"raw\\" lumber. Trees native to the West African rainforest from which timber is exported include limba, emeri, obeche and opepe as well as the exotic species gmelina, teak, and pinus.\\r\\nThe Tropical African rainforest has rich fauna, commonly smaller mammal species rarely seen by humans. New species continually are being found. For instance, in late 1988 an unknown shrub species was discovered on the shores of the Ndian River in Western Cameroon. Since then many species have become extinct. However, undisturbed rainforests are some of the richest habitats of animal species. Today, undisturbed rainforests are remnant, but rare. Timber extraction not only changes the edifice of the forest, it affects the tree species spectrum by removing economically important species and terminates other species in the process. The species that compose African rainforests are of different evolutionary ages because of the contraction and expansion of the rainforest in response to global climatic fluctuations.[2]\\r\\nIn Tropical Africa about 8,500 plant species have been noted and 403 species of orchids note down. The pygmy hippopotamus, the giant forest hog, the water chevortain and a number of insectivores, rodents and bats, tree frogs, bird species inhabit the area. These species, along with a diversity of fruits and insects, make a special habitat. Top canopy monkey species, the red colobus, and others, already have disappeared from much of Tropical Africa's forest.\\r\\nSpecies unfamiliar to the changes in forest structure for industrial use might not survive.[2] If timber use continues and an increasing amount of farming occurs, it could lead to the mass killing of animal species. The home of nearly half of the world's animals and plant species are tropical rainforests. The rain forests provide possible economic resource for over-populated developing countries. Despite the stated need to save the West African forests, there are divergence in how to work. In April 1992, countries with some of the largest surviving tropical rain forests banned a rainforest protection plan proposed by the British government. It aimed at finding endangered species of tropical trees in order to control trade in them. Experts estimate that the rainforest of West Africa, at the present trend of deforestation, may disappear by the year 2020.[2]\\r\\nAfricas rainforest, like many others emergent in the world, has a special significance to the indigenous cultures who have occupied them for millennia.[2]\\r\\nIn early 2007, scientists created an entirely new proxy to determine annual mean air temperature on landbased on molecules from the cell membrane of soil inhabiting bacteria. Recently, Scientists from the NIOZ, Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research conducted a temperature record dating back to 25,000 years ago.[3] In concord with the German colleague of the University of Bremen, this detailed record shows the history of land temperatures based on the molecular fossils of soil bacteria. When applying this to the outflow core of the Congo River, the core contained eroded land material and microfossils from marine algae. That concluded that the land environment of tropical Africa was cooled more than the bordering Atlantic Ocean during the last ice-age. Since the Congo River drains a large part of tropical central Africa, the land derived material gives an integrated signal for a very large area. These findings further enlighten in natural disparities in climate and the possible costs of a warming earth on precipitation in central Africa.[3]\\r\\nScientists discovered a way to measure sea temperaturebased on organic molecules from algae growing off the surface layer of the Ocean. These organisms acclimatize the molecular composition of their cell membranes to ambient temperature to sustain regular physiological properties. If such molecules sink to the sea floor and are buried in sediments where oxygen does not go through, they can be preserved for thousands of years. The ratios between the different molecules from the algal cell membrane can approximate the past temperature of the sea surface. The new proxy used in this sediment core obtained both a continental and a sea surface temperature record. In comparison, both records shows that ocean surface and land temperatures behaved differently during the past 25,000 years. During the last ice age, African temperatures were 21?C, about 4?C lower than today, while the tropical Atlantic Ocean was only about 2.5?C cooler. Lead author Johan Weijers and his colleagues arrived that the land-sea temperature difference has by far the largest influence on continental rainfall. The relation of air pressure to temperature strongly determines this factor. During the last ice age, the land climate in tropical Africa was drier than it is now, whereas it favors the growth of a lush rainforest.[3]\\r\\n[citation needed]","field3":"Where are africa's tropical rain forests found?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Premier Supermarkets, a subsidiary of Express Dairies","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"This is a list of supermarket chains in the United Kingdom.

It is open to school and college students on voluntary basis. National Cadet Corps is a Tri-Services Organization, comprising the Army, Navy and Air Force, engaged in grooming the youth of the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens. The National Cadet Corps in India is a voluntary organization which recruits cadets from high schools, colleges and universities all over India. The Cadets are given basic military training in small arms and parades. The officers and cadets have no liability for active military service once they complete their course but are given preference over normal candidates during selections based on the achievements in the corps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NCC in India was formed with the National Cadet Corps Act of 1948. It was raised on 15 July 1948. The origin of NCC can be traced back to the University Corps, which was created under the Indian Defence Act 1917, with the objective to make up the shortage of the Army. In 1920, when the Indian Territorial Act was passed, the University Corps was replaced by the University Training Corps (UTC). The aim was to raise the status of the UTC and make it more attractive to the youth. The UTC Officers and cadets dressed like the army. It was a significant step towards the Indianisation of armed forces. It was rechristened in the form of UOTC so the National Cadet Corps can be considered as a successor of the University Officers Training Corps (UOTC) which was established by the British Government in 1942. During World War II, the UOTC never came up to the expectations set by the British. This led to the idea that some better schemes should be formed, which could train more young men in a better way, even during peace. A committee headed by Pandit Hradaya Nath Kunjru recommended a cadet organization to be established in schools and colleges at a national level. The National Cadet Corps Act was accepted by the Governor General and on 15 July 1948 the National Cadet Corps came into existence.\\r\\nIn 1948, the Girls Division was raised in order to give equal opportunities to school and college going girls. The NCC was given an inter-service image in 1950 when the Air Wing was added, followed by the Naval Wing in 1952. Same year, the NCC curriculum was extended to include community development/social service activities as a part of the NCC syllabus at the behest of Late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who took keen interest in the growth of the NCC. Following the 1962 Sino-Indian War, to meet the requirement of the Nation, the NCC training was made compulsory in 1963. In 1968, the Corps was again made voluntary.[2]\\r\\nDuring Indo-Pakistani war of 1965 & Bangladesh-Pakistani war of 1971, NCC cadets were second line of defence. They organized camp to assist ordnance factories, supplying arms and ammunition to the front and also were used as patrol parties to capture enemy paratroopers. The NCC cadets also worked hand in hand with the Civil defence authorities and actively took part in rescue works and traffic control.[3]\\r\\nAfter 1965 and 1971 wars NCC syllabus was revised. Rather than just being second line of defence, NCC syllabus laid greater stress on developing quality of leadership and officer like qualities. The military training which the NCC cadets received was reduced and greater importance was given to other areas like social service and youth management.\\r\\nThe discussion for motto of NCC was started in 11th central advisory meeting(CAD) held on 11 August 1978. At that time there were many mottos in mind like \\"Duty and Discipline\\"; \\"Duty, Unity and Discipline\\"; \\"Duty and Unity\\"; \\"Unity and Discipline\\". later, at the 12thCAD meeting on 12 Oct 1980 they selected and declared \\"Unity and Discipline\\" as motto for the NCC.[4] In living up to its motto, the NCC strives to be and is one of the greatest cohesive forces of the nation, bringing together the youth hailing from different parts of the country and moulding them into united, secular and disciplined citizens of the nation.\\r\\nThe Aims of the NCC was laid out in 1988, NCC aims at developing discipline, character, brotherhood, the spirit of adventure and ideals of selfless service amongst young citizens. Not only these, it also aims to enlighten leadership qualities among the youth who will serve the Nation regardless of which career they choose.It also motivates they young to choose a career in armed forces.[5]\\r\\nIn 1954 the existing tricolor flag was introduced. The three colours in the flag depict the three services in the Corps, red for Army, deep blue for Navy and light blue for the Air Force. The letters NCC and the NCC crest in gold in the middle of the flag encircled by a wreath of lotus, give the flag a colourful look and a distinct identity. Each lotus represents one NCC Directorate(Dte).The two dots represents Officer Training Academy's in India they are at Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh and Kamptee, Maharashtra.\\r\\nWe the cadets of the national cadet corps,\\r\\ndo solemnly pledge that we shall always uphold the unity of India.\\r\\nWe resolve to be disciplined and responsible citizens of our nation.\\r\\nWe shall undertake positive community service in the spirit of selflessness and concern for our fellow beings.[6]\\r\\nThe desirability of composing a NCC song was consider63 and registered in 1969 with the approval of Ministry Of Defence. In 1974 it was felt that the NCC song has failed to catch the imagination of the youth and there was need for a change. In Oct 1982, it changed to . current NCC Song titled\\r\\n\\" Ham Sabh Bhartiya Hain\\". \\"Ham Sabh Bhartiya Hain\\" - NCC song is written by Sudarshan Faakir.\\r\\nEk Hai.\\r\\nIsko Apne Khoon Se Pala Hai\\r\\nBikhre Bikhre Taare Hain Hum\\r\\nThe NCC is headed by a Director General with the rank of lieutenant-general. He is assisted by two Additional Director Generals (A and B) of two-star rank (major-general, rear-admiral or air vice-marshal). Five Brigadier level officers and other civil officials also assist him. The Headquarters is located in Delhi. The organisational structure continues as follows:\\r\\nIn all there are 95 Group Headquarters in the country who exercise control over a network of 684 Army wing units (including technical and girls unit), 60 Naval wing units and 61 Air Squadrons. There are two training establishments namely Officers Training School, Kamptee (Nagpur, Maharashtra) and Women Officers Training School, Gwalior.\\r\\nThese 17 directorates are divided in total of 814 units divided in three service groups Army, Naval and Air. Out of those 684 are Army, 69 Naval and 61 Air units.[8]\\r\\nTypes of units and their numbers are given below:\\r\\nHowever, each unit can have up to 24 troops of senior division boys expanding their strength to 2400 cadets but this is maximum limit.\\r\\nJD boys and JW girls are given ranks up to sergeant. Only SD boys and SW girls are given ranks above sergeant.\\r\\nThe NCC directorates are headed by service officers of the rank of major general and equivalent; group headquarters are headed by service officers of the rank of brigadiers and equivalent, and units are headed by service officers of the rank of colonel(TS)/lieutenant colonel/major or equivalent. They are responsible for proper training, planning and execution of NCC activities.\\r\\nA cadre of whole time lady officers (WTLO) with cadre strength 110 officers has been sanctioned in 1995. They are to be commissioned partly through departmental channel and partly through UPSC in a phased manner.\\r\\nANO is an important link in the NCC organization between the BN and the cadets. As amatter of fact, ANO is the feeder node of NCC since he / she is the one who is in direct contact with the cadets all throughout the year. There are two training establishments namely Officers Training Academy, Kamptee and Women Officers Training Academy, Gwalior. These two institutions train the school and college teachers selected to head the company/troop. Courses in these institutions range from 21 days to 90 days in duration.\\r\\nAssociate NCC officers are given following ranks according to their seniority and their training.\\r\\nArmy cadets wear khaki uniform. Naval cadets wear white uniform of Navy. Air Force cadets wear light blue grey (LBG) uniform. The uniform is compulsory on all the occasions.\\r\\nCadets from SD boys Army wing wear khaki full sleeve shirt and trousers & cadets from JD wear khaki shirt & khaki shorts. Girl cadets from SW & JW both wear khaki full sleeve shirt and trousers. Cadets from SD boys Naval wing wear white half sleeve shirt and white trousers & JD boys wear half sleeve white shirt and white shorts. Girls from Naval wing SW & JW wear white half sleeve shirt and trousers. Cadets from SD boys Air wing wear light blue half sleeve shirts and trousers & JD cadets wear light blue half sleeve shirts and trousers. Girls from SW and JW wear light blue half sleeve shirts and trouser.\\r\\nIn addition to these SW & JW cadets wear white salwar and kamiz during activities other than parade. Rifle green beret is compulsory for all the cadets except Sikh cadets who wear rifle green turban. For physical training cadets wear brown canvas shoes and for drills black leather shoes called D.M.S (Drill March Shoes). Woolen vests are compulsory in cold areas whose colour varies khaki for army, dark blue for navy, and black for air. (Even NCC cadets wear INDIAN ARMY uniforms sometimes.)\\r\\nTotal training period for SD and SW is 3 years with an extension of 1 year permissible & training period for JD & JW is of 2 years. Every cadet of the Senior or Junior Division has to undergo service training for a period of at least 4 hours per week during the training year. However, no training is carried out during periods when the college or school through which a cadet is enrolled is closed for a vacation. Every cadet of the Senior and Junior Division has undergo service training for a minimum period of 75% of total hours during the annual college and school session. Every cadet (in case of JD, who has completed one full year of training and is in his second year) attends an annual training camp of 9ÿ10 days, also known as National Combined Annual Training Camp. For SD/SW the duration is usually for up to 30 days. At the end of the camp training the cadets receive a certificate of successful completion.\\r\\nThere are Three Certificates in NCC. Below describes about it from lower value to higher value:-\\r\\nThree certificates are awarded (1) A grade, (2) B grade, (3) C grade.\\r\\nThe best certificate is C, which has the highest value. (i) A cadet has to obtain 45% marks in each paper & 50% marks in the aggregate to pass the examination. Grading is based on total marks obtain will be awarded as follows. (aa) Grading 'A' - Cadets obtaining 80% marks and above. (ab) Grading 'B' - Cadets obtaining 65% marks and above but below 80%. (ac) Grading 'C' - Cadets obtaining 50% marks and above but below 65%.

The camp acts as a refresher training for the cadets and they are also trained in basic skills of survival and emergencies besides other topics. They are taught certain skills pertaining specifically to their Wing for e.g., a Naval cadet is trained in boat-rowing, oaring, Semaphore, etc. Another activity in the camp is the \\"dogwatch\\" wherein two cadets are to stay on sentry duty for two hours at any time given time of the day. Those caught sleeping, especially during late night or early morning shifts, or otherwise missing from duty are severely reprimanded or penalized.

This camp is full of adventure.\\r\\nThe TSC is a 12 days camp conducted in Delhi every year in the late autumn, in which the cadets are selected from all 17 directorates (30+3 SD/JD and SW/JW cadets from each directorate), by the selection procedure conducting 3 pre-TSC camps each of 10ÿ12 days in a week interval. The selected cadets then are sent to the TSC to represent their respective directorates in the following competitions:\\r\\nThe directorates also get marks by the inspection of their respective accommodations, dressing and some extracurricular activities by the inspecting squad. Arranging the numbers, the winning directorate gets a cup with decorations from the Director General, NCC on the closing day of the TSC.

It provides expert advice, training and grants support to developing countries, with increasing emphasis on assistance to the least developed countries. It promotes technical and investment cooperation among nations. The status of UNDP is that of an executive board within the United Nations General Assembly. The UNDP Administrator is the third highest-ranking official of the United Nations after the United Nations Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General.[3]\\r\\nTo accomplish the SDGs and encourage global development, UNDP focuses on poverty reduction, HIV/AIDS, democratic governance, energy and environment, social development, and crisis prevention and recovery. UNDP also encourages the protection of human rights and the empowerment of women in all of its programmes. The UNDP Human Development Report Office also publishes an annual Human Development Report (since 1990) to measure and analyse developmental progress. In addition to a global Report, UNDP publishes regional, national, and local Human Development Reports.[4]\\r\\nUNDP is funded entirely by voluntary contributions from member nations. The organization operates in 177 countries, where it works with local governments to meet development challenges and develop local capacity. Additionally, the UNDP works internationally to help countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UNDP was one of the main UN agencies involved in the development of the Post-2015 Development Agenda.\\r\\nUNDP works with nations on their own solutions to global and national development challenges. As they develop local capacity, they draw on the people of UNDP and its wide range of partners. However UNDP offers to help only if the different nations request it to do so.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UNDP was founded on 22 November 1965 with the merging of the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance (EPTA) and the Special Fund.[6] The rationale was to \\"avoid duplication of [their] activities\\". The EPTA was set up in 1949 to help the economic and political aspects of underdeveloped countries while the Special Fund was to enlarge the scope of UN technical assistance.[7] The Special Fund arose from the idea of a Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED) (which was initially called UNFED).\\r\\nCountries such as the Nordic countries were proponents of such a United Nations (UN) controlled fund. However, the fund was opposed by developed countries, especially by the United States who was wary of the Third World dominating such a funding and preferred it to be under the auspices of the World Bank. The concept of SUNFED was dropped to form the \\"Special Fund\\". This Special Fund was some compromise over the SUNFED concept, it did not provide investment capital, but only helped to bring pre-conditions for private investment.\\r\\nWith the US proposing and creating the International Development Association within the World Bank's umbrella, the EPTA and the Special Fund appeared to be conducting similar work. In 1962, the United Nations Economic and Social Council asked the Secretary General to consider the merits and disadvantages of merging UN technical assistance programs and in 1966, the EPTA and the Special Fund merged to form the UNDP.[8][9][10]\\r\\nIn 2013, UNDPs entire budget was approximately US$5 billion.[11]\\r\\nThe following table lists the top 15 DAC 5 Digit Sectors[12] to which UNDP has committed funding, as recorded in its International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) publications. The UNDP claims on the IATI Registry website that the data covers 100% of development flows.[13]\\r\\nUNDP topped the Aid Transparency Index published by Publish What You Fund in 2015 and 2016. \\"The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) tops the Index for the second time with an excellent score of 93.3%, the only organisation to score above 90%\\". [14]\\r\\nUNDPs offices and staff are on the ground in 177 countries, working with governments and local communities to help them find solutions to global and national development challenges.\\r\\nUNDP links and coordinates global and national efforts to achieve the goals and national development priorities laid out by host countries. UNDP focuses primarily on five developmental challenges:\\r\\nUNDP supports national democratic transitions by providing policy advice and technical support, improving institutional and individual capacity within countries, educating populations about and advocating for democratic reforms, promoting negotiation and dialogue, and sharing successful experiences from other countries and locations. UNDP also supports existing democratic institutions by increasing dialogue, enhancing national debate, and facilitating consensus on national governance programmes.\\r\\nUNDP helps countries develop strategies to combat poverty by expanding access to economic opportunities and resources, linking poverty programmes with countries larger goals and policies, and ensuring a greater voice for the poor. It also works at the macro level to reform trade, encourage debt relief and foreign investment, and ensure the poorest of the poor benefit from globalisation. On the ground, UNDP sponsors developmental pilot projects, promotes the role of women in development, and coordinates efforts between governments, NGOs, and outside donors. In this way, UNDP works with local leaders and governments to provide opportunities for impoverished people to create businesses and improve their economic condition.\\r\\nThe UNDP International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth (IPC-IG) in Braslia, Brazil expands the capacities of developing countries to design, implement and evaluate socially inclusive development projects. IPC-IG is a global forum for South-South policy dialogue and learning, having worked with more than 7,000 officials from more than 50 countries.\\r\\nA 2013 evaluation of the UNDPs poverty reduction efforts states that the UNDP has effectively supported national efforts to reduce poverty, by helping governments make policy changes that benefit the poor.[15] Nevertheless, the same evaluation also states there is a strong need for better measurement and monitoring of the impacts of the UNDP's work.[16] The UNDPs Strategic Plan 2014-2017 incorporates the recommendations of this poverty evaluation.[17]\\r\\nUNDP works to reduce the risk of armed conflicts or disasters, and promote early recovery after crisis have occurred. UNDP works through its country offices to support local government in needs assessment, capacity development, coordinated planning, and policy and standard setting.\\r\\nExamples of UNDP risk reduction programmes include efforts to control small arms proliferation, strategies to reduce the impact of natural disasters, and programmes to encourage use of diplomacy and prevent violence. Recovery programmes include disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, demining efforts, programmes to reintegrate displaced persons, restoration of basic services, and transitional justice systems for countries recovering from warfare.\\r\\nAs the poor are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation and lack of access to clean, affordable water, sanitation and energy services, UNDP seeks to address environmental issues in order to improve developing countries abilities to develop sustainably, increase human development and reduce poverty. UNDP works with countries to strengthen their capacity to address global environmental issues by providing innovative policy advice and linking partners through environmentally sensitive development projects that help poor people build sustainable livelihoods.\\r\\nUNDPs environmental strategy focuses on effective water governance including access to water supply and sanitation, access to sustainable energy services, Sustainable land management to combat desertification and land degradation, conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and policies to control emissions of harmful pollutants and ozone-depleting substances. UNDP's Equator Initiative office biennially offers the Equator Prize to recognize outstanding indigenous community efforts to reduce poverty through the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and thus making local contributions to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\\r\\nIn 2012 the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) was established. BIOFIN brings 30 countries together to develop and implement evidence-based finance plans to safeguards biodiversity.

The first group of Puerto Ricans immigrated to New York City in the mid-19th century when Puerto Rico was a Spanish Province and its people Spanish citizens. The following wave of Puerto Ricans to move to New York City did so after the SpanishÿAmerican War in 1898.[1] Puerto Ricans were no longer Spanish subjects and citizens of Spain, they were now Puerto Rican citizens of an American possession and needed passports to travel to the mainland of the United States.\\r\\nThat was until 1917, when the United States Congress approved Jones-Shafroth Act which gave Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico a U.S. citizenship with certain limitations. Puerto Ricans living in the mainland United States however, were given full American citizenship and were allowed to seek political office in the states which they resided. Two months later, when Congress passed the Selective Service Act, conscription was extended to the Puerto Ricans both in the island and in the mainland. It was expected that Puerto Rican men 18 years and older serve in the U.S. military [2] during World War I.[3] The Jones-Shafroth Act also allowed Puerto Ricans to travel between Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland without the need of a passport, thereby becoming migrants. The advent of air travel was one of the principal factors that led to the largest wave of migration of Puerto Ricans to New York City in the 1950s, known as \\"The Great Migration\\". Similar to many other eastcoast cities, Puerto Ricans were the first Hispanic group to move to New York City in large numbers.\\r\\nFrom 1970 until about 1990, the city's Puerto Rican population was at its height, they represented up to 80% of the city's Hispanic community and 12% of the city's total population, at that time nearly 70% of Puerto Ricans lived in New York. It wasn't until the 1990s, that the percentage Puerto Ricans made up of the city's Hispanic community and the total population as a whole started to decrease, largely due to a declining Puerto Rican population, increasingly diversifying Hispanic community, and New York City rebounding its economy after deindustrialization, which ultimately resulted in a faster growing city population and dwindling Puerto Rican influence. However, since the early 2010s, New York's Puerto Rican population started to grow again, being in the midst of another major migration wave out of Puerto Rico.\\r\\nAccording to the 2010 census, Puerto Ricans represent 8.9 percent of New York City alone (32% of the city's Hispanic community), and 5.5% of New York State as a whole.[4] Over a million Puerto Ricans in the state, about 70% are present in the city, with the remaining portion scattered in the city's suburbs and other major cities throughout New York State. Although Florida has received some dispersal of the population, there has been a resurgence in Puerto Rican migration to New York and New Jersey, primarily for economic and cultural considerations[5][6] - consequently, the New York City Metropolitan Area has witnessed a significant increase in its Puerto Rican population from 1,177,430 in 2010 to a Census-estimated 1,494,670 in 2016,[7] maintaining its status by a significant margin as the most important cultural and demographic center for Puerto Ricans outside San Juan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 19th century, commerce existed between the ports of the East Coast of the United States and the Spanish colony of Puerto Rico. Ship records show that many Puerto Ricans traveled on ships that sailed from and to the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Many of them settled in places such as New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, many Puerto Ricans, such as Lieutenant Augusto Rodriguez, joined the ranks of military armed forces, however since Puerto Ricans were Spanish subjects they were inscribed as Spaniards.[8] The earliest Puerto Rican enclave in New York City was in Manhattan. Most of the Puerto Ricans who moved there came from well-to-do families or were people whose economic situation could permit them the luxury of traveling from the island to New York City by way of steamship, an expensive and long trip. Amongst the first Puerto Ricans to immigrate to New York City were men and women who were exiled by the Spanish Crown for their political beliefs and struggles for the cause of Puerto Rican independence. By 1850, Puerto Rico and Cuba were the only two remaining Spanish colonies in the New World. The Spanish Crown would either imprison or banish any person who promoted the independence of these two nations.[9] Two of these exiles were Ram܇n Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis who together founded \\"The Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico\\" in New York. They were the planners of the short and failed 1868 revolt against Spain in Puerto Rico known as El Grito de Lares.[10] Another prominent Puerto Rican who in 1871 immigrated to New York was Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, considered by many as the \\"Father of Black History\\". He too became a member of the \\"Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico\\" and was an outspoken promoter of not only the independence of Puerto Rico but of Cuba's also.[11]\\r\\nFour other Puerto Ricans who moved to New York because of political reasons were Manuel Besosa, Antonio Vlez Alvarado, Juan Rus Rivera and Francisco Gonzalo Marn. These four Puerto Ricans joined the Cuban Liberation Army whose headquarters was in New York City.\\r\\nSome sources document Francisco Gonzalo Marn with presenting a Puerto Rican flag prototype in 1895 for adoption by the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. Marn has since been credited by some with the flag's design.[12] There is a letter written by Juan de Mata Terreforte which gives credit to Marin. The original contents of the letter in Spanish are the following:[13]\\r\\nWhich translated in English states the following:\\r\\nIt is also believed that on June 12, 1892, Antonio Vlez Alvarado was at his apartment at 219 Twenty-Third Street in Manhattan, when he stared at a Cuban flag for a few minutes, and then took a look at the blank wall in which it was being displayed. Vlez suddenly perceived an optical illusion, in which he perceived the image of the Cuban flag with the colors in the flag's triangle and stripes inverted. Almost immediately he visited a nearby merchant, Domingo Peraza, from whom he bought some crepe paper to build a crude prototype. He later displayed his prototype in a dinner meeting at his neighbor's house, where the owner, Micaela Dalmau vda. de Carreras, had invited Jos Mart as a guest.[14]\\r\\nIn a letter written by Maria Manuela (Mima) Besosa, the daughter of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee member Manuel Besosa, she stated that she sewed the flag. This created a belief that her father could have been its designer.\\r\\nEven though Marn presented the Puerto Rican Flag in New York's \\"Chimney Corner Hotel\\",[15] it may never be known who designed the current flag. What is known, however, is that on December 22, 1895, the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee officially adopted a design which is today the official flag of Puerto Rico.\\r\\nIn 1897, Antonio Mattei Lluberas, a wealthy coffee plantation owner from Yauco, visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. There he met with Ram܇n Emeterio Betances, Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio Mndez Martinez and together they proceeded to plan a major coup. The uprising, which became known as the Intentona de Yauco was to be directed by Betances, organized by Aurelio Mendez Mercado and the armed forces were to be commanded by General Juan Rus Rivera from Cuba.[16] The political immigration to New York practically came to a halt in 1898 after the SpanishÿAmerican War when Puerto Rico became a possession of the United States. It is estimated that 1,800 Puerto Rican citizens (they were not American citizens until 1917) had immigrated to New York during this period.[17]\\r\\nIn 1902, the United States Treasury Department issued new immigration guidelines that changed the status of all Puerto Ricans to \\"foreigners.\\" Isabel Gonzalez was a young single mother who was expecting her second child. Her fianc, who was in New York, sent for her with the intention of getting married. When Gonzalez arrived in New York, she and all the Puerto Ricans who were with her, were detained in Ellis Island and denied entry. She was accused of being an alien and as an unwed parent she was deemed as a burden to the welfare system of the country. Gonzalez challenged the Government of the United States in the groundbreaking case \\"GONZALES v. WILLIAMS' (her surname was misspelled by immigration officials). The Supreme Court ruled that under the immigration laws Gonzlez was not an alien, and therefore could not be denied entry into New York. It also stated that Puerto Ricans were not U.S. citizens, they were \\"noncitizen nationals.\\" Gonzalez, who became an activist on behalf of all Puerto Ricans, paved the way for the Jones-Shafroth Act, which conferred United States citizenship on all citizens of Puerto Rico.[18]\\r\\nIn 1917, the United States entered World War I and that same year the United States Congress approved the Jones-Shafroth Act which gave Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship. Puerto Ricans no longer needed a passport to travel to the U.S. and were allowed to seek public office in the mainland U.S.[19] The economic situation in the island was bad and continued to worsen as a result of the many hurricanes which destroyed most of its crops. Many Puerto Rican families migrated to the United States, the bulk of whom went to New York, in search of a better way of life.[17] In New York, they faced the same hardships and discrimination that earlier groups of immigrants, such as the Irish, the Italians, and the Jews, had faced before them. It was difficult for them to find well paying jobs because of the language barrier and their lack of technical working skills. The few men who found jobs worked for low salaries in factories. The women usually stayed home as housewives and tended to their children. Those who did not find jobs had the option of joining the United States Military.[20] Prior to the Jones-Shafroth Act, Puerto Ricans in the mainland United States as all other non-citizens, who were permanent residents were required to register with the Selective Service System by law and could be drafted,[21] however one of the effects of the Act was that all Puerto Ricans were now eligible for the military \\"draft\\" (conscription). One of the military units at that time was New York's U.S. 369th Infantry Regiment. Rafael Hernndez was a Puerto Rican who served in the almost all Afro-American unit. The unit fought against the Germans in France and became known[by whom?] as the \\"Harlem Hell Fighters\\". Hernndez, his brother Jesus and 16 other Puerto Ricans was assigned to the United States Army's Harlem Hell fighters musical band, the Orchestra Europe.\\r\\nNero Chen was one of the many Puerto Ricans who settled in East Harlem. He became the first Puerto Rican boxer to gain acclaim when in 1917 he fought against \\"Panama Joe Gans\\" at Harlem's Palace Casino which was located at 28 East 135th St., between Fifth and Madison Avenues, in Manhattan.[22] As evidenced by an early 1924 poster, migrants in New York organized baseball teams which played against each other. The poster announces a game which was held at Howard Field in Brooklyn between two teams, the San Juan B.B.C. and the Porto Rican Stars, made of Puerto Ricans from the East Side section of Manhattan.\\r\\nAs the economic situation in the United States worsened in a prelude to the Great Depression, many Puerto Ricans in the mainland found themselves competing with other groups for the positions of unskilled labor such as dishwashers, maintenance and laundry workers. This led to the \\"Harlem Riots\\" of July 1926. between unemployed Jews and Puerto Ricans. Various Puerto Rican organizations in East Harlem, organized a media campaign to ease the tensions between the groups involved and called upon the mayor, governor of the state to restore order and provide protection to the area.[23]\\r\\nIn 1937, Oscar Garcia Rivera, Sr. (1900ÿ1969), a native of Mayagez and resident of East Harlem, became the first Puerto Rican to be elected to public office in the continental United States as a member of the New York State Assembly. A witness of the discrimination which Puerto Ricans were subject to, he created the \\"Unemployment Insurance Bill\\" which paved the way for the passage of bills which established minimum hours and wages for working people, the creation of a Wage Board within the Labor Department, and the right of employees to organize and negotiate grievances. In 1956, he also became the first Puerto Rican to be nominated as the Republican candidate for Justice of the City Court.[24]\\r\\nSeveral factors contributed and led to what came to be known as \\"The Great Migration\\" of Puerto Ricans to New York. These were the following: the Great Depression, World War II and the advent of air travel.\\r\\nThe Great Depression which spread throughout the world was also felt in Puerto Rico. Since the island's economy was and still is dependent to that of the United States, it was to be expected that when the American banks and industries began to fail the effect would be felt in the island. Unemployment was on the rise as a consequence and therefore, many families fled to the mainland U.S.A. in search of jobs.[25]\\r\\nThe outbreak of World War II opened the doors to many of the migrants who were searching for jobs. Since a large portion of the male population of the U.S. was sent to war, there was a sudden need of manpower to fulfill the jobs left behind. Puerto Ricans, both male and female, found themselves employed in factories and ship docks, producing both domestic and warfare goods. The new migrants gained the knowledge and working skills which in the future would serve them well. The military also provided a steady source of income,[9] in 1944, the Puerto Rican WAC unit, Company 6, 2nd Battalion, 21st Regiment of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, a segregated Hispanic unit, was assigned to the New York Port of Embarkation, after their basic training at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. They were assigned to work in military offices which planned the shipment of troops around the world.[26][27]\\r\\nThe advent of air travel provided Puerto Ricans with an affordable and faster way of travel to New York. The one thing that most migrants had in common was that they wanted a better way of life than was available in Puerto Rico, and although each held personal reasons for migrating, their decision generally was rooted in the island's impoverished conditions as well as the public policies that sanctioned migration.[17]\\r\\nIn 1948, the Migration Division of the Department of Labor of Puerto Rico opened its office in New York City. Its mission was to mediate between the island and the New York/Puerto Rican community, assuage the adjustment experience of new arrivals, and generally inform them about jobs, housing and other critical concerns.[28] It wasn't long before the Puerto Rican \\"Barrios\\" in the Williamsburg, Bushwick, South Bronx, Spanish Harlem, and Manhattan's Lower East Side began to resemble \\"Little Puerto Ricos\\" with their \\"Bodegas\\" (small grocery stores) and \\"Piragueros\\" (Puerto Rican shaved ice venders) in every corner.[29] It is estimated that from 1946 to 1950 there were 31,000 Puerto Rican migrants each year to New York.\\r\\nPuerto Ricans began to form their own small \\"barrios\\", in The Bronx, Brooklyn and in East Harlem (which would become known as Spanish Harlem).[30] It was in East Harlem where the Puerto Rican migrants established a cultural life of great vitality and sociality. They also participated in some of the sports, such as boxing and baseball which were first introduced in the island by the American Armed Forces after the SpanishÿAmerican War.[31]\\r\\nPuerto Ricans who moved to New York not only took with them their customs, traditions, they also took with them their piraguas, a Puerto Rican frozen treat, shaped like a pyramid, made of shaved ice and covered with fruit flavored syrup.[25][32] According to Holding Aloft the Banner of Ethiopia: by Winston James, piraguas were introduced in New York by Puerto Ricans as early as 1926.\\r\\nPuerto Rican music flourished with the likes of Rafael Hernndez and Pedro Flores who formed the \\"Trio Borincano\\" and gained recognition in the city. Myrta Silva who later joined Hernandez's \\"Cuarteto Victoria\\" also gained fame as a singer after the group traveled and played throughout the United States.[29]\\r\\nThe South Bronx became a hub for Puerto Rican music. Theaters which had served to previous groups of immigrants, such as the Irish and the Italians, for their dramatic works or vaudeville style shows, now served the growing Puerto Rican and Latino population with musical performances from musicians from Puerto Rico and Latin America. Plus, the local Bronx's burgeoning Latino musicians. Among these theaters were the historical Teatro Puerto Rico at E. 138th St. and Hunts Point Palace in Southern Blvd. During the Teatro Puerto Rico's \\"golden era\\", which lasted from 1947 to 1956, musician Jos Feliciano made his stateside debut[33]\\r\\nNew York City also became the mecca for freestyle music in the 1980s, of which Puerto Rican singer-songwriters represented an integral component.[34] Puerto Rican influence in popular music continues in the 21st century, encompassing major artists such as Jennifer Lopez.[35]\\r\\nThe third great wave of domestic migration from Puerto Rico came after World War II. Nearly 40,000 Puerto Ricans settled in New York City in 1946, and 58,500 in 1952ÿ53. Many soldiers who returned after World War II made use of the GI Bill and went to college. Puerto Rican women confronted economic exploitation, discrimination, racism, and the insecurities inherent in the migration process on a daily basis, however they fared better than did men in the job market. The women left their homes for the factories in record numbers.[36] By 1953, Puerto Rican migration to New York reached its peak when 75,000 people left the island.[9]\\r\\nOperation Bootstrap (\\"Operaci܇n Manos a la Obra\\") is the name given to the ambitious projects which industrialized Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century engineered by Teodoro Moscoso. The industry that was attracted did not provide sufficient jobs. With increased population growth and displacement from traditional labor pursuits, the growing population could not be accommodated. Much of the surplus labor migrated to the United States. In 1948, Puerto Ricans elected their first governor Luis Mu?oz Marn, who together with his government initiated a series of social and economic reforms with the introduction of new programs in the island. Some of these programs met some resistance from the American government and therefore, the local government had some trouble implementing the same.[37] New York Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. began a campaign to recruit Puerto Rican laborers in the island to work in the city's factories. Mayor Wagner figured that the city would benefit greatly by the luring of what was considered to be \\"cheap labor\\".[9]\\r\\nDiscrimination was rampant in the United States and it was no different in New York. As stated by Lolita Lebr܇n, there were signs in restaurants which read \\"No dogs or Puerto Ricans allowed\\". The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party established an office in New York in the 1950s and attracted many migrants. Leaders of the party conceived a plan that would involve an attack on the Blair House with the intention of assassinating United States President Harry S. Truman and an attack on the House of Representatives. These events had a negative impact on the Puerto Rican migrants. Americans viewed Puerto Ricans as anti-Americans and the discrimination against them became even more widespread.[38]\\r\\nMany Puerto Ricans were able to overcome these obstacles and became respected members of their communities. Many such as Antonia Pantoja, established organizations such as \\"ASPIRA\\", that helped their fellow countrymen to reach their goals.[39]\\r\\nIn 1954, a group of politicians close to Carmine Gerard DeSapio, then the leader of Tammany Hall, chose Tony Mndez to lead the eastern section of the district, known as the 14th Assembly District. He was chosen by the group, which was also known as the Democratic County Committee, because in those days there was no direct election of district leaders. Plus, the influx of Puerto Ricans moving to the 14th Assembly District, in which East Harlem is located, replaced the members of the Italian Community who preceded them and eventually moved out. Mndez became the first native-born Puerto Rican to become a district leader of a major political party in New York City.[40]\\r\\nThe first New York Puerto Rican Day Parade, founded by Tony Mndez was held on Sunday, April 13, 1958 in the \\"Barrio\\" in Manhattan.[40] Its first President was Victor L܇pez and it was coordinated by Jos Caballero. The grand marshals were Oscar Gonzlez Suarez and Tony Mndez Esq. Prominent personalities from Puerto Rico headed by then Governor Luis Mu?oz Marn, attended the initial parade. The parade was organized as a show of Puerto Rican pride and is a tradition which not only continues today in the city of New York but, that has also extended to other cities such as Chicago, Illinois and Orlando, Florida.[41] By 1960, the United States census showed that there were well over 600,000 New Yorkers of Puerto Rican birth or parentage. Estimates were that more than one million Puerto Ricans had migrated during that period.[9]\\r\\nPuerto Rican writer Jes~s Col܇n founded an intellectual movement involving poets, writers, musicians and artists who are Puerto Rican or of Puerto Rican descent and who live in or near New York City which became known as the Nuyorican Movement. The phenomenon of the \\"Nuyoricans\\" came about when many Puerto Ricans who migrated to New York City faced difficult situations and hardships, such as racial discrimination. A \\"Nuyorican\\" subculture developed. In 1980, Puerto Rican poets Miguel Algarn, Miguel Pi?ero and Pedro Pietri established the \\"Nuyorican Poets Caf\\" on Manhattan's Lower East Side (236 E 3rd Street, between Avenues B and C) which is now considered a New York landmark.[42]\\r\\nBy 1964, the Puerto Rican community made up 9.3 percent of the total New York City's population. The Puerto Rican migrants who gained economic success began to move away from the \\"Barrios\\" and settled in Westchester County, Staten Island, and Long Island or moved to other cities in other states like New Jersey (especially North Jersey which is still apart of the NYC metropolitan area), Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Florida, among others.[45] New immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Mexico and South America moved into the Barrios which were once mainly occupied by the Puerto Ricans.[46] The 1970s saw what became known as reverse-migration. Many Puerto Ricans returned to the island to buy homes and to invest in local businesses. Puerto Ricans have made many important contributions to New York and the society of the United States in general. They have contributed in the fields of entertainment, the arts, music, industry, science, politics, and military.[47] Other Puerto Ricans have moved from New York to settle in smaller cities throughout the northeastern United States. For example, in 2009 Puerto Ricans alone made up 29.1% of Reading, Pennsylvania's population,[48] which was over 53% Hispanic, and 25.0% of Lawrence, Massachusetts' population, which was over 70% Hispanic.[49]\\r\\nHowever, since 2006, there has been a resurgence in immigration from Puerto Rico to New York City[50] and New Jersey, with an apparently multifactorial allure to Puerto Ricans, primarily for economic and cultural considerations. The Census estimate for the New York City, the city proper with the largest Puerto Rican population by a significant margin, has increased from 723,621 in 2010, to 730,848 in 2012;[51] while New York State's Puerto Rican population was estimated to have increased from 1,070,558 in 2010, to 1,103,067 in 2013.[52]\\r\\nNew York State overall has also resumed its net in-migration of Puerto Rican Americans since 2006, a dramatic reversal from being the only state to register a decrease in its Puerto Rican population between 1990 and 2000. The Puerto Rican population of New York State, still the largest in the United States, is estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau to have increased from 1,070,558 in 2010 to 1,103,067 in 2013. New York State gained more Puerto Rican migrants from Puerto Rico as well as from elsewhere on the mainland between 2006 and 2012 than any other state in absolute numbers.[53] Also, unlike the initial pattern of migration several decades ago, this second Puerto Rican migration into New York and surrounding states is being driven by movement not only into New York City proper, but also into the city's surrounding suburban areas, such that the New York City Metropolitan Area gained the highest number of additional Puerto Rican Americans of any metropolitan area between 2010 and 2016, to 1,494,670 in 2016.[7]\\r\\nNorthern New Jersey has also received a robust influx of Puerto Rican migration in the 21st century,[54][55] given its proximity to both New York City's and Philadelphia's Puerto Rican establishments. Within the metropolitan area surrounding New York City, Paterson[56] and Newark[57] in New Jersey are important homes for Puerto Rican Americans. Jose \\"Joey\\" Torres was elected mayor of Paterson in 2014, where he had served two prior terms as mayor as well;[58][59] while Luis A. Quintana, born in A?asco, Puerto Rico, was sworn in as Newark's first Latino mayor in November 2013, assuming the unexpired term of Cory Booker, who vacated the position to become a U.S. Senator from New Jersey.[60] However, as Puerto Ricans continue to climb the socioeconomic ladder and achieve a greater degree of professional occupations, the community is also purchasing homes in New Jersey's more affluent suburban towns. After Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in September 2017, devastating the infrastructure of the island, New York State was expected to be the likeliest destination for Puerto Rican migrants to the U.S. mainland when premised upon family ties, with New Jersey being the third likeliest destination.[61]\\r\\nBrooklyn has several neighborhoods with a Puerto Rican presence, and many of the ethnic Puerto Rican neighborhoods in Brooklyn formed before the Puerto Rican neighborhoods in the South Bronx because of the work demand in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in the 1940s and 50s. Bushwick has the highest concentration of Puerto Ricans in Brooklyn. Other neighborhoods with significant populations include Williamsburg, East New York, Brownsville, Coney Island, Red Hook, and Sunset Park.[62][63][64][65] In Williamsburg; Graham Avenue is nicknamed \\"Avenue of Puerto Rico\\" because of the high density and strong ethnic enclave of Puerto Ricans who have been living in the neighborhood since the 1950s. The Puerto Rican Day Parade is also hosted on the avenue.\\r\\nRidgewood, Queens, also has a significant Puerto Rican population, as does the neighboring community of Bushwick, Brooklyn.[66]\\r\\nPuerto Rican neighborhoods in Manhattan include Spanish Harlem and Loisaida.[67][68] Spanish Harlem was \\"Italian Harlem\\" from the 1880s until the 1940s.[67] By 1940, however, the name \\"Spanish Harlem\\" was becoming widespread, and by 1950, the area was predominately Puerto Rican and African American.[67] Loisaida is an enclave east of Avenue A that originally comprised German, Jewish, Irish, and Italian working class residents who lived in tenements without running water; the German presence, already in decline, virtually ended after the General Slocum disaster in 1904. Since them, the community has become Puerto Rican and Latino in character, despite the \\"gentrification\\" that has affected the East Village and the Lower East Side since the late 20th century.[68]\\r\\nStaten Island has a fairly large Puerto Rican population along the North Shore, especially in the Mariners' Harbor, Arlington, Elm Park, Graniteville, Port Richmond, and Stapleton neighborhoods, where the population is in the 20% range.\\r\\nIn New York and many other cities, Puerto Ricans usually live in close proximity with Dominicans and African Americans.[69] High concentrations of Puerto Ricans are also present in numerous public housing developments throughout the city.[69]\\r\\nPuerto Ricans are present in large numbers throughout the Bronx, the Bronx has the highest percentage of Puerto Ricans of any borough.[4] In some places in the South Bronx, Spanish is the primary language.[70] Throughout the 1970s, the South Bronx became known as the epitome of urban decay, but has since made a recovery.[71]\\r\\nAs of 1990, New Yorkers of Puerto Rican descent (Nuyoricans), numbered 143,974. Nearly 41,800 state residents (Nuyoricans) in 1990 had lived in Puerto Rico in 1985. According to the Census taken in the year 2000, Puerto Rican migrants made up 1.2% of the total population of the United States, with a population of well over 3 million Puerto Ricans (including those of Puerto Rican descent). If taken into account together with the almost 4 million Puerto Ricans who are U.S. citizens (nevertheless, excluded by the U.S. Census statistics of U.S. population), Puerto Ricans make up about 2.5% of the total population of U.S. citizens around the world (within and outside the U.S. mainland).[72]\\r\\nNew York City's total Puerto Rican population was 723,621 and they represented 8.9% of the population. The Puerto Rican population and the percentage Puerto Ricans make up of each borough, as of the 2010 census, is:[4]\\r\\nIn July 1930, Puerto Rico's Department of Labor established an employment service in New York City.[73] The Migration Division (known as the \\"Commonwealth Office\\"), also part of Puerto Rico's Department of Labor, was created in 1948, and by the end of the 1950s, was operating in 115 cities and towns stateside.[74] The Department of Puerto Rican Affairs in the United States was established in 1989 as a cabinet-level department in Puerto Rico. Currently, the Commonwealth operates the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and has 12 regional offices throughout the United States.\\r\\nPuerto Ricans in New York have preserved their cultural heritage by being involved actively in the different political and social rights movements in the United States. They founded \\"Aspira\\", a leader in the field of education, in 1961. Aspira is now one of the largest national Latino nonprofit organizations in the United States.[75] Other educational and social organizations founded by Puerto Ricans in New York and else where are the National Puerto Rican Coalition in Washington, DC, the National Puerto Rican Forum, the Puerto Rican Family Institute, Boricua College, the Center for Puerto Rican Studies of the City University of New York at Hunter College, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women, and the New York League of Puerto Rican Women, Inc., among others.\\r\\nHostos Community College in the Bronx, was named after a Puerto Rican Eugenio Maria de Hostos, and was founded as an all-Puerto Rican college. The college now accepts students of all races, however it largely caters to Hispanics with up to 80% of its students being of Hispanic descent.[76] Boricua College is another originally all-Puerto Rican college with campuses in East Williamsburg and Manhattan.\\r\\nCultural ties between New York and Puerto Rico are strong. In September 2017, following the immense destruction wrought upon Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo led an aid delegation to San Juan,[77] including engineers form the New York Power Authority to help restore Puerto Rico's electrical grid.[78]","field3":"When did puerto rican immigrants come to america?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"China","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"This is a list of countries by gold production in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years until 2006, South Africa was the world's dominant gold producer, but recently other countries have surpassed South Africa: China, Russia, Canada, the United States, Peru and Australia.

It has a distinctive physical appearance and valuable hunting skills. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America, specifically \\"native\\" to the state of Maine (though the feline was simply introduced there),[3] where it is the official state cat.\\r\\nNo records of the Maine Coon's exact origins and date of introduction to the United States exist, so several competing hypotheses have been suggested. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since made a comeback and is now one of the more popular cat breeds in the world.\\r\\nThe Maine Coon is a large and sociable cat, hence its nickname, \\"the gentle giant.\\" It is characterized by a prominent ruff along its chest, robust bone structure, triangular body shape, an uneven two layered coat with longer guard hairs with a silky satin under layer undercoat, and a long, bushy tail. The breed's colors vary widely, with only lilac and chocolate disallowed for pedigree. Reputed for its intelligence and playful, gentle personality, the Maine Coon is often cited as having \\"dog-like\\" characteristics.[4][5] Professionals notice certain health problems in the breed including feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hip dysplasia, but reputable breeders use modern screening methods to minimize the frequency of these problems.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancestral origins of the Maine Coon are unknown[6]  there are only speculation and folk tales. One such folk tale involves Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, who was executed in 1793. The story goes that before her death, Antoinette attempted to escape France with the help of Captain Samuel Clough. She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora cats. Although she did not make it to the United States, her pets safely reached the shores of Wiscasset, Maine, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon.[7]\\r\\nAnother folk tale involves Captain Charles Coon, an English seafarer who kept long-haired cats aboard his ships. Whenever Coon's ship would anchor in New England ports, the felines would exit the ship and mate with the local feral cat population. When long-haired kittens began appearing in the litters of the local cat population, they were referred to as one of \\"Coon's cats\\".[8]\\r\\nA myth which is trait-based, though genetically impossible,[9] is the idea that the modern Maine Coon descended from ancestors of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail.[10] Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.[8]\\r\\nThe generally accepted hypothesis among breeders is that the Maine Coon is descended from the pairings of local short-haired domestic cats and long-haired breeds brought overseas by English seafarers (possibly by Captain Charles Coon) or 11th-century Norsemen.[10][11] The connection to the Norsemen is seen in the strong resemblance of the Maine Coon to the Norwegian Forest Cat, another breed that is said to be a descendant of cats that traveled with the Norsemen.[12][13]\\r\\nThe first mention of Maine Coons in a literary work was in 1861, in Frances Simpson's The Book of the Cat (1903). F.R. Pierce, who owned several Maine Coons, wrote a chapter about the breed.[14] During the late 1860s, farmers located in Maine told stories about their cats and held the \\"Maine State Champion Coon Cat\\" contest at the local Skowhegan Fair.[8]\\r\\nIn 1895, a dozen Maine Coons were entered into a show in Boston. On 8 May 1895, the first North American cat show was hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City. A female Maine Coon brown tabby, named Cosey, was entered into the show. Owned by Mrs. Fred Brown, Cosey won the silver collar and medal and was named Best in Show.[15] The silver collar was purchased by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Foundation with the help of a donation from the National Capital Cat Show. The collar is housed at the CFA Central Office in the Jean Baker Rose Memorial Library.[8]\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, the Maine Coon's popularity began to decline with the introduction of other long-haired breeds, such as the Persian, which originated in the Middle East. The last recorded win by a Maine Coon in a national cat show for over 40 years was in 1911 at a show in Portland, Oregon. The breed was rarely seen after that. The decline was so severe that the breed was declared extinct in the 1950s, although this declaration was considered to be exaggerated and reported prematurely at the time. The Central Maine Cat Club (CMCC) was created in the early 1950s by Alta Smith and Ruby Dyer in attempts to increase the popularity of the Maine Coon. For 11 years, the CMCC held cat shows and hosted exhibitions of photographs of the breed and is noted for creating the first written breed standards for the Maine Coon.[8]\\r\\nThe Maine Coon was denied provisional breed statusone of the three steps required for a breed not yet recognized by the CFA to be able to compete in championship competitions[16]by the CFA three times, which led to the formation of the Maine Coon Cat Club in 1973. The breed was finally accepted by the CFA under provisional status on 1 May 1975, and was approved for championship status on 1 May 1976. The next couple of decades saw a rise in popularity of the Maine Coon, with championship victories and an increase in national rankings. In 1985, the state of Maine announced that the breed would be named the official State Cat.[17] Today the Maine Coon is the third most popular cat breed, according to the number of kittens registered with the CFA.[18]\\r\\nThe Maine Coon is the largest breed of domestic cat. On average, males weigh from 13 to 18?lb (5.9 to 8.2?kg) with females weighing from 8 to 12?lb (3.6 to 5.4?kg).[19] The height of adults can vary between 10 and 16?in (25 and 41?cm) and they can reach a length of up to 48?in (120?cm), including the tail, which can reach a length of 14?in (36?cm)[20] and is long, tapering, and heavily furred, almost resembling a raccoon's tail. The body is solid and muscular, which is necessary for supporting their own weight, and the chest is broad. Maine Coons possess a rectangular body shape and are slow to physically mature; their full potential size is normally not reached until they are three to five years old, while other cats take about one year.[21]\\r\\nIn 2010, the Guinness World Records accepted a male purebred Maine Coon named \\"Stewie\\" as the \\"Longest Cat\\" measuring 48.5?in (123?cm) from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail. Stewie died 4 February 2013, from cancer at his home in Reno, Nevada, at age 8.[22][23] As of 2015 the living record-holder for \\"Longest Cat\\" is \\"Ludo\\", measuring 3?ft 10.59 in (118.33?cm). He lives in Wakefield, UK.[24] Large Maine Coons can overlap in length with Eurasian lynxes, although with a much lighter build and lower height.[25]\\r\\nThe Maine Coon is a long or medium haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, although texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter on the head and shoulders, and longer on the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation,[26] with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.\\r\\nMaine Coons can have any colors that other cats have. Colors indicating crossbreeding, such as chocolate, lavender, the Siamese pointed patterns or the \\"ticked\\" patterns, are not accepted by some breed standards (the 'ticked' pattern, for example, is accepted by TICA).[8] The most common pattern seen in the breed is brown tabby.[27] All eye colors are accepted under breed standards, with the exception of the occurrence of blue-colored or odd-eyes (i.e. two eyes of different colors) in cats possessing coat colors other than white.[26]\\r\\nMaine Coons have several physical adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection when they are walking or sitting on top of wet surfaces of snow or ice.[28] Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface.[29] Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons,[30] facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes.[28] Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight.[29] Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.[28]\\r\\nMany of the original Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on the feet).[28] While some sources claim that trait is thought to have occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time, little evidence has been given to substantiate this claim.[31] Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards.[32] The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene,[33] which has shown to pose no threat to the cat's health.[34] The trait was almost eradicated from the breed due to the fact that it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings.[35] Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing.\\r\\nMaine Coons are known as the \\"gentle giants\\"[5] and possess above-average intelligence, making them relatively easy to train.[4] They are known for being loyal to their family and cautiousbut not meanaround strangers, but are independent and not clingy. The Maine Coon is generally not known for being a \\"lap cat\\" but their gentle disposition makes the breed relaxed around dogs, other cats, and children. They are playful throughout their lives, with males tending to be more clownish and females generally possessing more dignity, yet both are equally affectionate.[28] Many Maine Coons have a fascination with water and some theorize that this personality trait comes from their ancestors, who were aboard ships for much of their lives.[6] Maine Coons are also well known for being very vocal cats. They are known for their frequent yowling or howling, trilling, chirping, and making other loud vocalizations.[36]\\r\\nA sitting Maine Coon\\r\\nFemale Maine Coon brown tabby, age?6.\\r\\nA Maine Coon kitten at three days old\\r\\nCream shaded Maine Coon\\r\\nMaine Coon silver tabby\\r\\nMaine Coon kitten at 75 days old\\r\\nMaine Coons[37] require ample protein and nutrients in their diets. Since they are a large cat breed with high levels of energy, it is best to feed them quality food. Food that lists meat as the first ingredient is best for the Maine Coon.[38]\\r\\nPet insurance data obtained from a study during years 2003ÿ2006 in Sweden puts the median lifespan of the Maine Coon at >12.5 years. 74% lived to 10 years or more and 54% lived to 12.5 years or more.[39] Maine Coons are generally a healthy and hardy breed and have adapted to survive the New England climate. The most severe threat is feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common heart disease seen in cats, whether pure bred or not. In Maine Coons, it is thought to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Middle-aged to older cats as well as males are thought to be predisposed to the disease.[40] HCM is a progressive disease and can result in heart failure, paralysis of the hind legs due to clot embolization originating in the heart, and sudden death.[41] A specific mutation that causes HCM is seen in Maine Coons for which testing services are offered.[42] Of all the Maine Coons tested for the MyBPC mutation at the Veterinary Cardiac Genetics Lab at the College of Veterinary Medicine located at Washington State University, approximately one-third tested positive.[43] Not all cats that tested positive will have clinical signs of the disease and some Maine Coon cats with clinical evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy test negative for this mutation, strongly suggesting that a second mutation exists in the breed. The HCM prevalence was found to be 10.1% (95% CI 5.8 -14.3% ) in this study.[44]\\r\\nAnother potential health problem is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes the loss of the spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3ÿ4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.[45]\\r\\nHip dysplasia is an abnormality of the hip joint which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced.[46] X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed in the database.[47]\\r\\nPolycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a slowly progressive disease affecting Persian and Persian-related breeds, in which fluid-filled cysts expand within the kidneys, destroying functional tissue. While renal cysts are observed with a low incidence in Maine Coons, PKD appears to be a misnomer in this particular breed. In a recent study[48] spanning 8 years, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons enrolled in a pre-breeding screening programme. The cysts were mostly single and unilateral (6/7, 85.7%) small (mean 3.6?mm in diameter) and located at corticomedullary junction (4/6, 66.7%), thus different in size, numbers and location from those observed in Persian-related breeds. In the same study, not only did all six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts test negative for the PKD1 mutation, proving the disease in these cats to be unrelated to the PKD observed in Persians and related breeds, but gene sequencing of these cats failed to demonstrate any common genetic sequences. The presence of renal cysts, in the absence of other changes, does not appear to negatively impact the patients' quality of life, as those for which follow-up was available were reported alive and well in adulthood. Although the exact nature and clinical relevance of renal cysts in Maine Coons is currently unknown, its screening is still recommended for pre-breeding assessment. Ultrasonography is currently the only valid diagnostic method for its detection in this breed.","field3":"How long does it take for a maine coon cat to be fully grown?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"electrons, the charge carriers in metal wires and most other parts of electric circuits, flow in the opposite direction of conventional current flow in an electrical circuit","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"An electric current is a flow of electric charge.[1]:2 In electric circuits this charge is often carried by moving electrons in a wire. It can also be carried by ions in an electrolyte, or by both ions and electrons such as in an ionised gas (plasma).[2]\\r\\nThe SI unit for measuring an electric current is the ampere, which is the flow of electric charge across a surface at the rate of one coulomb per second. Electric current is measured using a device called an ammeter.[3]\\r\\nElectric currents cause Joule heating, which creates light in incandescent light bulbs. They also create magnetic fields, which are used in motors, inductors and generators.\\r\\nThe moving charged particles in an electric current are called charge carriers. In metals, one or more electrons from each atom are loosely bound to the atom, and can move freely about within the metal. These conduction electrons are the charge carriers in metal conductors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conventional symbol for current is I, which originates from the French phrase intensit de courant, (current intensity).[4][5] Current intensity is often referred to simply as current.[6] The I symbol was used by Andr-Marie Ampre, after whom the unit of electric current is named, in formulating Ampre's force law (1820).[7] The notation travelled from France to Great Britain, where it became standard, although at least one journal did not change from using C to I until 1896.[8]\\r\\nIn a conductive material, the moving charged particles which constitute the electric current are called charge carriers. In metals, which make up the wires and other conductors in most electrical circuits, the positively charged atomic nuclei are held in a fixed position, and the negatively charged electrons are free to move, carrying their charge from one place to another. In other materials, notably the semiconductors, the charge carriers can be positive or negative, depending on the dopant used. Positive and negative charge carriers may even be present at the same time, as happens in an electrolyte in an electrochemical cell.\\r\\nA flow of positive charges gives the same electric current, and has the same effect in a circuit, as an equal flow of negative charges in the opposite direction. Since current can be the flow of either positive or negative charges, or both, a convention is needed for the direction of current that is independent of the type of charge carriers. The direction of conventional current is arbitrarily defined as the same direction as positive charges flow.\\r\\nThe consequence of this convention is that electrons, the charge carriers in metal wires and most other parts of electric circuits, flow in the opposite direction of conventional current flow in an electrical circuit.\\r\\nSince the current in a wire or component can flow in either direction, when a variable I is defined to represent that current, the direction representing positive current must be specified, usually by an arrow on the circuit schematic diagram. This is called the reference direction of current I. If the current flows in the opposite direction, the variable I has a negative value.\\r\\nWhen analyzing electrical circuits, the actual direction of current through a specific circuit element is usually unknown. Consequently, the reference directions of currents are often assigned arbitrarily. When the circuit is solved, a negative value for the variable means that the actual direction of current through that circuit element is opposite that of the chosen reference direction. In electronic circuits, the reference current directions are often chosen so that all currents are toward ground. This often corresponds to the actual current direction, because in many circuits the power supply voltage is positive with respect to ground.\\r\\nOhm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance,[9] one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship:[10]\\r\\nwhere I is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, V is the potential difference measured across the conductor in units of volts, and R is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms. More specifically, Ohm's law states that the R in this relation is constant, independent of the current.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn alternating current (AC) systems, the movement of electric charge periodically reverses direction. AC is the form of electric power most commonly delivered to businesses and residences. The usual waveform of an AC power circuit is a sine wave. Certain applications use different waveforms, such as triangular or square waves. Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. An important goal in these applications is recovery of information encoded (or modulated) onto the AC signal.\\r\\nIn contrast, direct current (DC) is the unidirectional flow of electric charge, or a system in which the movement of electric charge is in one direction only. Direct current is produced by sources such as batteries, thermocouples, solar cells, and commutator-type electric machines of the dynamo type. Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. An old name for direct current was galvanic current.[12]\\r\\nNatural observable examples of electrical current include lightning, static electric discharge, and the solar wind, the source of the polar auroras.\\r\\nMan-made occurrences of electric current include the flow of conduction electrons in metal wires such as the overhead power lines that deliver electrical energy across long distances and the smaller wires within electrical and electronic equipment. Eddy currents are electric currents that occur in conductors exposed to changing magnetic fields. Similarly, electric currents occur, particularly in the surface, of conductors exposed to electromagnetic waves. When oscillating electric currents flow at the correct voltages within radio antennas, radio waves are generated.\\r\\nIn electronics, other forms of electric current include the flow of electrons through resistors or through the vacuum in a vacuum tube, the flow of ions inside a battery or a neuron, and the flow of holes within a semiconductor.\\r\\nCurrent can be measured using an ammeter.\\r\\nAt the circuit level, there are various techniques that can be used to measure current:\\r\\nJoule heating, also known as ohmic heating and resistive heating, is the process by which the passage of an electric current through a conductor releases heat. It was first studied by James Prescott Joule in 1841. Joule immersed a length of wire in a fixed mass of water and measured the temperature rise due to a known current through the wire for a 30 minute period. By varying the current and the length of the wire he deduced that the heat produced was proportional to the square of the current multiplied by the electrical resistance of the wire.\\r\\nThis relationship is known as Joule's First Law. The SI unit of energy was subsequently named the joule and given the symbol J. The commonly known unit of power, the watt, is equivalent to one joule per second.\\r\\nIn an electromagnet a coil, of a large number of circular turns of insulated wire, wrapped on a cylindrical core, behaves like a magnet when an electric current flows through it. When the current is switched off, the coil loses its magnetism immediately. We call such a device as an electromagnet.[15][16]\\r\\nElectric current produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field can be visualized as a pattern of circular field lines surrounding the wire that persists as long as there is current.\\r\\nMagnetism can also produce electric currents. When a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, an Electromotive force (EMF) is produced, and when there is a suitable path, this causes current.\\r\\nElectric current can be directly measured with a galvanometer, but this method involves breaking the electrical circuit, which is sometimes inconvenient. Current can also be measured without breaking the circuit by detecting the magnetic field associated with the current. Devices used for this include Hall effect sensors, current clamps, current transformers, and Rogowski coils.\\r\\nWhen an electric current flows in a suitably shaped conductor at radio frequencies radio waves can be generated. These travel at the speed of light and can cause electric currents in distant conductors.\\r\\nIn metallic solids, electric charge flows by means of electrons, from lower to higher electrical potential. In other media, any stream of charged objects (ions, for example) may constitute an electric current. To provide a definition of current independent of the type of charge carriers, conventional current is defined as moving in the same direction as the positive charge flow. So, in metals where the charge carriers (electrons) are negative, conventional current is in the opposite direction as the electrons. In conductors where the charge carriers are positive, conventional current is in the same direction as the charge carriers.\\r\\nIn a vacuum, a beam of ions or electrons may be formed. In other conductive materials, the electric current is due to the flow of both positively and negatively charged particles at the same time. In still others, the current is entirely due to positive charge flow. For example, the electric currents in electrolytes are flows of positively and negatively charged ions. In a common lead-acid electrochemical cell, electric currents are composed of positive hydrogen ions (protons) flowing in one direction, and negative sulfate ions flowing in the other. Electric currents in sparks or plasma are flows of electrons as well as positive and negative ions. In ice and in certain solid electrolytes, the electric current is entirely composed of flowing ions.\\r\\nIn a metal, some of the outer electrons in each atom are not bound to the individual atom as they are in insulating materials, but are free to move within the metal lattice. These conduction electrons can serve as charge carriers, carrying a current. Metals are particularly conductive because there are a large number of these free electrons, typically one per atom in the lattice. With no external electric field applied, these electrons move about randomly due to thermal energy but, on average, there is zero net current within the metal. At room temperature, the average speed of these random motions is 106 metres per second.[17] Given a surface through which a metal wire passes, electrons move in both directions across the surface at an equal rate. As George Gamow wrote in his popular science book, One, Two, Three...Infinity (1947), \\"The metallic substances differ from all other materials by the fact that the outer shells of their atoms are bound rather loosely, and often let one of their electrons go free. Thus the interior of a metal is filled up with a large number of unattached electrons that travel aimlessly around like a crowd of displaced persons. When a metal wire is subjected to electric force applied on its opposite ends, these free electrons rush in the direction of the force, thus forming what we call an electric current.\\"\\r\\nWhen a metal wire is connected across the two terminals of a DC voltage source such as a battery, the source places an electric field across the conductor. The moment contact is made, the free electrons of the conductor are forced to drift toward the positive terminal under the influence of this field. The free electrons are therefore the charge carrier in a typical solid conductor.\\r\\nFor a steady flow of charge through a surface, the current I (in amperes) can be calculated with the following equation:\\r\\nwhere Q is the electric charge transferred through the surface over a time t. If Q and t are measured in coulombs and seconds respectively, I is in amperes.\\r\\nMore generally, electric current can be represented as the rate at which charge flows through a given surface as:\\r\\nElectric currents in electrolytes are flows of electrically charged particles (ions). For example, if an electric field is placed across a solution of Na+ and Cl? (and conditions are right) the sodium ions move towards the negative electrode (cathode), while the chloride ions move towards the positive electrode (anode). Reactions take place at both electrode surfaces, absorbing each ion.\\r\\nWater-ice and certain solid electrolytes called proton conductors contain positive hydrogen ions (\\"protons\\") that are mobile. In these materials, electric currents are composed of moving protons, as opposed to the moving electrons in metals.\\r\\nIn certain electrolyte mixtures, brightly coloured ions are the moving electric charges. The slow progress of the colour makes the current visible.[18]\\r\\nIn air and other ordinary gases below the breakdown field, the dominant source of electrical conduction is via relatively few mobile ions produced by radioactive gases, ultraviolet light, or cosmic rays. Since the electrical conductivity is low, gases are dielectrics or insulators. However, once the applied electric field approaches the breakdown value, free electrons become sufficiently accelerated by the electric field to create additional free electrons by colliding, and ionizing, neutral gas atoms or molecules in a process called avalanche breakdown. The breakdown process forms a plasma that contains enough mobile electrons and positive ions to make it an electrical conductor. In the process, it forms a light emitting conductive path, such as a spark, arc or lightning.\\r\\nPlasma is the state of matter where some of the electrons in a gas are stripped or \\"ionized\\" from their molecules or atoms. A plasma can be formed by high temperature, or by application of a high electric or alternating magnetic field as noted above. Due to their lower mass, the electrons in a plasma accelerate more quickly in response to an electric field than the heavier positive ions, and hence carry the bulk of the current. The free ions recombine to create new chemical compounds (for example, breaking atmospheric oxygen into single oxygen [O2 L 2O], which then recombine creating ozone [O3]).[19]\\r\\nSince a \\"perfect vacuum\\" contains no charged particles, it normally behaves as a perfect insulator. However, metal electrode surfaces can cause a region of the vacuum to become conductive by injecting free electrons or ions through either field electron emission or thermionic emission. Thermionic emission occurs when the thermal energy exceeds the metal's work function, while field electron emission occurs when the electric field at the surface of the metal is high enough to cause tunneling, which results in the ejection of free electrons from the metal into the vacuum. Externally heated electrodes are often used to generate an electron cloud as in the filament or indirectly heated cathode of vacuum tubes. Cold electrodes can also spontaneously produce electron clouds via thermionic emission when small incandescent regions (called cathode spots or anode spots) are formed. These are incandescent regions of the electrode surface that are created by a localized high current. These regions may be initiated by field electron emission, but are then sustained by localized thermionic emission once a vacuum arc forms. These small electron-emitting regions can form quite rapidly, even explosively, on a metal surface subjected to a high electrical field. Vacuum tubes and sprytrons are some of the electronic switching and amplifying devices based on vacuum conductivity.\\r\\nSuperconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields occurring in certain materials when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature. It was discovered by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April?8, 1911 in Leiden. Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics.\\r\\nIn a semiconductor it is sometimes useful to think of the current as due to the flow of positive \\"holes\\" (the mobile positive charge carriers that are places where the semiconductor crystal is missing a valence electron). This is the case in a p-type semiconductor. A semiconductor has electrical conductivity intermediate in magnitude between that of a conductor and an insulator. This means a conductivity roughly in the range of 10?2 to 104 siemens per centimeter (S?cm?1).\\r\\nIn the classic crystalline semiconductors, electrons can have energies only within certain bands (i.e. ranges of levels of energy). Energetically, these bands are located between the energy of the ground state, the state in which electrons are tightly bound to the atomic nuclei of the material, and the free electron energy, the latter describing the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material. The energy bands each correspond to a large number of discrete quantum states of the electrons, and most of the states with low energy (closer to the nucleus) are occupied, up to a particular band called the valence band. Semiconductors and insulators are distinguished from metals because the valence band in any given metal is nearly filled with electrons under usual operating conditions, while very few (semiconductor) or virtually none (insulator) of them are available in the conduction band, the band immediately above the valence band.\\r\\nThe ease of exciting electrons in the semiconductor from the valence band to the conduction band depends on the band gap between the bands. The size of this energy band gap serves as an arbitrary dividing line (roughly 4 eV) between semiconductors and insulators.\\r\\nWith covalent bonds, an electron moves by hopping to a neighboring bond. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that the electron be lifted into the higher anti-bonding state of that bond. For delocalized states, for example in one dimension ÿ that is in a nanowire, for every energy there is a state with electrons flowing in one direction and another state with the electrons flowing in the other. For a net current to flow, more states for one direction than for the other direction must be occupied. For this to occur, energy is required, as in the semiconductor the next higher states lie above the band gap. Often this is stated as: full bands do not contribute to the electrical conductivity. However, as a semiconductor's temperature rises above absolute zero, there is more energy in the semiconductor to spend on lattice vibration and on exciting electrons into the conduction band. The current-carrying electrons in the conduction band are known as free electrons, though they are often simply called electrons if that is clear in context.\\r\\nCurrent density is a measure of the density of an electric current. It is defined as a vector whose magnitude is the electric current per cross-sectional area. In SI units, the current density is measured in amperes per square metre.\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle I}\\r\\n\\r\\n is current in the conductor, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJ\\r\\nL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\vec {J}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the current density, and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA\\r\\nL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle d{\\\\vec {A}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the differential cross-sectional area vector.\\r\\nThe current density (current per unit area) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJ\\r\\nL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\vec {J}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n in materials with finite resistance is directly proportional to the electric field \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nE\\r\\nL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\vec {E}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n in the medium.

In such conditions, Ohm's law states that the current is directly proportional to the potential difference between two ends (across) of that metal (ideal) resistor (or other ohmic device):\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle I}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the current, measured in amperes; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle V}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the potential difference, measured in volts; and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle R}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the resistance, measured in ohms. For alternating currents, especially at higher frequencies, skin effect causes the current to spread unevenly across the conductor cross-section, with higher density near the surface, thus increasing the apparent resistance.\\r\\nThe mobile charged particles within a conductor move constantly in random directions, like the particles of a gas. (More accurately, a Fermi gas.) To create a net flow of charge, the particles must also move together with an average drift rate. Electrons are the charge carriers in metals and they follow an erratic path, bouncing from atom to atom, but generally drifting in the opposite direction of the electric field. The speed they drift at can be calculated from the equation:\\r\\nwhere\\r\\nTypically, electric charges in solids flow slowly. For example, in a copper wire of cross-section 0.5?mm2, carrying a current of 5?A, the drift velocity of the electrons is on the order of a millimetre per second. To take a different example, in the near-vacuum inside a cathode ray tube, the electrons travel in near-straight lines at about a tenth of the speed of light.\\r\\nAny accelerating electric charge, and therefore any changing electric current, gives rise to an electromagnetic wave that propagates at very high speed outside the surface of the conductor. This speed is usually a significant fraction of the speed of light, as can be deduced from Maxwell's Equations, and is therefore many times faster than the drift velocity of the electrons. For example, in AC power lines, the waves of electromagnetic energy propagate through the space between the wires, moving from a source to a distant load, even though the electrons in the wires only move back and forth over a tiny distance.\\r\\nThe ratio of the speed of the electromagnetic wave to the speed of light in free space is called the velocity factor, and depends on the electromagnetic properties of the conductor and the insulating materials surrounding it, and on their shape and size.\\r\\nThe magnitudes (not the natures) of these three velocities can be illustrated by an analogy with the three similar velocities associated with gases. (See also hydraulic analogy.)","field3":"What is the actual direction of electric current?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"31 March 2011","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The 15th Indian Census was conducted in two phases, house listing and population enumeration.

The second population enumeration phase was conducted between 9 and 28 February 2011. Census has been conducted in India since 1872 and 2011 marks the first time biometric information was collected. According to the provisional reports released on 31 March 2011, the Indian population increased to 121 crore with a decadal growth of 17.64%.[2] Adult literacy rate increased to 74.04% with a decadal growth of 9.21%. The motto of census 2011 was 'Our Census, Our future'.\\r\\nSpread across 28 states[a] and 7 union territories, the census covered 640 districts, 5,924 sub-districts, 7,935 towns and more than 6 lakh villages. A total of 27 lakh officials visited households in 7,935 towns and 6 lakh villages, classifying the population according to gender, religion, education and occupation.[3] The cost of the exercise was approximately ?2,200 crore (US$340?million)[4] ÿ this comes to less than $0.50 per person, well below the estimated world average of $4.60 per person.[3] Conducted every 10 years, this census faced big challenges considering India's vast area and diversity of cultures and opposition from the manpower involved.\\r\\nInformation on castes was included in the census following demands from several ruling coalition leaders including Lalu Prasad Yadav, Sharad Yadav and SP suprimo Mulayam Singh Yadav supported by opposition parties Bharatiya Janata Party, Akali Dal, Shiv Sena and Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.[5] Information on caste was last collected during the British Raj in 1931. During the early census, people often exaggerated their caste status to garner social status and it is expected that people downgrade it now in the expectation of gaining government benefits.[6] There was speculation that there would be a caste-based census conduced in 2011, the first time for 80 years (last was in 1931), to find the exact population of the \\"Other Backward Classes\\" (OBCs) in India.[7][8][9][10] This was later accepted and the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 was conducted whose first findings were revealed on 3 July 2015 by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.[11] Mandal Commission report of 1980 quoted OBC population at 52%, though National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) survey of 2006 quoted OBC population at 41%[12]\\r\\nThere is only one instance of a caste-count in post-independence India.

The first, the house-listing phase, began on 1 April 2010 and involved collection of data about all the buildings and census houses.[16] Information for the National Population Register was also collected in the first phase. The second, the population enumeration phase, was conducted from 9 ÿ 28 February 2011 all over the country. The eradication of epidemics, the availability of more effective medicines for the treatment of various types of diseases and the improvement in the standard of living were the main reasons for the high decadal growth of population in India.\\r\\nThe House-listing schedule contained 35 questions.[17]\\r\\nThe Population enumeration schedule contained 30 questions.[18][19]\\r\\nThe National Population Register household schedule contained 9 questions.[20]\\r\\nOnce the information was collected and digitised, fingerprints were taken and photos collected.

Over half the population resided in the six most populous states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.[33] Of the 121 crore Indians, 83.3 crore (68.84%) live in rural areas while 37.7 crore stay in urban areas.[34][35] 45.36 crore people in India are migrants, which is 37.8% of total population.[36][37][38]\\r\\nIndia is the homeland of major belief systems such as Hinduism, Muslims, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism, while also being home to several indigenous faiths and tribal religions which have survived the influence of major religions for centuries.\\r\\nEver since its inception, the Census of India has been collecting and publishing information about the religious affiliations as expressed by the people of India.

It is the county seat of Tarrant County, covering nearly 350 square miles (910?km2) into three other counties; Denton, Parker and Wise. According to the 2016 census estimates, Fort Worth's population is 854,113.[4] The city is the second-largest in the DallasÿFort?WorthÿArlington metropolitan area (the \\"DFW Metroplex\\").\\r\\nThe city was established in 1849 as an Army outpost on a bluff overlooking the Trinity River. Today, Fort Worth still embraces its Western heritage and traditional architecture and design.[7][8] USS?Fort Worth?(LCS-3) is the first ship of the United States Navy named after the city.[9]\\r\\nFort Worth is home to the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition and several world-class museums designed by internationally known contemporary architects. The Kimbell Art Museum, considered to have one of the best collections in Texas, is housed in what is widely regarded as one of the state's foremost works of modern architecture, designed by Louis Kahn with an addition by Renzo Piano. Also of note is the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, designed by Tadao Ando. The Amon Carter Museum of American Art, designed by Philip Johnson, houses one of the world's most extensive collections of American art. The Sid Richardson Museum, redesigned by David M. Schwarz, has one of the most focused collections of Western Art in the U.S., emphasizing Frederic Remington and Charles Russell.\\r\\nThe city is stimulated by several university communities: Texas Christian University, Texas Wesleyan, University of North Texas Health Science Center, and Texas A&M University School of Law, and many multinational corporations, including Bell Helicopter, Lockheed Martin, American Airlines, BNSF Railway, Pier 1 Imports, XTO Energy and Radio Shack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Treaty of Bird's Fort between the Republic of Texas and several Native American tribes was signed in 1843 at Bird's Fort in present-day Arlington, Texas.[10][11] Article XI of the treaty provided that no one may \\"pass the line of trading houses\\" (at the border of the Indians' territory) without permission of the President of Texas, and may not reside or remain in the Indians' territory. These \\"trading houses\\" were later established at the junction of the Clear Fork and West Fork of the Trinity River in present-day Fort Worth.[12] At this river junction, the U.S. War Department established Fort Worth in 1849 as the northernmost of a system of 10 forts for protecting the American Frontier following the end of the MexicanÿAmerican War.[13] The City of Fort Worth continues to be known as \\"where the West begins.\\"[14]\\r\\nA line of seven army posts were established in 1848ÿ49 after the Mexican War to protect the settlers of Texas along the western American Frontier and included Fort Worth, Fort Graham, Fort Gates, Fort Croghan, Fort Martin Scott, Fort Lincoln, and Fort Duncan.[15] Originally 10 forts had been proposed by Major General William Jenkins Worth (1794ÿ1849), who commanded the Department of Texas in 1849. In January 1849, Worth proposed a line of 10 forts to mark the western Texas frontier from Eagle Pass to the confluence of the West Fork and Clear Fork of the Trinity River. One month later, Worth died from cholera in South Texas.[15]\\r\\nGeneral William S. Harney assumed command of the Department of Texas and ordered Major Ripley A. Arnold (Company F, Second United States Dragoons)[15] to find a new fort site near the West Fork and Clear Fork. On June 6, 1849, Arnold, advised by Middleton Tate Johnson, established a camp on the bank of the Trinity River and named the post Camp Worth in honor of the late General Worth. In August 1849, Arnold moved the camp to the north-facing bluff, which overlooked the mouth of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River. The United States War Department officially named the post Fort Worth on November 14, 1849.[16]\\r\\nNative American attacks were still a threat in the area, as this was their traditional territory and they resented encroachment by European-American settlers, but people from the United States set up homesteads near the fort. E. S. Terrell (1812ÿ1905) from Tennessee claimed to be the first resident of Fort Worth.[17] The fort was flooded the first year and moved to the top of the bluff; the current courthouse was built on this site. The fort was abandoned September 17, 1853.[15] No trace of it remains.\\r\\nAs a stop on the legendary Chisholm Trail, Fort Worth was stimulated by the business of the cattle drives and became a brawling, bustling town. Millions of head of cattle were driven north to market along this trail. Fort Worth became the center of the cattle drives, and later, the ranching industry. It was given the nickname of \\"Cowtown\\"[18].\\r\\nDuring Civil War, Fort Worth suffered from shortages of money, food, and supplies. the population dropped as low as 175, but began to recover during Reconstruction. By 1872, Jacob Samuels, William Jesse Boaz, and William Henry Davis had opened general stores. The next year, Khleber M. Van Zandt established Tidball, Van Zandt, and Company, which became Fort Worth National Bank in 1884.\\r\\nIn 1875, the Dallas Herald published an article by a former Fort Worth lawyer, Robert E. Cowart, who wrote that the decimation of Fort Worth's population, caused by the economic disaster and hard winter of 1873, had dealt a severe blow to the cattle industry. Added to the slowdown due to the railroad's stopping the laying of track 30 miles (48?km) outside of Fort Worth, Cowart said that Fort Worth was so slow that he saw a panther asleep in the street by the courthouse. Although an intended insult, the name Panther City was enthusiastically embraced when in 1876 Fort Worth recovered economically.[19] Many businesses and organizations continue to use Panther in their name. A panther is set at the top of the police department badges.[20]\\r\\nThe \\"Panther City\\" tradition is also preserved in the names and design of some of the city's geographical/architectural features, such as Panther Island (in the Trinity River), the Flat Iron Building, the Intermodal Transportation Center, and in two or three \\"Sleeping Panther\\" statues. In 1876, the Texas and Pacific Railway finally was completed to Fort Worth, stimulating a boom and transforming the Fort Worth Stockyards into a premier center for the cattle wholesale trade.[21] Migrants from the devastated war-torn South continued to swell the population, and small, community factories and mills yielded to larger businesses. Newly dubbed the \\"Queen City of the Prairies\\"[22], Fort Worth supplied a regional market via the growing transportation network.\\r\\nFort Worth became the westernmost railhead and a transit point for cattle shipment. Louville Niles, a Boston, Massachusetts-based businessman and main shareholder of the Fort Worth Stockyards Company is credited with bringing the two biggest meat packing firms at the time, Armour and Swift, to the stockyards[23].\\r\\nWith the boom times came a variety of entertainments and related problems. Fort Worth had a knack for separating cattlemen from their money. Cowboys took full advantage of their last brush with civilization before the long drive on the Chisholm Trail from Fort Worth up north to Kansas. They stocked up on provisions from local merchants, visited saloons for a bit of gambling and carousing, then galloped northward with their cattle only to whoop it up again on their way back. The town soon became home to \\"Hell's Half-Acre\\", the biggest collection of saloons, dance halls, and bawdy houses south of Dodge City (the northern terminus of the Chisholm Trail), giving Fort Worth the nickname of \\"The Paris of the Plains\\".[24][25]\\r\\nCertain sections of town were off-limits for proper citizens. Shootings, knifings, muggings, and brawls became a nightly occurrence. Cowboys were joined by a motley assortment of buffalo hunters, gunmen, adventurers, and crooks. Hell's Half Acre (also known as simply \\"The Acre\\") expanded as more people were drawn to the town. Occasionally, the Acre was referred to as \\"the bloody Third Ward\\" after it was designated one of the city's three political wards in 1876. By 1900, the Acre covered four of the city's main north-south thoroughfares.[26] Local citizens became alarmed about the activities, electing Timothy Isaiah \\"Longhair Jim\\" Courtright in 1876 as city marshal with a mandate to tame it.\\r\\nCourtright sometimes collected and jailed 30 people on a Saturday night, but allowed the gamblers to operate, as they attracted money to the city. After learning that train and stagecoach robbers, such as the Sam Bass gang, were using the area as a hideout, he intensified law enforcement, but certain businessmen advertised against too many restriction in the area as having bad effects on the legitimate businesses. Gradually, the cowboys began to avoid the area; as businesses suffered, the city moderated its opposition. Courtright lost his office in 1879.[26]\\r\\nDespite crusading mayors such as H. S. Broiles and newspaper editors such as B. B. Paddock, the Acre survived because it generated income for the city (all of it illegal) and excitement for visitors. Longtime Fort Worth residents claimed the place was never as wild as its reputation, but during the 1880s, Fort Worth was a regular stop on the \\"gambler's circuit\\"[26] by Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday, and the Earp brothers (Wyatt, Morgan, and Virgil). James Earp, the eldest of his brothers, lived with his wife in Fort Worth during this period; their house was at the edge of Hell's Half Acre, at 9th and Calhoun. He often tended bar at the Cattlemen's Exchange saloon in the \\"uptown\\" part of the city.[27]\\r\\nReforming citizens objected to the dance halls, where men and women mingled; by contrast, the saloons or gambling parlors had primarily male customers.\\r\\nIn the late 1880s, Mayor Broiles and County Attorney R. L. Carlock initiated a reform campaign. In a public shootout on February 8, 1887, Jim Courtright was killed on Main Street by Luke Short, who claimed he was \\"King of Fort Worth Gamblers.\\" [26] As Courtright had been popular, when Short was jailed for his murder, rumors floated of lynching him. Short's good friend Bat Masterson came armed and spent the night in his cell to protect him.\\r\\nThe first prohibition campaign in Texas was mounted in Fort Worth in 1889, allowing other business and residential development in the area. Another change was the influx of black residents. Excluded by state segregation from the business end of town and the more costly residential areas, the city's black citizens settled into the southern portion of the city. The popularity and profitability of the Acre declined and more derelicts and the homeless were seen on the streets. By 1900, most of the dance halls and gamblers were gone. Cheap variety shows and prostitution became the chief forms of entertainment. Some politicians sought reforms under the Progressive Era.[26]\\r\\nIn 1911, the Reverend J. Frank Norris launched an offensive against racetrack gambling in the Baptist Standard and used the pulpit of the First Baptist Church of Fort Worth to attack vice and prostitution. When he began to link certain Fort Worth businessmen with property in the Acre and announce their names from his pulpit, the battle heated up. On February 4, 1912, Norris's church was burned to the ground; that evening, his enemies tossed a bundle of burning oiled rags onto his porch, but the fire was extinguished and caused minimal damage. A month later, the arsonists succeeded in burning down the parsonage. In a sensational trial lasting a month, Norris was charged with perjury and arson in connection with the two fires. He was acquitted, but his continued attacks on the Acre accomplished little until 1917. A new city administration and the federal government, which was eyeing Fort Worth as a potential site for a major military training camp, joined forces with the Baptist preacher to bring down the final curtain on the Acre.\\r\\nThe police department compiled statistics showing that 50% of the violent crime in Fort Worth occurred in the Acre, which confirmed respectable citizens' opinion of the area. After Camp Bowie (a World War I Army training installation) was located on the outskirts of Fort Worth in 1917, the military used martial law to regulate prostitutes and barkeepers of the Acre. Fines and stiff jail sentences curtailed their activities. By the time Norris held a mock funeral parade to \\"bury John Barleycorn\\" in 1919, the Acre had become a part of Fort Worth history. The name continues to be associated with the southern end of Fort Worth.[28]\\r\\nOn March 28, 2000, at 6:15 pm, an F3 (some estimates claim an F4) tornado smashed through downtown, tearing many buildings into shreds and scrap metal. One of the hardest-hit structures was the Bank One Tower, which was one of the dominant features of the Fort Worth skyline and which had Reata, a popular restaurant, on its top floor. It has since been converted to upscale condominiums and officially renamed \\"The Tower\\". This was the first major tornado to strike Fort Worth proper since the early 1940s.[29]\\r\\nWhen oil began to gush in West Texas in the early 20th century, and again in the late 1970s, Fort Worth was at the center of the wheeling and dealing. In July 2007, advances in horizontal drilling technology made vast natural gas reserves in the Barnett Shale available directly under the city, helping many residents receive royalty checks for their mineral rights.[citation needed] Today, the city of Fort Worth and many residents are dealing with the benefits and issues associated with the natural gas reserves under ground.[30][31]\\r\\nFort Worth was the fastest-growing large city in the United States from 2000 to 2006[32] and was voted one of \\"America's Most Livable Communities.\\"[33]\\r\\nFort Worth is located in North Texas, and has a generally humid subtropical climate.[34] It is part of the Cross Timbers region;[35] this region is a boundary between the more heavily forested eastern parts and the rolling hills and prairies of the central part.

The park includes an agility course, water fountains, shaded shelters and waste stations.[58]\\r\\nWhile much of Fort Worth's sports attention is focused on the Metroplex's professional sports teams, the city has its own athletic identity. The TCU Horned Frogs compete in NCAA Division I athletics, including the football team, consistently ranked in the top 25, and the baseball team, which has competed in the last six NCAA tournaments and 3 straight College World Series, coming within a win of making the College World Series finals in 2009 and 2016.

I Men's Basketball championship and three-time National Collegiate Table Tennis Association (NCTTA) team championships (2004ÿ2006). Fort Worth is also home to the NCAA football Bell Helicopter Armed Forces Bowl, as well as four minor-league professional sports teams. One of these minor league teams, the Fort Worth Cats baseball team, was reborn in 2001. The original Cats were a very popular minor league team in Fort Worth from the 19th century (when they were called the Panthers) until 1960, when the team was merged into the Dallas Rangers.\\r\\nThe presence of Texas Christian University less than 5 miles (8?km) from downtown and national competitiveness in football, baseball, and men's and women's basketball have sustained TCU as an important part of Fort Worth's sports scene.\\r\\nThe Horned Frog football team produced two national championships in the 1930s and remained a strong competitor in the Southwest Conference into the 1960s before beginning a long period of underperformance. The revival of the TCU football program began under Coach Dennis Franchione with the success of running back LaDainian Tomlinson. Under Head Coach Gary Patterson, the Horned Frogs have developed into a perennial top-10 contender, and a Rose Bowl winner in 2011. Notable players include Sammy Baugh, Davey O'Brien, Bob Lilly, LaDainian Tomlinson, Jerry Hughes, and Andy Dalton. The Horned Frogs, along with their rivals and fellow non-AQ leaders the Boise State Broncos and University of Utah Utes, were deemed the quintessential \\"BCS Busters\\", having appeared in both the Fiesta and Rose Bowls. Their \\"BCS Buster\\" role ended in 2012 when they joined the Big 12 athletic conference in all sports. The Horned Frog football teams have one of the best winning percentages of any school in the Football Bowl Subdivision in recent years.\\r\\nFort Worth hosts an important professional men's golf tournament every May at the Colonial Country Club.

Its first line began operating in December 1876, and traveled from the courthouse down Main Street to the T&P Depot.[73] By 1890, more than 20 private companies were operating streetcar lines in Fort Worth. The Fort Worth Street Railway Company bought out many of its competitors, and was eventually itself bought out by the Bishop & Sherwin Syndicate in 1901.[74] The new ownership changed the company's name to the Northern Texas Traction Company, which operated 84 miles of streetcar railways in 1925, and their lines connected downtown Fort Worth to TCU, the Near Southside, Arlington Heights, Lake Como, and the Stockyards.\\r\\nAt its peak, the electric interurban industry in Texas consisted of almost 500 miles of track, making Texas the second in interurban mileage in all states west of the Mississippi River. Electric interurban railways were prominent in the early 1900s, peaking in the 1910s and fading until all electric interurban railways were abandoned by 1948. Close to three-fourths of the mileage was in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, running between Fort Worth and Dallas and to other area cities including Cleburne, Denison, Corsicana, and Waco.

Originally named Amon Carter Field after one of the city's influential mayors, Greater Southwest opened in 1953 and operated as the primary airport for Fort Worth until 1974. It was then abandoned until the terminal was torn down in 1980. The site of the former airport is now a mixed-use development straddled by Texas State Highway 183 and 360. One small section of runway remains north of Highway 183, and serves as the only reminder that a major commercial airport once occupied the site.\\r\\nFort Worth is home to these four airports within city limits:\\r\\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Fort Worth 47th-most walkable of 50 largest U.S. cities.[83]\\r\\nBiking\\r\\nThe Fort Worth Bike Sharing is a nonprofit organization that controls Fort Worth B-Cycle, a bike-sharing program introduced to the area on April 22, 2013.

Its outer boundary lies 2,890?km (1,800?mi) beneath Earth's surface. The transition between the inner core and outer core is located approximately 5,150?km (3,200?mi) beneath the Earth's surface. Unlike the inner core, the outer core is liquid. The inner core is also referred to as the solid core.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeismic inversions of body waves and normal modes constrain the radius of the outer core to be 3483?km with an uncertainty of 5?km, while that of the inner core is 1220I10?km.[3]:94\\r\\nEstimates for the temperature of the outer core are about 3,000ÿ4,500?K (2,730ÿ4,230?C; 4,940ÿ7,640?F) in its outer regions and 4,000ÿ8,000?K (3,730ÿ7,730?C; 6,740ÿ13,940?F) near the inner core.[4] Evidence for a fluid outer core includes from seismology which shows that seismic shear-waves are not transmitted through the outer core[5] Because of its high temperature, modeling work has shown that the outer core is a low viscosity fluid that convects turbulently.[4] Eddy currents in the nickel iron fluid of the outer core are believed to influence the Earth's magnetic field. The average magnetic field strength in the Earth's outer core was measured to be 2.5 millitesla, 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface.[6][7] The outer core is not under enough pressure to be solid, so it is liquid even though it has a composition similar to the inner core. Sulfur and oxygen could be present in the outer core.[8]\\r\\nAs heat is transferred outward toward the mantle, the net trend is for the inner boundary of the liquid region to freeze, causing the solid inner core to grow.

The character appeared in a series of twelve novels and two short story collections written by Fleming and a number of continuation novels and spin-off works after Fleming's death in 1964. There have been twenty-six films in total, produced between 1962 and 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleming portrayed Bond as a tall, athletic, handsome secret agent in his thirties or forties; he has several vices including drinking, smoking, gambling, automobiles and womanising. He is an exceptional marksman, and skilled in unarmed combat, skiing, swimming and golf. While Bond kills without hesitation or regret, he usually kills only when carrying out orders, while acting in self-defence and occasionally as revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican actor Barry Nelson was the first to portray Bond on screen, in a 1954 television adaptation, \\"Casino Royale\\". In 1961 Eon Productions began work on Dr. No, an adaptation of the novel of the same name. The result was a film that spawned a series of twenty-four films produced by Eon Productions and two independent films. After considering the likes of \\"refined\\" English actors such as Cary Grant and David Niven, the producers cast Sean Connery as Bond in the film. Fleming was appalled at the selection of the uncouth, 31-year-old Scottish actor, considering him to be the antithesis of his character. However, Connery's physical prowess and sexual magnetism in the role came to be closely identified with the character, with Fleming ultimately changing his view on Connery and incorporating aspects of his portrayal into the books.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven actors in total have portrayed Bond on film. Following Connery's portrayal, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig have assumed the role. These screen versions have retained many traits from Fleming's depiction, although some of Bond's less fashionable attitudes have been dropped, such as racism, homophobia, retaining the services of a maid, and in the more recent films, smoking. Despite playing the same character, there have been notable differences among the portrayals. Daniel Craig is the incumbent Bond in the long-running Eon series, and played the part for a fourth time in the latest film, Spectre, released in October 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Secret Service agent, James Bond was a composite based on a number of commandos whom author Ian Fleming had known during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, to whom he added his own style and a number of his own tastes. Fleming appropriated his character's name from the eponymous American ornithologist. Bond's code number 007 comes from one of British naval intelligence's key achievements of World War I: the breaking of the German diplomatic code.[1] One of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram, which was coded 0075,[2] and which was one of the factors that led the US entering the war. Subsequently, if material was graded 00 it meant it was highly classified. Fleming later told a journalist: \\"When I was at the Admiralty?... all the top-secret signals had the double-0 prefix?... and I decided to borrow it for Bond.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough James Bond is in his mid-to-late thirties, he does not age in Fleming's stories.[3] Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett noted that, \\"within the first few pages [of Casino Royale] Ian had introduced most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks\\", which included his looks, his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits:[4] Bond's penchant for alcohol runs throughout the series of books[5] and he smokes up to 70 cigarettes a day.[6][a]\\r\\n\\r\\nFleming decided to underplay Bond's character, observing: \\"Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure.\\"[9] On another occasion, he reinforced his point: \\"When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSean Connery was the first actor to portray Bond on film in Dr. No (1962). An amateur bodybuilder, he had come to the attention of the Bond film producers after several appearances in British films from the late 1950s.[11] At a muscular 6'2\\", Connery was initially met with disapproval from Fleming, who believed him to be an overgrown stuntman who lacked the finesse and elegance to play James Bond; he envisaged a suave actor, such as David Niven playing the role.[12] Producer Albert R. Broccoliknown to all as Cubbydisagreed with Fleming's view, later commenting that \\"I wanted a ballsy guy?... put a bit of veneer over that tough Scottish hide and you've got Fleming's Bond instead of all the mincing poofs we had applying for the job\\".[13] Eon's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal,[14] an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman who said, after appearing with Connery in Goldfinger, \\"He was exceedingly handsome, virile and sexy and that really was the tenor of what the script was always trying to display\\".[15] After Connery was chosen, director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser,[16] and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor \\"in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nConnery's interpretation of the character differed considerably from Fleming's, being more promiscuous and cold blooded than the literary version.[18] Connery described Bond as \\"a complete sensualistsenses highly tuned, awake to everything, quite amoral. I particularly like him because he thrives on conflict\\".[19] Academic James Chapman observed that for Dr. No, Connery's interpretation of the character, although not complete, showed the actor \\"should be credited with having established a new style of performance: a British screen hero in the manner of an American leading man\\".[20] In his second film, From Russia with Love, Connery looked less nervous and edgy; he gave \\"a relaxed, wry performance of subtle wit and style\\".[21] Pfeiffer and Worrall noted that Connery \\"personified James Bond with such perfection that even Ian Fleming?... admitted that it was difficult imagining anyone else in the part\\";[22][b] academic Jeremy Black agreed and declared that \\"Connery made the role his own and created the Bond audience for the cinema\\".[26] Black also observed that Connery gave the character a \\"spare, pared-down character?... [with] inner bleakness along with the style\\".[26] Connery played Bond with \\"the right mix of cool charisma, violence and arrogance?... against which all others are judged\\".[27] Raymond Benson perceived that Connery \\"embodies a ruggedness and an intense screen presence this transcends any preconceived notions about the character\\".[28] Benson also noted that Bond was witty, but contains \\"an assured toughness that epitomises the machismo male\\".[28] Roger Moore agreed with Black and Benson, commenting that \\"Sean was Bond. He created Bond. He embodied Bond and because of Sean, Bond became an instantly recognisable character the world overhe was rough, tough, mean and witty?... he was a bloody good 007\\".[29] However, despite his charm and virility, Connery was characteristically laconic in his delivery.[30][31] Christopher Bray says of him that \\"in his single-minded, laconic, mocking, self-sufficient vanity, Connery's Bond was the epitome of sixties consumer culture\\".[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nInterviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965, Connery identified where he had altered the character for the films, saying \\"I said to the producers that the character had one defect, there was no humor about him; to get him accepted, they'd have to let me play him tongue-in-cheek, so people could laugh. They agreed, and there you are: today Bond is accepted to such an extent that even philosophers take the trouble to analyze him, even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him. And even while they're laughing at him, people take him terribly seriously\\".[33] Connery went on to add that \\"Bond is important: this invincible superman that every man would like to copy, that every woman would like to conquer, this dream we all have of survival. And then one can't help liking him\\".[33] After the pressures of five films in six years, Connery left the role after the 1967 film You Only Live Twice saying, \\"It became a terrible pressure, like living in a goldfish bowl?... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond. Also I had become completely identified with it, and it became very wearing and very boring\\".[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a hiatus of one filmOn Her Majesty's Secret Service, in which George Lazenby played BondConnery returned to the role for Diamonds Are Forever after David Picker, the head of United Artists, made it clear that Connery was to be enticed back to the role and that money was no object. When approached about resuming the role of Bond, Connery demandedand receiveda fee of S1.25 million (S24 million in 2016 pounds),[35] 12.5% of the gross profits[36] and, as a further enticement, United Artists offered to back two films of his choice.[37][c] His performance received mixed reviews, with Raymond Benson considering that Connery \\"looks weary and bored?... he is overweight, slow-moving, and doesn't seem to be trying to create a credible character\\".[39] Despite that, Benson considers that Connery \\"still radiates more screen presence than Roger Moore or George Lazenby\\".[39] On the other hand, Pauline Kael said \\"Connery's James Bond is less lecherous than before and less foppishand he's better this way\\".[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1980s producer Jack Schwartzman moved ahead with a non-Eon Bond film, following the controversy over the 1961 novel Thunderball[41] and the subsequent long legal battle;[42] the result was Never Say Never Again. Connery accepted an offer to play Bond once more, asking for (and receiving) a fee of $3 million ($7 million in 2017 dollars),[43] a percentage of the profits, as well as casting, director and script approval.[44] The script has several references to Bond's advancing yearsplaying on Connery being 52 at the time of filming.[44][45] David Robinson, reviewing the film for The Times considered that, \\"Connery?... is back, looking hardly a day older or thicker, and still outclassing every other exponent of the role, in the goodnatured throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way\\".[46] In 2003 Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Sean Connery had been cast in November 1961,[51] David Niven had been Fleming's choice for the role as the actor reflected his image of the character.[12] In 1965 producer Charles Feldman signed Niven to play Sir James Bond for Casino Royale, a film not made by Eon Productions. Connery and Peter Sellers had both turned down the role.[52][53] Niven was 56 when he played Bond[54] and his characterisation was that of an elderly man who had won the Victoria Cross at the Siege of Mafeking, had a daughter by his lover, the spy Mata Hari, played Claude Debussy on the piano, ate royal jelly and cultivated black roses.[55][56] The concept of Bond is that once Niven's Bond retired, his name and 007 designation was passed to another agent to keep the legend alive; James Chapman notes that the implication was that the \\"other Bond\\" was that played by Connery.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nChapman considered the concept of an elderly Bond to be an interesting one, with Bond referring to Connery's Bond as a \\"sexual acrobat who leaves a trail of beautiful dead women behind like blown roses\\".[57] In line with the literary Bond, Niven's character drives a vintage Bentley, rather than the Aston Martin favoured by Connery.[57] Bond scholar Steven Jay Rubin thought Niven perfectly cast as the retired Bond, and saw him as \\"a throw-back to the hell-for-leather adventure heroes\\" of the character, which paralleled Niven's own life and career.[58] Barnes and Hearn describe this as a \\"perfectly fair interpretation\\", given the way Niven approached the role,[59] while Raymond Benson thinks casting Niven was \\"intelligent\\".[60] Jeremy Black questioned the use of Niven in the role, observing that he did not seem to be a killer, and did not have the \\"disconcerting edge\\" that Connery had.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the departure of Connery after You Only Live Twice, Broccoli and director Peter R. Hunt chose Australian George Lazenby to play the role of Bond. He first came to their attention after seeing him in a Fry's Chocolate Cream advertisement.[61] Lazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Savile Row suit (ordered, but uncollected, by Connery), and going to Connery's barber at the Dorchester Hotel.[62] Lazenby consolidated his claim during a screen test, when he accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt coordinator, in the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression.[63] Lazenby never signed a contract, with negotiations dragging on during production,[64] and he was subsequently convinced by his agent Ronan O'Rahilly that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s; as a result he left the role before the release of On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969.[61] For his performance as Bond, Lazenby was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year ÿ Actor at the 27th Golden Globe Awards.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nCritical opinion was split about Lazenby; he has been considered to have been the worst Bond,[66] and has variously been described as \\"laconic and humourless\\",[18] \\"a little stiff\\"[67] and \\"annoying and smug\\".[68] Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he \\"is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache\\".[69] The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that \\"Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement\\".[70] Pauline Kael called Lazenby \\"quite a dull fellow\\" in her otherwise positive review in The New Yorker.[71] However, Peter R. Hunt, director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, stated that Lazenby should have undertaken more films in the role, saying \\"he would have made a very credible Bond and been very good indeed\\".[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith and Lavington consider that Lazenby \\"had chosen to play Bond the same way as Sean Connery had, with perhaps more humility and humanity\\";[73] they went on to say that \\"Lazenby's inexperience rarely shows\\" in the film, and that \\"he invariably rises to the occasion\\".[74] Alexander Walker in the London Evening Standard said that, \\"The truth is that George Lazenby is almost as good a James Bond as the man referred to in his film as 'the other fellow'. Lazenby's voice is more suave than sexy-sinister and he could pass for the other fellow's twin on the shady side of the casino. Bond is now definitely all set for the Seventies\\".[75] Judith Crist of New York Magazine commented that, \\"This time around there's less suavity and a no-nonsense muscularity and maleness to the role via the handsome Mr. Lazenby\\".[76] Feminist film critic Molly Haskell wrote an approving review in the Village Voice: \\"Lazenby?... seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates\\".[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Chapman considers that Lazenby looks the part of Bond, identifying his athleticism and \\"arrogant swagger\\", which \\"convey the snobbery of the character\\".[78] Chapman also distinguished a more vulnerable and human characterisation in Bondfeeling exhausted and falling in loveas opposed to the \\"heroic superman\\" of Connery.[78] Brian Fairbanks noted that \\"OHMSS gives us a James Bond capable of vulnerability, a man who can show fear and is not immune to heartbreak. Lazenby is that man, and his performance is superb\\".[79] Ben Macintyre also observed that of all the Bonds, Lazenby's characterisation was closest to that of Fleming's original character.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Diamonds Are Forever, Broccoli and Saltzman tried to convince Sean Connery to return as Bond, but he declined.[80] After considering Jeremy Brett, Michael Billington and Julian Glover,[81][82] the two producers finally turned to Roger Moore, who they had previously discussed for On Her Majesty's Secret Service, but who had been unavailable, and he was ultimately cast to play Bond in Live and Let Die.[63][83] At the time Moore was an established television actor, known for his performances as Simon Templar in The Saint and Lord Brett Sinclair in The Persuaders!: in both of which he played a \\"charming, debonair, international playboy\\".[84] When playing Bond, Moore tried not to imitate either Connery or his previous roles, and screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay around Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted feel to Bond,[80] an approach that led Raymond Benson to describe Moore's Bond as \\"a rather smarmy, eyebrow-raising international playboy who never seemed to get hurt\\".[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilm writer Andrew Spicer considered Roger Moore to be the most elegant and mannerly of the Bonds, with the voice and style of an English debonair country gentleman.[86] Benson agreed, stating that Moore was, \\"too nice and well-mannered to be a James Bond of any real substance\\",[23] while Doug Pratt said that \\"the writers worked out an amenable personality for Roger Moore and found a breezy balance between comedy and action\\".[87] To make Moore's character appear tougher, a Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum  which at the time was associated with the macho image of the Clint Eastwood character, Dirty Harry  was chosen for Moore to use in Live and Let Die rather than Bond's usual choice of Walther PPK.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpicer says \\"Roger Moore re-created Bond as an old-style debonair hero, more polished and sophisticated than Connery's incarnation, using the mocking insouciance he had perfected in his role as Simon Templar?... Moore's humour was a throwaway, and certainly in the later films, verged on self-parody. It was an essential strand in the increasingly tongue-in-cheek direction of the series which became more light-hearted, knowing and playfully intertextual\\".[86] Chapman noted that Moore was the most comedic of the Bonds, with a more light-hearted approach to playing the character with a mocking wit and innuendo.[84] Additionally, Moore's one-liners were delivered in a way to suggest that the violence inherent in the films was a joke, as opposed to Connery's, which was used to mitigate the violence.[89] Moore explained his approach to the humour by saying \\"to me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous?... I mean, this man is supposed to be a spy, and yet everybody knows he's a spy?... it's outrageous. So you have to treat the humour outrageously as well\\".[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nPauline Kael was a fairly vocal critic of Moore's, dismissing him as an \\"iceberg\\" in The Man with the Golden Gun. In reviewing For Your Eyes Only, she wrote \\"Roger Moore is Bond again, and his idea of Bond's imperturbable cool is the same as playing dead\\". Reviewing Moonraker, she wrote \\"Roger Moore is dutiful and passive as Bond; his clothes are neatly pressed and he shows up for work, like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension\\". Only in The Spy Who Loved Me, one of Kael's favourite Bond films, did she praise him describing him as self-effacing: \\"Moore gets the chance to look scaredan emotion that suits him and makes him more likable\\".[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of Moore's personal preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his taste for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits were assigned to the character.[91] Moore's use for cigars in his early films put him in contrast to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton.[92] By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985 Moore appeared in his seventh and final film, A View to a Kill; he was 57 (he appeared alongside co-star Tanya Roberts, who was 30).[94] Critics focused on Moore's age:[95] The Washington Post said \\"Moore isn't just long in the tooth ÿ he's got tusks, and what looks like an eye job has given him the pie-eyed blankness of a zombie. He's not believable anymore in the action sequences, even less so in the romantic scenes\\".[96] When he was cast for the film, Moore recalled that he felt \\"a bit long in the tooth\\",[97] and in December 2007 admitted that he \\"was only about four hundred years too old for the part\\".[98] Like Connery, Moore appeared as Bond in seven films; by the time he retired in 1985, he was the oldest actor to play 007 in the Eon series,[99] and his Bond films had earned over $1 billion at the box office.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the retirement of Roger Moore in 1985, a search for a new actor to play Bond took place that saw a number of actors, including Sam Neill,[102] Pierce Brosnan[103] and Timothy Dalton, audition for the role in 1986. Bond co-producer Michael G. Wilson, director John Glen, Dana and Barbara Broccoli \\"were impressed with Sam Neill and very much wanted to use him\\", although Bond producer Albert R. Broccoli was not sold on the actor.[104] Dalton and Brosnan were both considered by Eon,[105][106] but after Brosnan was eventually ruled out by his Remington Steele contract,[103] Dalton was appointed in August 1986[107] on a salary of $5.2?million.[36] When he was either 24 or 25 years old Dalton had discussed playing Bond with Broccoli, but decided he was too young to accept the role, thinking Bond should be played between 35 and 40 years old.[105] In preparing for the role, Dalton, a green-eyed, dark haired, slender, 6'2\\" (1 m 88?cm) classically trained Shakespearean actor,[108] was keen to portray the character as accurately as possible, reading up extensively on the books before his role in The Living Daylights (1987). [109]\\r\\n\\r\\nDalton's Bond was a serious one: dark, cold, emotional, stern, ruthless, showing little humour, and focused as a killer with little time for fun and indulgence.[18][110] Dalton's interpretation of the character came from his \\"desire to see a darker Bond\\",[111] one that was \\"less of a womaniser, tougher and closer to the darker character Ian Fleming wrote about\\".[111] James Chapman also considered Dalton to be closer to Fleming's Bond than the previous actors, writing that Dalton was \\"clearly less comfortable?... with the witty asides and one-liners?... so he becomes something closer to the Bond of the books, who rarely develops a sense of humour\\".[112] When reviewing Licence to Kill, Iain Johnstone of The Sunday Times disagreed, declaring that \\"any vestiges of the gentleman spy?... by Ian Fleming\\" have now gone;[113] he went on to say that \\"this character is remarkably close both in deed and action to the eponymous hero of the new Batman film\\".[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all viewers were taken with Dalton. Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail was entirely dismissive. \\"The new Bond has been widely described in feature stories as a throwback to the Ian Fleming original (studying the Fleming novels, Dalton was pleased to discover that Bond was a human being, he says), and that may be true, if the Fleming original lacked charm, sex appeal and wit. Timothy Dalton's Bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity, and eschews promiscuity ÿ Dirtless Harry. You get the feeling that on his off nights, he might curl up with the Reader's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting ÿ he'd try to memorize the jokes ÿ before nodding off under the influence of Ovaltine. The British reviews of The Living Daylights have been laudatory, perhaps because this Bond is the most British of all, if British is to be understood as a synonym for reserved\\".[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nRaymond Benson noted that Dalton \\"purposely played Bond as a ruthless and serious man with very little of the wit displayed by Connery, Lazenby or Moore\\",[115] and considered him to be \\"the most accurate and literal interpretation of the role?... ever seen on screen\\".[116] His character also reflected a degree of moral ambiguity; in Licence to Kill, for instance, he becomes a rogue agent,[86] while Dalton himself saw the character as a \\"man, not a superhuman; a man who is beset with moral confusions and apathies and uncertainties, and who is often very frightened and nervous and tense\\".[116] Smith and Lavington observed that during Dalton's portrayal in Licence to Kill, Bond appeared \\"self-absorbed?... reckless, brutal, prone to nervous laughter and?... probably insane, or at least seriously disturbed.[117] In the light of Licence to Kill, one academic, Martin Willis, referred to Dalton's Bond as a \\"muscular vigilante\\".[118] Steven Jay Rubin noted that Dalton's films had \\"a hard-edged reality and some unflinching violent episodes that were better suited to Dalton's more realistic approach to the character\\".[119] Rubin considered Dalton's portrayal to be \\"Fleming's Bond?... the suffering Bond\\".[120] In contrast to the previous incarnations of the character, Smith and Lavington identified Dalton's humour as \\"brooding rather than flippant\\";[121] combined with his heavy smoking, they considered him \\"an effective leading man\\".[121] Eoghan Lyng, writing for The James Bond Dossier, favourably compared him to Daniel Craig, stating that \\"Despite chronological placement, it was Dalton, not Brosnan, who proved to be the prototype for the 21st century Bond.\\".[122] Although Bond screenwriter Richard Maibaum called Sean Connery the best Bond, he considered Dalton the best actor of the four he worked with.[123] His predecessor, Roger Moore also felt that  Dalton was the best actor to play Bond.[124] Director John Glen also felt that Dalton was the best actor that portrayed Bond, and that he was ahead of his time, noting the comparisons between Daniel Craig's incarnation to that of Dalton's.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nDalton's films did not perform as well at the box office as most of the previous films. Commentators such as Screen International considered the Bond series had run its course in the age of series such as Indiana Jones and Lethal Weapon.[126] Edward P. Comentale observed that \\"Dalton, for all his occasional flat northern vowels, was probably too much the stage actor to be convincing as an action hero in the age of Willis, Schwarzenegger and Stallone\\".[127] After just two filmsThe Living Daylights and Licence to Killlitigation ensued over the licensing of the Bond catalogue, delaying what would have been Dalton's third film by several years. His six-year contract expired in 1993 and he left the series in 1994.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Timothy Dalton retired from the Bond role in 1994, Eon turned to the actor they had considered after A View to a Kill: Pierce Brosnan.[103] He was offered a three-film contract, with an option on a fourth;[129] his salary for his first film, GoldenEye, was $4?million, which rose to $16.5?million for his fourth and final outing, Die Another Day.[36] Brosnan had first met Broccoli on the set of For Your Eyes Only, when Brosnan's wife, Cassandra Harris, was appearing in the film as Countess Lisl von Schlaf, and the couple lunched with Broccoli during filming.[81] Brosnan went on to play a criminal-turned-private investigator in Remington Steele in the 1980s,[99] where he captured some of the traits of previous Bonds in playing the role: like Moore, he exemplified a high degree of suavity, elegance, charm and wit,[18][130][131] but displayed a masculinity and grittiness on occasion reminiscent of Connery's Bond, both successfully \\"combine the character's Englishness with a classless internationalism that is highly knowing\\".[132] Andrew Spicer says that \\"Brosnan's frame carries the 'Armani look' with its refined understated Englishness, to perfection. His lithe, sinuous athleticism is well suited to the fast-paced action and state-of-the-art gadgetry that retains the series' core appeal\\".[132] James Chapman also considered Brosnan's appearance striking, saying the actor had \\"old-fashioned, darkly handsome matinee idol looks\\".[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Brosnan, the Bond writers knew that because of the changes in public attitudes, he could not be as overtly sexual and dominant over women as Connery's Bond, and was denounced by M in GoldenEye to be a \\"sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War\\".[132] Brosnan was seen by many as the quintessential James Bond in appearance and manner; displaying an air of coolness, elegance and a grace which made him believable as an international playboy, if not purely as an assassin. John G. Stackhouse for instance argues that it is preposterous that any man as strikingly handsome as Brosnan and Connery could be a secret agent, saying, \\"When Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan enters a room, everyone notices. Thus it is ridiculous to suppose that James Bond, looking like that, could be a secret agent for longer than about two seconds\\".[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrosnan's Bond was introduced in GoldenEye; James Chapman argues that the film works his portrayal of Bond into the history of the others in the series through the post-credits sequence use of the Aston Martin DB5, previously seen in Goldfinger and Thunderball, \\"thus immediately evoking the memory of [Sean] Connery\\".[135] Brosnan's characterisation of Bond was seen by Jeremy Black as being \\"closer to the Fleming novels than Moore?... yet he is also lighter and less intense than Dalton\\".[136] Black also commented that the shift in character in the first three films reflected changing social opinions, with Bond not smoking.[137] Brosnan was clear he wanted to change Bond's smoking habit, saying \\"I don't give a damn about everyone's perception of the character: I think smoking causes cancer therefore he doesn't smoke\\",[129] although he did smoke a Cuban cigar in Die Another Day.[138] Brosnan continued with the use of humour prevalent with other portrayals,[139] and provided a \\"mix of action and danger threaded through with the right amount of wit and humour\\";[140] Smith and Lavington saw the humour largely as puns that were \\"flippant, but not crass\\".[141]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter four films in the role, Brosnan stated he wished to do one final Bond film. Although plans were made for a film to be released in 2004, negotiations stalled and Brosnan announced his intention to leave in July 2004.[142]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 October 2005 Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment announced at a press conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series.[143] A tuxedo- and lifejacket-clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat.[144] Craig had based his acceptance of the role on the strength of the script for the first film, Casino Royale; he later recalled that \\"once I sat down and read the story, I just thought that I wanted to tell [it]?... I'm a big Bond fan, and I love what he represents\\".[145] Significant controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond.com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest.[146] Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed.[147] Many disparagingly called him \\"James Blonde\\", believing the 5?ft 10?in (1.78?m) blond-haired blue-eyed rugged Craig to be far fitting from the traditional tall, dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him. The Daily Mirror ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, The Name's Bland ÿ James Bland.[148]\\r\\n\\r\\nCraig first played Bond in the 2006 film Casino Royale, an adaptation of Fleming's novel of the same name and a reboot of the Eon series,[149] which saw Bond earn his 00 status.[150] Despite the negative press on his appointment, Craig was widely praised by critics and former Bonds after the release of Casino Royale, believing him to have been the first actor to truly nail Fleming's character in the book: Todd McCarthy, reviewing the film for Variety, considered that \\"Craig comes closer to the author's original conception of this exceptionally long-lived male fantasy figure than anyone since early Sean Connery\\",[151] and he went on to say that \\"Craig once and for all claims the character as his own\\",[151] while Steven Spielberg called Craig \\"the perfect 21st-century Bond\\".[152]\\r\\nPaul Arendt, writing for the BBC, agreed, observing that \\"Daniel Craig is not a good Bond. He's a great Bond. Specifically, he is 007 as conceived by Ian Fleminga professional killing machine, a charming, cold-hearted patriot with a taste for luxury. Craig is the first actor to really nail 007's defining characteristic: he's an absolute swine\\".[153] James Chapman commented on the realism and violence in the film noting that Bond is seen to seriously bleed for the first time in the series; Chapman also identified a number of violent scenes which make Casino Royale notable in the series.[154] In 2012 Skyfall was released: it was Craig's third outing as 007. Reviewing the film, Philip French, writing in The Observer, considered that Craig managed to \\"get out of the shadow of Connery\\",[155] while the New Statesman thought that he had \\"relaxed into Bond without losing any steeliness\\".[156]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences","field3":"Who was first roger moore or sean connery?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"1.6 litre four-stroke turbocharged 90 degree V6 reciprocating","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Since its inception in 1947, Formula One has used a variety of engine regulations. \\"Formulas\\" limiting engine capacity had been used in Grand Prix racing on a regular basis since after World War I. The engine formulae are divided according to era.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFormula One currently uses 1.6 litre four-stroke turbocharged 90 degree V6 reciprocating engines.[1]\\r\\nThe power a Formula One engine produces is generated by operating at a very high rotational speed, up to 15,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).[2] This contrasts with road car engines of a similar size which typically operate at less than 6,000 rpm. The basic configuration of a naturally aspirated Formula One engine had not been greatly modified since the 1967 Cosworth DFV and the mean effective pressure had stayed at around 14 bar MEP.[3] Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal valve springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power loss to drive the camshaft and the valves to the point where the loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm. They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault,[4][5] which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have extremely high spring rate at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss. Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers used pneumatic valve springs with the pressurised air allowing engines to reach speeds of over 20,000?rpm.[5][6][7]\\r\\nFormula One cars use short stroke engines. These engines are common in racing motorcycles and streetbikes.[8] The bore is the diameter of the cylinder in the engine block, and the stroke is the distance the piston travels from top dead-centre (TDC) to bottom dead-centre (BDC) inside the cylinder. To operate at high engine speeds the stroke must be relatively short to prevent catastrophic failure; this is usually connecting rod failure as the rod is under very large stresses at these speeds. Having a short stroke means that a relatively large bore is required to make the 1.6 litre engine displacement. This results in a less efficient combustion stroke, especially at lower rpm.[citation needed] The stroke of a Formula One engine is approximately 39.7?mm (1.56?in), less than half the bore diameter 98.0?mm (3.86?in), what is known as an over-square configuration.\\r\\nIn addition to the use of pneumatic valve springs a Formula One engine's high rpm output has been made possible due to advances in metallurgy and design allowing lighter pistons and connecting rods to withstand the accelerations necessary to attain such high speeds, also by narrowing the connecting rod ends allowing for narrower main bearings. This allows for higher rpm with less bearing-damaging heat build-up. For each stroke, the piston goes from a null speed, to almost two times the mean speed, (approximately 40?m/s) then back to zero. This occurs once for each of the four strokes in the cycle: one Intake (down), one Compression (up), one Power (ignition-down), one Exhaust (up). Maximum piston acceleration occurs at top dead center and is in the region of 95,000?m/s2, about 10,000 times standard gravity or 10,000?g.\\r\\nFormula One engines have come through a variety of regulations, manufacturers and configurations through the years.[9]\\r\\nThis era used pre-war voiturette engine regulations, with 4.5?L atmospheric and 1.5?L supercharged engines. The Indianapolis 500 (which was a round of the World Drivers' Championship from 1950 onwards) used pre-war Grand Prix regulations, with 4.5?L atmospheric and 3.0?L supercharged engines. The power range was up to 425?hp (317?kW), though the BRM Type 15 of 1953 reportedly achieved 600?hp (447?kW) with a 1.5?L supercharged engine.\\r\\nIn 1952 and 1953, the World Drivers' Championship was run to Formula 2 regulations, but the existing Formula One regulations remained in force and a number of Formula One races were still held in those years.\\r\\nEngine size was reduced to 2.5?L. for naturally-aspirated and 750?cc supercharged cars were allowed but no constructor built one for the World Championship. The Indianapolis 500 continued to use old pre-war regulations. The power range was up to 290?hp (216?kW).\\r\\nIntroduced in 1961 amidst some criticism, the new reduced engine 1.5?L formula took control of F1 just as every team and manufacturer switched from front to mid-engined cars. Although these were initially underpowered, five years later average power had increased by nearly 50% and lap times were better than in 1960. The old 2.5?L formula had been retained for International Formula racing, but this didn't achieve much success until the introduction of the Tasman Series in Australia and New Zealand during the winter season, leaving the 1.5?L cars as the fastest single seaters in Europe during this time. The power range was between 150?hp (112?kW) and 225?hp (168?kW).\\r\\nIn 1966, with sports cars capable of outrunning Formula 1 cars thanks to much larger and more powerful engines, the FIA increased engine capacity to 3.0?L atmospheric and 1.5 L compressed engines. Although a few manufacturers had been clamouring for bigger engines, the transition wasn't smooth and 1966 was a transitional year, with 2.0 L versions of the BRM and Coventry-Climax V8 engines being used by several entrants. The appearance of the standard-produced Cosworth DFV in 1967 made it possible for small manufacturers to join the series with a chassis designed in-house. Compression devices were allowed for the first time since 1960, but it wasn't until 1977 that a company actually had the finance and interest of building one, when Renault debuted their new Gordini V6 Turbo at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone that year. In 1980 Renault proved that turbocharging was the way to go in order to stay competitive in Formula One (particularly at high-altitude circuits like Kyalami in South Africa and Interlagos in Brazil); this engine had a considerable power advantage against the Ford-Cosworth DFV, Ferrari and Alfa Romeo naturally aspirated engines. Following this, Ferrari introduced their all-new turbocharged engine in 1981. Following these developments, Brabham owner Bernie Ecclestone managed to get BMW to make the team turbocharged inline-4 engines from 1982 onwards. And in 1983, Alfa Romeo made a turbocharged V8 engine, and in the same year and following years, Honda, Porsche (badged as TAG), Ford-Cosworth and other smaller companies made turbo-charged engines, mostly twin-turbocharged V6's. By the midpoint of 1985, every competing team had a turbocharged engine in their car. By 1986, power figures were reaching unprecedented levels, with all engines reaching over 1,000?hp during qualifying with unrestricted turbo boost pressures; This was especially seen with the BMW engines of Benetton's cars, reaching around 1,350?hp at a 5.5 bar boost pressure during qualifying. However, these engines & gearboxes were very unreliable because of the engine's immense power, and would only last about four laps. For the race, the turbocharger's boost was restricted to ensure engine reliability; But, the engines still produced 850 - 1000?hp during the race. The power range from 1966 to 1986 was between 285?hp (210?kW) to 500?hp (370?kW), turbos 500?hp (370?kW) to 900?hp (670?kW) in race, in qualifying up to 1,350?hp (1,010?kW). Following their experiences at Indianapolis, in 1971 Lotus made a few unsuccessful experiments with a Pratt & Whitney turbine fitted to chassis which had also 4WD.\\r\\nFollowing the turbo domination, forced induction was allowed for two seasons before its eventual ban. The FIA regulations limited boost pressure, to 4 bar in qualifying in 1987 for 1.5?L turbo; and allowed a bigger 3.5?L formula. These seasons were still dominated by turbocharged engines, the Honda RA167E V6 supplying Nelson Piquet winning the 1987 Formula One season on a Williams also winning the constructors championship, followed by TAG-Porsche P01 V6 in McLaren then Honda again with the previous RA166E for Lotus then Ferrari's own 033D V6.\\r\\nThe rest of the grid was powered by the Ford GBA V6 turbo with Benetton, then the only naturally aspirated engine, the DFV-derived Ford Cosworth DFZ 3.5?L V8 outputting 575?hp (429?kW) in Tyrrell, Lola, AGS, March and Coloni.[10] The BMW M12/13 inline four was found in Brabhams BT55 tilted almost horizontally, and in upright position under the Megatron brand in Arrows and Ligier, producing 900?bhp (670?kW) at 3.8 bar in race.[11] Zakspeed was building its own turbo inline four, Alfa Romeo was to power the Ligiers with an inline four but the deal fell through after initial testing had been carried out. Alfa was still represented by its old 890T V8 used by Osella, and Minardi was powered by a Motori Moderni V6.\\r\\nThe 1988 Formula One season was again dominated by turbocharged engines limited to 2.5 bar and Honda with its RA168E turbo V6 producing 640?hp (477?kW) at 12500 rpm in qualifying, this time with McLaren drivers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost winning all the grands prix except one won by Ferrari with its 033E V6 with about 650?hp (485?kW) at 12800 rpm in qualifying. Just behind, Ford introduced its DFR 3.5?L V8 producing 620?hp (462?kW) at 11000 rpm for Benetton, and the 640?hp (477?kW) Megatron BMW M12/13 was still powering Arrows ahead of the Lotus-Honda. Judd introduced its 600?hp (447?kW) CV 3.5?L V8 for March, Williams and Ligier, and the rest of the grid was mainly using previous year's Ford 590?hp (440?kW) Cosworth DFZ except Zakspeed with their own 640?hp (477?kW) engine and the 700?hp (522?kW) Alfa-Romeo V8 turbo for Osella.\\r\\nTurbochargers were banned from the 1989 Formula One season, leaving only a naturally aspirated 3.5?L formula. Honda was still dominant with their RA109E 72 V10 giving 675?hp (503?kW) at 13000 rpm on McLaren cars, enabling Prost to win the championship in front of his teammate Senna. Behind were the Renault RS01 powered Williams, a 67 V10 giving 650?hp (485?kW) at 14300 rpm. Ferrari with its 035/5 65 V12 giving 660?hp (492?kW) at 13,000 rpm. Behind, the grid was powered mainly by Ford Cosworth DFR V8 giving 620?hp (462?kW) at 10,750 rpm except for a few Judd CV V8 in Lotus, Brabham and EuroBrun cars, and two oddballs: the 620?hp (460?kW) Lamborghini 3512 80 V12 powering Lola, and the 560?hp (420?kW) Yamaha OX88 75 V8 in Zakspeed cars. Ford started to try its new design, the 75 V8 HBA 1 with Benetton.\\r\\nThe 1990 Formula One season was again dominated by Honda in McLarens with the 690?hp (515?kW) at 13000 rpm RA100E powering Ayrton Senna and Gerhard Berger ahead of the 680?hp (507?kW) at 12750 rpm Ferrari Tipo 036 of Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell. Behind them the Ford HBA4 for Benetton and Renault RS2 for Williams with 660?hp (492?kW) at 12,800 rpm were leading the pack powered by Ford DFR and Judd CV engines. The exceptions were the better Lamborghini 3512 in Lola and Lotus, and the new Judd EV 76 V8 giving 640?hp (477?kW) at 12,500 rpm in Leyton House and Brabham cars. The two new contenders were the Life which built for themselves an F35 W12 with three four cylinders banks at 60, and Subaru giving Coloni a 1235 flat 12 from Motori Moderni\\r\\nHonda was still leading the 1991 Formula One season in Senna's McLaren with a 710?hp (529?kW) at 13,000 rpm 60 V12 RA121E, just ahead of the Renault RS3 powered Williams benefiting from 700?hp (520?kW) at 12,500 rpm. Ferrari was behind with its Tipo 037, a new 65 V12 giving 710?hp (529?kW) at 13,800 rpm also powering Minardi, just ahead the Ford HBA4/5/6 in Benetton and Jordan cars. Behind, Tyrrell was using the previous Honda RA109E, Judd introduced its new GV with Dallara leaving the previous EV to Lotus, Yamaha were giving its 660?hp (492?kW) OX99 70 V12 to Brabham, Lamborghini engines were used by Modena and Ligier. Ilmor introduced its LH10, a 680?hp (507?kW) at 13000 rpm V10 which eventually became the Mercedes with Leyton House and Porsche sourced a little successful 3512 V12 to Footwork Arrows; the rest of the field was Ford DFR powered.\\r\\nBy the end of the 1994 season, Ferrari's 043 was putting out 820?hp (611?kW) at 15,800 rpm.[12]\\r\\nThis era used a 3.0?L formula, with a power range between 650?hp (485?kW) and 950?hp (708?kW). Renault was the dominant engine supplier between 1991 and 1997, winning five world championships with Williams and Benetton. From 1998 to 2000 it was Mercedes power that ruled giving Mika H?kkinen two world championships. Ferrari gradually got better with their engine. For 1996, they changed from their traditional V12 engine to a smaller and lighter V10 engine. They preferred reliability to power, losing out to Mercedes in terms of outright power initially. At the 1998 Japanese GP, Ferrari's 047D engine spec was said to produce over 800?bhp (600?kW). From 2000 they were never short of power or reliability.\\r\\nBMW started supplying their engines to Williams from 2000. In the first season, the engine was very reliable though slightly short of power compared to Ferrari and Mercedes units. BMW went straight forward with its engine development. The P81, used during the 2001 season, was able to hit 17,810 rpm. Unfortunately reliability was a big issue with several blowups during the season.\\r\\nThe BMW P82, the engine used by the BMW WilliamsF1 Team in 2002, had hit a peak speed of 19,050 revolutions a minute in its final evolutionary stage. It was also the first engine in the 3.0 litre V10-era to break through the 19,000 rpm-wall, during the 2002 Italian Grand Prix's qualifying.[13] BMW's P83 engine used in 2003 season managed an impressive 19,200 rpm and cleared the 900?bhp (670?kW) mark and weighs less than 200?lb (91?kg).[14]\\r\\nIn 2005, the 3.0?L V10 engine was permitted no more than 5 valves per cylinder.[15] Also, the FIA introduced new regulations limiting each car to one engine per two Grand Prix weekends, putting the emphasis on increased reliability and decreased power output. BMW and Mercedes engines had about 930?bhp (690?kW) in this season. Renault, Honda, Toyota and Ferrari had about 900?bhp (670?kW).\\r\\nFor 2006, the engines had to be 90 V8 of 2.4 litres maximum capacity with a 98?mm (3.9?in) maximum circular bore,[clarification needed] which implies a 39.8?mm (1.57?in) stroke at maximum bore. They had to have two circular inlet and exhaust valves per cylinder,[clarification needed] be normally aspirated and have a 95?kg (209?lb) minimum weight. The previous year's engines with a rev-limiter were permitted for 2006 and 2007 for teams who were unable to acquire a V8 engine, with Scuderia Toro Rosso using a Cosworth V10, after Red Bull's takeover of the former Minardi team did not include the new engines.[16]\\r\\nPre-cooling air before it enters the cylinders, injection of any substance other than air and fuel into the cylinders, variable-geometry intake and exhaust systems, and variable valve timing were forbidden. Each cylinder could have only one fuel injector and a single plug spark ignition. Separate starting devices were used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. The crankcase and cylinder block had to be made of cast or wrought aluminium alloys. The crankshaft and camshafts had to be made from an iron alloy, pistons from an aluminium alloy and valves from alloys based on iron, nickel, cobalt or titanium. These restrictions were in place to reduce development costs on the engines.[17]\\r\\nThe reduction in capacity was designed to give a power reduction of around 20% from the three litre engines, to reduce the increasing speeds of Formula One cars. Despite this, in many cases, performance of the car improved. In 2006 Toyota F1 announced an approximate 740?hp (552?kW) output at 18000 rpm for its new RVX-06 engine,[18] but real figures are of course difficult to obtain.\\r\\nThe engine specification was frozen in 2007 to keep development costs down. The engines which were used in the 2006 Japanese Grand Prix were used for the 2007 and 2008 seasons and they were limited to 19,000 rpm. In 2009 the limit was reduced to 18,000 rpm with each driver allowed to use a maximum of 8 engines over the season. Any driver needing an additional engine is penalised 10 places on the starting grid for the first race the engine is used. This increases the importance of reliability, although the effect is only seen towards the end of the season. Certain design changes intended to improve engine reliability may be carried out with permission from the FIA. This has led to some engine manufacturers, notably Ferrari and Mercedes, exploiting this ability by making design changes which not only improve reliability, but also boost engine power output as a side effect. As the Mercedes engine was proven to be the strongest, re-equalisations of engines were allowed by the FIA to allow other manufacturers to match the power.[19]\\r\\n2009 saw the exit of Honda from Formula 1. The team was acquired by Ross Brawn, creating Brawn GP and the BGP 001. With the absence of the Honda engine, Brawn GP retrofitted the Mercedes engine to the BGP 001 chassis. The newly branded team won both the Constructors' Championship and the Drivers' Championship from better-known and better-established contenders Ferrari, McLaren-Mercedes, and Renault.\\r\\nCosworth, absent since the 2006 season, returned in 2010. New teams Lotus Racing, HRT, and Virgin Racing, along with the established Williams, used this engine. The season also saw the withdrawal of the BMW and Toyota engines, as the car companies withdrew from Formula One due to the recession.[20]\\r\\nIn 2009, constructors were allowed to use kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS), also called regenerative brakes. Energy can either be stored as mechanical energy (as in a flywheel) or as electrical energy (as in a battery or supercapacitor), with a maximum power of 81?hp (60?kW; 82 PS). Four teams used it at some point in the season: Ferrari, Renault, BMW, and McLaren.\\r\\nAlthough KERS was still legal in F1 in the 2010 season, all the teams agreed not to use it. KERS returned for the 2011 season, when only three teams elected not to use it. For the 2012 season, only Marussia and HRT raced without KERS, and in 2013 all teams on the grid had KERS. From 2010 to 2013 cars have a regular power of 700-800?hp.\\r\\nThe FIA announced the intention to change the 2.4-litre V8 engines to 1.6 litre V6 turbo engines for the 2014 season. The new regulations include multiple energy recovery systems [21] and fuel flow restrictions, to attract more commercial partners.\\r\\nThe new formula reintroduced turbocharged engines, which last appeared in 1988. These have their efficiency improved by turbo-compounding and introduce more energy recovery systems ÿ with power to be harvested from the brakes and exhaust gases.[22] The original proposal for four-cylinder turbocharged engines was not welcomed by the racing teams, in particular Ferrari. Adrian Newey stated during the 2011 European Grand Prix that the change to a V6 enables teams to carry the engine as a stressed member, whereas an inline 4 would have required a space frame. A compromise was reached to adopt V6 turbocharged engines instead.[22] The internal combustion engines are limited to 15,000 rpm, but rarely exceed 12,000 rpm during Grand Prix due to the new reliability and fuel flow restrictions.[23]\\r\\nEnergy recovery systems were allowed to have a maximum power of 120?kW (160?bhp) and 2 megajoules per lap. KERS was renamed Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K). Heat energy recovery systems were also allowed, under the name Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H)\\r\\nThe 2015 season was an improvement on 2014, adding to most engines about 30-50?hp, the Mercedes engine being the most powerful with 870?hp.\\r\\nOf the previous suppliers, only Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault produced engines to the new formula in 2014, whereas Cosworth stopped supplying engines. Honda returned in 2015 with their own engine, partnering McLaren who used Mercedes power for the 2014 season.[24]\\r\\nNote:\\r\\nFigures correct as of the 2017 Italian Grand Prix\\r\\nBold indicates engine manufacturers competing in Formula One in the 2017 season.\\r\\n^ * Built by  Cosworth\\r\\n^ ** Between 1997-2005 built by  Ilmor\\r\\n^ *** Built by  Porsche\\r\\n^ **** The Indianapolis 500 was part of the World Drivers' Championship from 1950 to 1960.\\r\\n^ ***** Built by  Renault\\r\\n* Only Alberto Ascari raced in the 1952 Indianapolis 500 with Ferrari.\\r\\n** Alfa Romeo did not race in the 1950 Indianapolis 500.","field3":"What engine does a f1 car have 2017?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"October 11, 1975","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The first season of Saturday Night Live, an American sketch comedy series, originally aired in the United States on NBC from October 11, 1975 to July 31, 1976.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974, NBC Tonight Show host Johnny Carson requested that the weekend broadcasts of \\"Best of Carson\\" (officially known as The Weekend Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson) come to an end (back then, The Tonight Show was a 90-minute program), so that Carson could take two weeknights off and NBC would thus air those repeats on those nights rather than feed them to affiliates for broadcast on either Saturdays or Sundays. Given Carson's undisputed status as the king of late-night television, NBC heard his request as an ultimatum, fearing he might use the issue as grounds to defect to either ABC or CBS. To fill the gap, the network drew up some ideas and brought in Dick Ebersol ÿ a protg of legendary ABC Sports president Roone Arledge ÿ to develop a 90-minute late-night variety show. Ebersol's first order of business was hiring a young Canadian producer named Lorne Michaels to be the show-runner.[1]\\r\\nTelevision production in New York was already in decline in the mid-1970s (The Tonight Show had departed for Los Angeles two years prior), so NBC decided to base the show at their studios in Rockefeller Center to offset the overhead of maintaining those facilities. Michaels was given Studio 8H, a converted radio studio that prior to that point was most famous for having hosted Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra from 1937 to 1951, but was being used largely for network election coverage by the mid-1970s.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen the first show aired on October 11, 1975 with George Carlin as its host, it was called NBC's Saturday Night because ABC featured a program at the same time titled Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell. After ABC cancelled the Cosell program in 1976, the NBC program changed its name to Saturday Night Live on March 26, 1977 (and subsequently picked up Bill Murray from Cosell's show in 1977, as well). Every night, Don Pardo introduced the cast, a job he'd hold for 39 years until his death in 2014.\\r\\nThe original concept was for a comedy-variety show featuring young comedians, live musical performances, short films by Albert Brooks, and segments by Jim Henson featuring atypically adult and abstract characters from the Muppets world. Rather than have one permanent host, Michaels elected to have a different guest host each week. The first episode featured two musical guests (Billy Preston and Janis Ian), and the second episode, hosted by Paul Simon on October 18, was almost entirely a musical variety show with various acts. The Not Ready For Prime Time Players did not appear in this episode at all, other than as the bees with Simon telling them they were cancelled, and Chevy Chase in the opening and in \\"Weekend Update\\". Over the course of Season 1, sketch comedy would begin to dominate the show and SNL would more closely resemble its current format.\\r\\nAndy Kaufman made several appearances that were popular with the audience over the season,[citation needed] while The Muppets' Land of Gorch bits were regarded as a poor fit with the rest of the show.[citation needed] The \\"Land Of Gorch\\" sketches were essentially cancelled after episode 10, although the associated Muppet characters still made sporadic appearances after that. After one final appearance at the start of season two, the Muppet characters were permanently dropped from SNL.\\r\\nDuring the season, Michaels appeared on-camera twice, on April 24 and May 22, to make an offer to The Beatles to reunite on the show. In the first appearance, he offered a certified check of $3000. In the second appearance, he increased his offer to $3,200 and free hotel accommodations. John Lennon and Paul McCartney later both admitted that they were watching SNL from Lennon's apartment on May 8, the episode after Michaels' first offer, and briefly toyed with actually going down to the studio, but decided to stay in the apartment because they were too tired.[2][3]\\r\\nThe first cast member hired was Gilda Radner.[4] The rest of the cast included fellow Second City alumni Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, as well as National Lampoon \\"Lemmings\\" alumnus Chevy Chase (whose trademark became his usual falls and opening spiel that cued the show's opening), Jane Curtin, Laraine Newman, and Garrett Morris. The original head writer was Michael O'Donoghue, a writer at National Lampoon who had worked alongside several cast members while directing The National Lampoon Radio Hour. The original theme music was written by future Academy Awardÿwinning composer Howard Shore, who ÿ along with his band (occasionally billed as the \\"All Nurse Band\\" or \\"Band of Angels\\"[citation needed]) ÿ was the original band leader on the show. Paul Shaffer, who would go on to lead David Letterman's band on Late Night and then The Late Show, was also band leader in the early years.

She is portrayed as a half-human half-Klingon born in 2346 on the Federation colony Kessik IV. She was admitted to Starfleet academy but dropped out before graduating. Torres joined the Maquis in 2370 and was serving on the Val Jean when taken to the Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker alien using his station. After being used for medical experiments she was left in an Ocampa colony maintained by the same alien that had abducted the Val Jean. That ship was destroyed in a space battle at the Array and she and what remained of that crew joined the USS Voyager. On the ship she was given field commissioned rank of Lieutenant, junior grade and posted in engineering. In 2371 she was promoted to Chief Engineer. In 2377, she married Tom Paris and gave birth to their daughter Miral at the beginning of the next year, while Voyager was returning to the Alpha Quadrant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Star Trek: Voyager Companion describes B'Elanna as a young half-human half-Klingon in her twenties who is a member of the Maquis Rebellion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe producers wanted to hire an actress who could portray B'Elanna's inner struggle between her human and Klingon halves. After Roxann Dawson read for the role, she became the first of the Voyager actors to be cast.[1] Originally, Dawson's makeup differed from the final design; she explained that she had a much more pronounced Klingon forehead and nose and had to wear a set of Klingon teeth, which made her feel uncomfortable. She asked the producers and makeup artist Michael Westmore if they could perhaps make her more attractive and tone down the Klingon makeup. Eventually they came up with a design with which Roxann was happy, something she described as her \\"beauty monster makeup\\".[2] Although B'Elanna's character was twenty-five years old when the series began, Dawson was actually thirty-six.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nDawson's initial reaction to the script of the first season episode \\"Faces\\" was one of doubt; she felt that it occurred too early in the series and that she did not know the character well enough to play her as two separate people. However, she used the episode to learn more about her character, and it became one of her favorite episodes. When the episode aired, she called her parents to ask their opinions, and they replied, \\"You were good, but the girl that played that Klingon was really great!\\", which Dawson took as a compliment.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the fourth season, Dawson became pregnant with her first child. The writers decided they did not want B'Elanna to be pregnant as well, so for the duration of Dawson's pregnancy, she was given an engineering lab coat, which was used to help cover her growing pregnancy.[4] During the episode \\"The Killing Game\\", the Hirogen had taken over Voyager and forced the crew to participate in holodeck recreations of various combat situations, to which B'Elanna's holodeck character is portrayed as pregnant in World War II with a Nazi officer's child.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the fifth season, Dawson had a meeting with the producers and writers to discuss her character. Roxann explained to them that she felt B'Elanna had an extreme dark side that hadn't been explored, and from that discussion the episode \\"Extreme Risk\\" was created. Dawson stated that after the episode aired she received fan mail praising the issues of depression and inner conflict raised in the episode, with which many people identified.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the sixth season, Dawson got the chance to explore B'Elanna's Klingon heritage thanks to an episode originally conceived by Ronald D. Moore for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. In the episode \\"Barge of the Dead\\", B'Elanna has a near-death experience and travels to Grethor, the Klingon Hell, where she meets her mother Miral. She discovers that because of the dishonor B'Elanna has caused her family, her mother would spend eternity's in Grethor. The episode explores some aspects of B'Elanna's character, and also gives further insight into Klingon mythology. Dawson believed the episode had many layers to it, and she believed it was essentially a coming-of-age story for B'Elanna and her final acceptance of her Klingon heritage.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the seventh season, a pregnancy storyline was written in for B'Elanna's character. Jessica Gaona played the character's young iteration in the episode \\"Lineage\\". At the end of the series, Dawson described B'Elanna's character arc as that of an unruly young woman who matures over the course of seven years.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nB'Elanna is portrayed as having been born in 2346 on the Federation colony Kessik IV. Torres had a troubled childhood; her human father, John Torres, and Klingon mother, Miral, often fought, and her father ultimately left the household when she was twelve years old. When she overheard her father discussing his unhappiness in the home of two Klingons, she attempted to run away. When she confronted him, she bitterly told him to leave. He returned to Earth days later, leaving her to be raised by her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nA mixture of Klingon and human genetics, Torres is shown as prone to aggressive outbursts. She once attacked her schoolmate Daniel Byrd after he repeatedly taunted her, calling her \\"Miss Turtlehead\\" due to her cranial ridges. Torres retained this aggressive behavior throughout her life, but she eventually learned to control it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile in the academy, B'Elanna was constantly having trouble with the rules of Starfleet, resulting in her getting four disciplinary hearings and one suspension. But before dropping out, Torres was a valued member of the academy athletics team, competing as a  decathlete; making the track and field coach furious in addition to the many other professors unhappy with her choice to leave the academy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTorres dropped out of Starfleet Academy in 2365 at age 19. A few years later she became a member of the Maquis renegade group, and began developing a profound hatred of the Cardassians. Torres became associated with a Maquis captain named Chakotay, and was serving as chief engineer on his ship, the Val Jean, when they were brought to the Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring her time with the Maquis, Torres reprogrammed a Cardassian missile known as \\"Dreadnought.\\" The missile, built with artificial intelligence, was originally targeted at Maquis installations. Torres reprogrammed it on a course for a Cardassian installation, but \\"Dreadnought\\" was swept into the Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen both the Voyager crew and the Val Jean crew were taken to the Delta Quadrant, Harry Kim and Torres were transported to the Ocampa home world while their respective crews set out to look for them. Being the only two people from their region of the Alpha Quadrant, the two quickly formed a relationship and she nicknamed him \\"Starfleet\\" for his faith in the Federation and Starfleet. This relationship would carry on throughout the series as the two would more than occasionally work on tasks together, allowing Kim to prove his intelligence to the whole crew.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2371, B'Elanna Torres joined the Voyager crew with the rest of the Maquis from the Val Jean, as Captain Kathryn Janeway offers them the opportunity. She was placed in the engineering department, which had no clear department head because the original chief engineer was killed during the trip to the Delta Quadrant; Captain Janeway promoted Torres to chief engineer based on Voyagers first officer Chakotay's recommendation. Initially, Torres was very outspoken in her disapproval of Captain Janeway's decision to destroy the Caretaker's array, which had the ability to send the Voyager back home from the Delta Quadrant, and carried a small grudge against the captain. Over the first few months, Torres began respecting the captain and her decisions based on Janeway's strong leadership and their shared interest in science.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after becoming chief engineer, Torres disobeys the captain's orders when Voyager encounters a race known as the Sikarians. The Sikarians have advanced transporter technology that could drastically shorten their 70-year journey, but Sikarian law prohibits the Voyager crew from obtaining it legitimately. Torres becomes involved with a small group of officers who obtain the technology on the Sikarian black market and perpetrate a failed attempt to integrate it into Voyager's systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nTorres, along with Tom Paris, was later kidnapped by the Vidiians. A Vidiian scientist extracts the Klingon DNA from Torres, splicing her into two separate people: one human, one Klingon. He believed the Klingon DNA had a specific biochemical property that could lead to a cure for the Phage, a disease affecting his people. The human Torres is portrayed fraught with fear but having strong technical expertise, while the Klingon Torres is shown as aggressive but impatient. After her escape from the Vidiians the Klingon Torres suffered a fatal wound from the Vidiian energy weapon and died, but the Doctor used her DNA to restore the human Torres to her original half-human half-Klingon state.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the episode \\"Persistence of Vision,\\" it is revealed that Torres at the time had a romantic interest in Chakotay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2373, Torres was the target of telepathically inspired dreams from a member of a race called the Enarans. The dreams were actually memories of a great massacre that took place on the Enaran homeworld and were the elder Enaran's method of making sure that the memory of this massacre lives on, even if in the mind of an alien.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater that year, Vulcan engineer Vorik triggered Torres' mating instincts when he forcibly initiated a telepathic bond with her while he is experiencing the pon farr. Torres and Tom Paris later became trapped on a planet together during an away mission, and Torres attempted to get Paris to mate with her, but he resisted. Eventually, Vorik and Torres engaged in ritual battle to purge the blood fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nTorres later began a relationship with Paris after a complicated and stormy courtship. During an incident in 2374, Torres confessed her love to him when they were left floating in space in environmental suits, with almost no hope of rescue (\\"Day of Honor\\"). Although Voyager was soon able to rescue them, Torres realized that her courage in admitting her love had brought her one step closer to discovering what she considered true honor. Their relationship first flourished on screen during \\"Scientific Method.\\" They married in 2377 and their honeymoon was aboard the Delta Flyer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Torres and Paris conceived their child in 2377, she learned from the Doctor that the child would have distinct Klingon cranial ridges as well as other Klingon traits. Torres, remembering painful events from her own childhood, urged the Doctor to perform gene therapy to reduce this phenotype, and even went so far as to reprogram him to do so. Paris and Captain Janeway both disagreed and prevented the Doctor from performing the genetic modifications. When Paris got her to open up, she admitted that she was afraid her husband would find living with two Klingons too difficult and  leave her the way her father did. Once he allayed her fears, he admitted wanting even more children just like their mother, and Torres was shown as finally enjoying the pregnancy (\\"Lineage\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a group of Klingon radicals spent time aboard Voyager (\\"Prophecy\\"), Torres began opening herself to more Klingon beliefs and, for the first time since childhood, was able to pray for her grandmother, L'Naal, and her great-grandmother, Krelik. When communications with Earth became available (\\"Author, Author\\"), she reached out to her estranged father, John Torres.\\r\\n\\r\\nTorres' and Paris' daughter, Miral Paris (named after B'Elanna's mother), was born at the beginning of 2378, during Voyager's trip through a Borg transwarp conduit back to the Alpha Quadrant. In an alternate timeline where Voyager made it home by different means, Miral was shown as an adult serving in Starfleet, with the rank of ensign.\\r\\n\\r\\nTorres Birthdate - On September 2, 2014, the Official Star Trek website published an archive article with information on the press release for the launch of the series. In the document, which includes character biographies, it confirms that when the series began (2371) - \\"B'Elanna is a beautiful 25 year old woman who is half human, half klingon...\\" This information would then place B'Elanna's birthdate at 2346.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Official Star Trek Voyager Companion gives further evidence to Torres' age. This is a passage taken from the book: \\"B'ELANNA TORRES is a half Klingon, half Human in her twenties who is frantically working at the consoles of the barely spaceworthy craft...\\"[8]","field3":"When do tom paris and b'elanna torres get together?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"September 24, 2004","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is a national park that conserves an area of large sand dunes up to 750 feet (229?m) tall[4] on the eastern edge of the San Luis Valley, and an adjacent national preserve located in the Sangre de Cristo Range, in south-central Colorado, United States.[5] The park was originally designated Great Sand Dunes National Monument on March 17, 1932 by President Herbert Hoover. The original boundaries protected an area of 35,528 acres (55.5?sq?mi; 143.8?km2).[6] A boundary change and redesignation as a national park and preserve was authorized on November 22, 2000 and then established by an act of Congress on September 24, 2004.[2] The park encompasses 107,342 acres (167.7?sq?mi; 434.4?km2) while the preserve protects an additional 41,686 acres (65.1?sq?mi; 168.7?km2) for a total of 149,028 acres (232.9?sq?mi; 603.1?km2).[1] The recreational visitor total was 486,935 in 2017, about 25% more than the 388,308 visitors of 2016.[3]\\r\\nThe park contains the tallest sand dunes in North America.[7] The dunes cover an area of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2) and are estimated to contain over 5 billion cubic meters of sand.[8] Sediments from the surrounding mountains filled the valley over geologic time periods. After lakes within the valley receded, exposed sand was blown by the predominant southwest winds toward the Sangre de Cristos, eventually forming the dunefield over an estimated tens of thousands of years.[9] The four primary components of the Great Sand Dunes system are the mountain watershed, the dunefield, the sand sheet, and the sabkha.[8] Ecosystems within the mountain watershed include alpine tundra, subalpine forests, montane woodlands, and riparian zones.[10]\\r\\nEvidence of human habitation in the San Luis Valley dates back about 11,000 years. The first historic peoples to inhabit the area were the Southern Ute Tribe, while Apaches and Navajo also have cultural connections in the dunes area. In the late 17th century, Don Diego de Vargasa Spanish governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mxicobecame the first European on record to enter the San Luis Valley. Juan Bautista de Anza, Zebulon Pike, John C. Frmont, and John Gunnison all travelled through and explored parts of the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. The explorers were soon followed by settlers who ranched, farmed and mined in the valley starting in the late 19th century. The park was first established as a national monument in 1932 to protect it from gold mining and the potential of a concrete manufacturing business.[11]\\r\\nVisitors must walk across the wide and shallow Medano Creek to reach the dunes in spring and summer months. The creek typically has a peak flow from late May to early June in most years. From July through April, the creek is usually no more than a few inches deep, if there is any water at all.[12] Hiking is permitted throughout the dunes with the warning that the sand surface temperature may reach 150?F (66?C) in summer.[13] Sandboarding and sandsledding are popular activities, both done on specially designed equipment which can be rented just outside the park entrance or in Alamosa.[14] Visitors with street-legal four-wheel drive vehicles may continue past the end of the park's main road to Medano Pass on 22 miles (35?km) of unpaved road, crossing the stream bed of Medano Creek nine times and traversing 4 miles (6.4?km) of deep sand.[15] Hunting is permitted in the preserve during the months of autumn, while hunting is prohibited within national park boundaries at all times.[16] The preserve encompasses nearly all of the mountainous areas north and east of the dunefield, up to the ridgeline of the Sangre de Cristos.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area dates back about 11,000 years. Some of the first people to enter the San Luis Valley and the Great Sand Dunes area were nomadic hunter-gatherers whose connection to the area centered around the herds of mammoths and prehistoric bison. They were Stone Age people who hunted with large stone spear or dart points now identified as Clovis and Folsom points. These people only stayed when hunting and plant gathering was good, and avoided the region during times of drought and scarcity.[11]\\r\\nModern American Indian tribes were familiar with the area when Spaniards first arrived in the 17th century. The traditional Ute phrase for the Great Sand Dunes is Saa waap maa nache, \\"sand that moves.\\" Jicarilla Apaches settled in northern New Mexico and called the dunes Sei-anyedi, \\"it goes up and down.\\" Blanca Peak, just southeast of the dunes, is one of the four sacred mountains of the Navajo, who call it Sisnaajini. These various tribes collected the inner layers of bark from ponderosa pine trees for use as food and medicine. The people from the Tewa/Tiwa-speaking pueblos along the Rio Grande remember a traditional site of great importance located in the valley near the dunes: the lake through which their people emerged into the present world. They call the lake Sip'ophe, meaning \\"Sandy Place Lake\\", which is thought to be the springs and/or lakes immediately west of the dunefield.[11]\\r\\nIn 1694, Don Diego de Vargas became the first European known to have entered the San Luis Valley, although herders and hunters from the Spanish colonies in present-day northern New Mexico probably entered the valley as early as 1598. De Vargas and his men hunted a herd of 500 bison in the southern part of the valley before returning to Santa Fe. In 1776, Juan Bautista de Anza and an entourage of men and livestock probably passed near the dunes as they returned from a punitive raid against a group of Comanches. At this time, the valley was a travel route between the High Plains and Santa Fe for Comanches, Utes, and Spanish soldiers. The dunes were likely a visible landmark for travelers along the trail.[11]\\r\\nThe first known writings about Great Sand Dunes appear in Zebulon Pikes journals of 1807. As Lewis and Clarks expedition was returning east, U.S. Army Lt. Pike was commissioned to explore as far west as the Arkansas and Red Rivers. By the end of November 1806, Pike and his men had reached the site of todays Pueblo, Colorado. Still pushing southwest, and confused about the location of the Arkansas River, Pike crossed the Sangre de Cristos just above the Great Sand Dunes.[11]\\r\\nAfter marching some miles, we discovered ... at the foot of the White Mountains [todays Sangre de Cristos] which we were then descending, sandy hillsWhen we encamped, I ascended one of the largest hills of sand, and with my glass could discover a large river [the Rio Grande] The sand-hills extended up and down the foot of the White Mountains about 15 miles, and appeared to be about 5 miles in width. Their appearance was exactly that of the sea in a storm, except as to color, not the least sign of vegetation existing thereon.\\r\\nIn 1848, John C. Frmont was hired to find a railroad route from St. Louis to California. He crossed the Sangre de Cristos into the San Luis Valley in winter, courting disaster but proving that a winter crossing of this range was possible. He was followed in 1853 by Captain John Gunnison of the Corps of Topographical Engineers. Gunnisons party crossed the dunefield on horseback.[11]\\r\\nIn the years that followed, the Rockies were gradually explored, treaties were signed and broken with resident tribes, and people with widely differing goals entered the San Luis Valley from the United States and Mexico. In 1852, Fort Massachusetts was built and then relocated to Fort Garland, about 20 miles southeast of the Great Sand Dunes, to safeguard travel for settlers following the explorers into the valley. Although many settlers arrived via the trails from Santa Fe or La Veta Pass, several routes over the Sangre de Cristos into the valley were well-known to American Indians and increasingly used by settlers in the late 1800s. Medano Pass, also known as Sand Hill Pass, and Mosca Pass, also called Robidouxs Pass, offered more direct routes from the growing front range cities and dropped into the valley just east of the Great Sand Dunes. Trails were improved into wagon routes and eventually into rough roads. The Mosca Pass Toll Road was developed in the 1870s, and stages and the mail route used it regularly through about 1911 when the western portion was damaged in a flash flood. Partially rebuilt at times in the 1930s through the 1950s, the road was repeatedly closed due to flood damage and is now a hiking trail.[11]\\r\\nThe Herard familyafter whom Mount Herard is named[17]established a ranch and homestead along Medano Creek in 1875, using the old Medano Pass Road to travel to and from their home. The modern unpaved road follows the old route and is open only to four-wheel drive, high-clearance vehicles as it passes through deep sand, rises to Medano Pass, and continues east into the Wet Mountain Valley. The Herards grazed and bred cattle in the mountain meadows, raised horses, and established a trout hatchery in the stream. Other families homesteaded near the dunes as well, including the Teofilo Trujillo family whose sheep and cattle ranch in the valley later became part of the MedanoÿZapata Ranch, owned by the Nature Conservancy since 1999. The Trujillo's extant homestead and the ruins of a destroyed one were declared a National Historic Landmark in 2004.[18] Frank and Virginia Wellington built a cabin and hand-dug the irrigation ditch that parallels Wellington Ditch Trail located south of the park campground.[11]\\r\\nGold and silver rushes occurred around the Rockies after 1853, bringing miners by the thousands into the state and stimulating mining businesses that are still in operation. Numerous small strikes occurred in the mountains around the San Luis Valley. People had frequently speculated that gold might be present in the Great Sand Dunes, and local newspapers ran articles in the 1920s estimating its worth at anywhere from 17 cents/ton to $3/ton. Active placer mining operations sprang up along Medano Creek, and in 1932 the Volcanic Mining Company established a gold mill designed to recover gold from the sand. Although minute quantities of gold were recovered, the technique was too labor-intensive, the stream too seasonal, and the pay-out too small to support any business for long.[11]\\r\\nThe idea that the dunes could be destroyed by gold mining or concrete manufacturing alarmed residents of Alamosa and Monte Vista. By the 1920s, the dunes had become a source of pride for local people, and a potential source of tourist dollars for local businesses. Members of the P.E.O. Sisterhood sponsored a bill to Congress asking for national monument status for Great Sand Dunes. Widely supported by local people, the bill was signed into law in 1932 by President Herbert Hoover. Similar support in the late 1990s resulted in the monuments expansion into a national park and preserve in 2000-2004.[11]\\r\\nThe park contains the tallest sand dunes in North America,[7] rising to a maximum height of 750 feet (229?m)[4] from the floor of the San Luis Valley on the western base of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The dunes cover an area of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2) and are estimated to contain over 5 billion cubic meters of sand.[8]\\r\\nCreation of the San Luis Valley began when the Sangre de Cristo Range was uplifted in the rotation of a large tectonic plate. The San Juan Mountains to the west of the valley were created through extended and dramatic volcanic activity. The San Luis Valley encompasses the area between the two mountain ranges and is roughly the size of the state of Connecticut. Sediments from both mountain ranges filled the deep chasm of the valley, along with huge amounts of water from melting glaciers and rain. The presence of larger rocks along Medano Creek at the base of the dunes, elsewhere on the valley floor, and in buried deposits indicates that some of the sediment has been washed down in torrential flash floods.[9]\\r\\nIn 2002, geologists discovered lakebed deposits on hills in the southern part of the valley, confirming theories of a huge lake that once covered much of the San Luis Valley floor. The body of water was named Lake Alamosa after the largest town in the valley. Lake Alamosa suddenly receded after its extreme water pressure broke through volcanic deposits in the southern end of the valley. The water then drained through the Rio Grande, likely forming the steep Rio Grande Gorge near Taos, New Mexico. Smaller lakes still covered the valley floor, including two broad lakes in the northeastern side of the valley. Large amounts of sediment from the volcanic San Juan Mountains continued to wash down into these lakes, along with some sand from the Sangre de Cristo Range. Dramatic natural climate change later significantly reduced these lakes, leaving behind the sand sheet. Remnants of these lakes still exist in the form of sabkha wetlands.[9]\\r\\nSand that was left behind after the lakes receded blew with the predominant southwest winds toward a low curve in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The wind funnels toward three mountain passesMosca, Medano, and Music Passesand the sand accumulates in this natural pocket. The winds blow from the valley floor toward the mountains, but during storms the winds blow back toward the valley. These opposing wind directions cause the dunes to grow vertically. Two mountain streamsMedano and Sand Creeksalso capture sand from the mountain side of the dunefield and carry it around the dunes and back to the valley floor. The creeks then disappear into the sand sheet, and the sand blows back into the dunefield. Barchan and transverse dunes form near these creeks. The combination of opposing winds, a huge supply of sand from the valley floor, and the sand recycling action of the creeks, are all part of the reason that these are the tallest dunes in North America.[9]\\r\\nSufficient vegetation has grown on the valley floor that there is little sand blowing into the main dunefield from the valley; however, small parabolic dunes continue to originate in the sand sheet and migrate across grasslands, joining the main dunefield. Some of these migrating dunes become covered by grasses and shrubs and stop migrating. The dunes system is fairly stable as the opposing wind directions balance each other out over time. Also, the main dunefield is moist beneath a thin layer of dry surface sand. While the top few inches of sand are blown around during windstorms, the moist sand remains largely in place.[9]\\r\\nScientists estimate that Lake Alamosa disappeared about 440,000 years ago, but the dunes themselves apparently originate from sand deposits from later, smaller lakes. A relatively new dating process, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is still in development. This method takes core samples of sand from deep within a dune, and attempts to measure how long quartz grains have been buried in the dark. If the deepest sand deposits can be accurately dated, the age of the dunes could be determined. Samples of sand from deep in the dunes have returned OSL dates varying between a few hundred years to tens of thousands of years old. The oldest dated deposits found so far would have accumulated in the late Pleistocene epoch, during the middle years of the current ice age's third stage.[9]\\r\\nThe dunes contain dark areas which are deposits of magnetite, a mineral that has eroded out of the Sangre de Cristo Range. Magnetite is both attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a magnet itself; it is the most magnetic mineral in nature.[19] Magnetite is an oxide of iron which is heavier than the surrounding particles of sand. When overlying sand is removed by wind, magnetite deposits stay in place and are visible as dark patches in the dunefield.[20]\\r\\nGreat Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is located in Saguache and Alamosa Counties, Colorado at approximately 37.75 north latitude and 105.5 west longitude. The national park is located in the San Luis Valley while the national preserve is located to the east in an adjacent section of the Sangre de Cristo Range of the Rocky Mountains.[5] Elevations range from 7,515?ft (2,291?m) in the valley west of the dunes, to 13,604?ft (4,146?m) at the summit of Tijeras Peak in the northern part of the preserve.[21][10]\\r\\nThe dunes cover an area of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2) while the surrounding relatively flat sand sheet which feeds the large dunes is actually the largest component of the entire dunes system, containing about 90% of all the sand in the park.[8] The forested and often snowcapped mountains exceeding 13,000?ft (4,000?m) to the east are the most prominent feature, towering over the high dunes. Other features include snow-fed creeks originating high in the mountains, and several alpine lakes. Two spring-fed creeks in the sand sheet along with a few small lakes in the valley's sabkha section southwest of the dunes create a wetland that nurtures wildlife.[10]\\r\\nThe main dunefield measures roughly 4?mi (6.4?km) east-to-west and 6?mi (9.7?km) north-to-south, with an adjacent 6?sq?mi (16?km2) area to the northwest called the Star Dune Complex, for a total of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2). The park and preserve together are approximately 15?mi (24?km) east-to-west at the widest point, and approximately 15?mi (24?km) north-to-south, also at the widest point.[5] The park encompasses 107,342 acres (167.7?sq?mi; 434.4?km2), while the preserve protects an additional 41,686 acres (65.1?sq?mi; 168.7?km2) for a total of 149,028 acres (232.9?sq?mi; 603.1?km2).[1]\\r\\nThe Rio Grande National Forest is located to the north and southeast while the remaining forested slopes directly to the east of the dunes were redesignated the Great Sand Dunes National Preserve. The San Isabel National Forest is located to the east of the preserve just beyond the ridge of the Sangre de Cristo Range. Private property abuts most of the southern boundary of the park. The San Luis Lakes State Wildlife Area lies adjacent to the southwestern corner of the park, while the Rio Grande flows through the valley farther to the southwest. The Baca National Wildlife Refuge lies adjacent to the west, and the slopes of the San Juan Mountains begin at the western edge of the valley. Private property of the Baca Grande subdivision of Crestone lies adjacent to the northwest.[5]\\r\\nThe nearest city is Alamosa which is about 30?mi (48?km) away by road to the southwest.[22][23] The nearest towns are Crestone to the north, Mosca and Hooper to the west, Blanca and Fort Garland to the south, and Gardner to the east. Colorado Springs and Denver are located a few hours away by car to the northeast.[23] The major roads through the San Luis Valley are U.S. Route 160 on an eastÿwest alignment passing south of the park, and U.S. Route 285 on a northÿsouth alignment passing west of the park and generally parallel to Colorado State Highway 17, which is the closer of the two northÿsouth roadways.[23]\\r\\nThe Great Sand Dunes are located in the high elevation desert of the San Luis Valley, just west of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The summer high temperatures are atypical for a desert area as the average high temperature is only slightly above 80?F (27?C) in the warmest month of July; however, the large spread between high and low temperatures is typical of a high desert climate. Low temperatures during winter nights can be extremely cold, with average low temperatures well below 32?F (0?C) and record low temperatures below 0?F (?18?C) from November through April.[24] Precipitation is very low on the dunes, averaging just 11.13 inches (283?mm) of rainfall per year.[25] The high evaporation rates on the dunes qualify the area as a desert, even though precipitation exceeds 10 inches (250?mm).\\r\\nSpring can sometimes bring high winds, mainly in the afternoon. Spring conditions vary greatly, from mild and sunny to cold and snowy. March is the snowiest month of the year, though some days are above 50?F (10?C). In late spring, when Medano Creek usually has its peak flow, snow or high winds are still possible. In summer, daytime high temperatures average 75ÿ80?F (24ÿ27?C); however, sand surface temperatures can soar to 150?F (66?C) on sunny afternoons. Summer nights are coolthe park is located 8,200?ft (2,500?m) above sea levelwith nighttime temperatures often dropping below 50?F (10?C). Afternoon thundershowers are common in July and August with cool winds, heavy rain and lightning. Fall is generally mild, with Indian summer days when temperatures reach 60?F (16?C) and higher, but chilly nights below freezing. Occasional fall storms bring icy rain or snow. Cold temperatures well below freezing are typical in winter, although the sunshine is generally abundant and the dry air doesn't feel as cold as more humid areas. The average winter high temperatures are just above freezing even in January, which is the coldest month of the year.[26]\\r\\nThe four primary components of the Great Sand Dunes system are the mountain watershed, the dunefield, the sand sheet, and the sabkha. The mountain watershed receives heavy snow and rain which feeds creeks that flow down from alpine tundra and lakes, through subalpine and montane woodlands, and finally around the main dunefield. Sand that has blown from the valley floor is captured in streams and carried back toward the valley. As creeks disappear into the valley floor, the sand is picked up and carried to the dunefield once again. The recycling action of water and wind, along with a 7% moisture content below the dry surface holding the sand together, contributes to the great height of the dunes.[8]\\r\\nThe dunefield is composed of reversing dunes, transverse dunesalso called crescentic or barchan dunesand star dunes. The sand sheet is the largest component of the system, comprising sandy grasslands that extend around three sides of the dunefield. Almost 90% of the sand deposit is found in the sand sheet, while the remainder is found in the dunefield. Small parabolic dunes form in the sand sheet and then migrate into the main dunefield. Nabkha dunes form around vegetation. The sabkha forms where sand is seasonally saturated by rising ground water. When the water evaporates away in late summer, minerals similar to baking soda cement sand grains together into a hard, white crust. Areas of sabkha can be found throughout western portions of the sand sheet, wherever the water table meets the surface. Some wetlands in the sabkha are deeper with plentiful plants and animals, while others are shallow and salty.[8]\\r\\nThere are hundreds of plant species in the park and preserve, adapted for environments as diverse as alpine tundra and warm water wetlands. Trees include aspen, Douglas fir, pinyon pine, ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, three-leaf sumac, bristlecone pine, red osier dogwood, and narrow-leaf cottonwood.[27][28]\\r\\nAmong the flowering plants are alpine phlox, dwarf clover, alpine forget-me-not, fairy primrose, alpine aven, Indian paintbrush, lousewort, blue-purple penstemon, aspen daisy, western paintbrush, elephantella, snow buttercups, scurfpea, Indian ricegrass, blowout grass, prairie sunflower, Rocky Mountain beeplant, rubber rabbitbrush, speargrass, small-flowered sand verbena, narrowleaf yucca, prickly pear cactus, Rocky Mountain iris, and white water buttercup.[27][28]\\r\\nInland saltgrass is the primary type of grass around sabkha wetlands in the park.[27]\\r\\nMammals includefrom alpine tundra to low elevation grasslandsthe pika, yellow-bellied marmot, bighorn sheep, black bear, snowshoe hare, Abert's squirrel, cougar, mule deer, water shrew, beaver, kangaroo rat, badger, pronghorn, and elk. Over 1500 bison are currently ranched within park boundaries on private land owned by The Nature Conservancy which is only open to the public through tours.[29]\\r\\nOver 200 species of birds are found throughout the park. From higher to lower elevations and dependent on season, some of the bird species include the brown-capped rosy finch, white-tailed ptarmigan, red-breasted nuthatch, peregrine falcon, mountain bluebird, northern pygmy owl, dusky grouse, hummingbird (four species), western tanager, burrowing owl, bald eagle, golden eagle, sandhill crane, American avocet, and great blue heron.[30]\\r\\nVarious reptiles live in the park, such as the short-horned lizard, fence lizard, many-lined skink, bullsnake, and garter snake.[31]\\r\\nFish living in the park's streams include the Rio Grande cutthroat trout, Rio Grande sucker (Catostomus plebeius), and fathead minnow.[32]\\r\\nAmphibians include the tiger salamander, chorus frog, northern leopard frog, spadefoot toad, Great Plains toad, and Woodhouse's toad.[33]\\r\\nThe park harbors several endemic insects including the Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle, a circus beetle (Eleodes hirtipennis), Werner's (Amblyderus werneri) and Triplehorn's (Amblyderus triplehorni) ant-like flower beetle, as well as undescribed species of clown beetle, noctuid moth, and robber fly. More than a thousand different kinds of arthropods have been found at the Great Sand Dunes.[34]\\r\\nAlpine tundra is the highest elevation ecosystem at Great Sand Dunes where the conditions are too harsh for trees to survive, but wildflowers, pikas, yellow-bellied marmots, ptarmigans, and bighorn sheep thrive. The tundra begins about 11,700?ft (3,600?m) and continues upward to the highest peaks in the park. At subalpine elevations near the tree line grow krummholz (meaning \\"crooked wood\\")trees which are stunted and twisted due to high winds, snow, ice, short growing seasons, and shallow, poorly developed soils. The transition zone between subalpine forest and alpine tundra is an important refuge during storms for some mammals and birds who primarily live on tundra. Bristlecone and limber pines grow at an extremely slow rate, with small statures that belie their true ages as some are more than a thousand years old.[10]\\r\\nSubalpine forests and meadows capture heavy snow in winter and soaking rains in summer. The highest diversity of Rocky Mountain species of plants and animals are found in this ecosystem. Subalpine forest extends from 9,500?ft (2,900?m) to tree line at 11,700?ft (3,600?m). Montane forests and woodlands are found along the drier foothills at approximately 8,000?ft (2,400?m) to 9,500?ft (2,900?m). Pinyon-juniper and ponderosa pine woodlands are found on open, drier slopes, while cottonwood and aspen trees are in drainages. Cougars hunt mule deer here at night. Owls, dusky grouse, turkeys, and bullsnakes all find habitat in these drier, open woodlands.[10]\\r\\nThe riparian zone follows creeks through the subalpine and montane ecosystems at Great Sand Dunes. Cottonwood and aspen trees, red osier dogwood, and alder grow well in this wet environment, in turn providing shade and habitat for black bears, water shrews, and western tanagers. Rio Grande cutthroat trout are found in Medano Creek.[10]\\r\\nWhile the top few inches of the dunefield are often dry, the dunes are moist year-round due to ongoing precipitation. Moisture content of 7% beneath the surface sand allows species such as Ord's kangaroo rat, Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle, scurfpea, and blowout grass to survive here. Many animals visit the dunes from other habitats, including elk, pronghorn, bison, coyotes, bobcats, and raptors.[10]\\r\\nThe sand sheet includes extensive grasslands and shrublands that surround the dunefield on three sides, from 7,500?ft (2,300?m) to 8,200?ft (2,500?m). The sand sheet varies from wet meadows to cool-grass prairie to desert shrubland, depending on proximity to groundwater and soil type. Elk and pronghorn are common, while burrowing owls nest in the ground and other raptors float through the skies searching for mice, kangaroo rats, and short-horned lizards.[10]\\r\\nThe sabkha is a wetland region where groundwater rises and falls seasonally, leaving white alkali deposits on the surface. Inland saltgrass is common in this area. Toads can reproduce in sabkha wetlands when they are seasonally filled with sufficient fresh water. Shore birds such as the American avocet hunt tadpoles and insects in the shallow water. Wetlands speckle the San Luis Valley and are important habitat for sandhill cranes, shore birds, amphibians, dragonflies, and freshwater shrimp. Grassland species such as elk also use these waters for drinking. The sabkha and wetlands are at approximately 7,500?ft (2,300?m) in elevation.[10]\\r\\nThe park preserves the tallest sand dunes in North America,[7] as well as alpine lakes and tundra, mountain peaks over 13,000 feet (3,962 m) in elevation, mixed conifer forests, grasslands, and wetlands.[35]\\r\\nMedano Creek, which borders the east side of the dunes, never finds a permanent and stable streambed as fresh sand falls in the creek. Small underwater sand ridges that act like dams form and break down, creating surges of water which resemble waves. The surges occur at an average interval of about 20 seconds. In a high-water year, the surges can be as high as 20?in (51?cm). The \\"surge flow\\" mainly occurs during the peak flow period from late May to early June in most years.[12]\\r\\nBig Spring Creek is a unique spring-fed creek formed by an unconfined aquifer which creates wetlands that support rare species and plant communities in a generally arid area. The creek was designated a National Natural Landmark in 2012.[36]\\r\\nAccessing the dunes requires walking across the wide and shallow Medano Creek. The creek typically flows past the main dunes parking area from late April through late June, with peak flow occurring from late May to early June in most years. In other months, the creek is usually only a few inches deep, if there is any water at all.[12] Hiking is permitted throughout the dunes, with the warning that the sand can get very hot in the summer, up to 150?F (66?C).[13] Sand wheelchairs are available at the visitor center.[37] Sandboards and sand sleds can be rented just outside the park entrance or in Alamosa which is the closest city.[14]\\r\\nMosca Pass Trail is a 7?mi (11?km) roundtrip hike that follows a small creek through aspen and evergreen forests to Mosca Passelevation 9,737?ft (2,968?m)[5]in the Sangre de Cristo Range. American Indians and early settlers used this route for travel between the San Luis Valley and the Wet Mountain Valley to the east. Several trails located in the northeastern section of the park lead to alpine lakes high in the mountains. A trail to Medano Lake and the summit of Mount Herard is located off Medano Pass Road. A trail along Sand Creek leads to the Sand Creek Lakes and Music Passelevation 11,380?ft (3,470?m)[5]with a view of the Upper Sand Creek basin. Spur trails along Sand Creek lead to the four alpine lakes which feed the creek, and to several 13,000?ft (4,000?m) peaks above the basin. The Sand Ramp Trail traverses between the dunefield and the mountains, connecting the park's campground to Medano Pass Road (follow the road up to Medano Lake and Pass), as well as the base of the Sand Creek Trail.[13][5] Most of the park's grasslands, shrublands and wetlands have no established trails but are generally open to hiking. The Nature Conservancy's Medano Ranch property may only be visited on a guided tour. A fence surrounds the property to contain the Conservancy's bison herd and demarcate the boundaries.[38]\\r\\nMedano Pass Road is a 22?mi (35?km) four-wheel drive (4WD) road that begins where the main park road ends.[39] The unpaved road crosses Medano Creek nine times and traverses 4?mi (6.4?km) of deep sand. Only street-licensed 4WD motor vehicles or motorcycles, and bicycles are permitted.[15] Fat tire bikes are the only type of bicycle recommended by the park service due to the deep sandy stretches.[40] The road winds around the eastern side of the dunefield, up through a forested mountain canyon inside the National Preserve, and then over Medano Passelevation 9,982?ft (3,043?m)[5]at the 11.2?mi (18.0?km) mark. The road then continues down into the Wet Mountain Valley and connects with Colorado State Highway 69. Travellers are advised that hunting is permitted in the National Preserve during the months of autumn.[15]\\r\\nMost of the national park and the entire national preserve are open to horseback riding and pack animals. Prohibited zones include all developed areassuch as the Pinyon Flats campground, picnic areas, and the visitor centerall paved roadways and many of the hiking trails, along with the dunes area from the parking lot to as far as the High Dune, which is for pedestrian use only. All national park horse camping areas are in the wilderness in designated backcountry campsites or other wilderness areas at least 0.25?mi (0.4?km) from roads or trails. Camping is permitted anywhere in the national preserve and at designated sites along the Medano Pass Road, as long as minimum impact guidelines are followed. Permitted pack animals in the national park and the preserve include horses, mules, burros, donkeys, alpacas, and llamas. Overnight guests at the Zapata Ranch may take guided trips into the park; Zapata Partners is the only NPS-licensed provider of horseback riding in the Great Sand Dunes.[41][42]\\r\\nUnlike all other national parks in the contiguous United States, Great Sand Dunes National Park is located directly adjacent to a national preserve. The preserve is also managed by the National Park Service and seasonal hunting is permitted there.[16] Sport hunting has regulations which include not pursuing a wounded animal if it leaves the preserve and enters the national park. Mountain lion hunting with dogs is also allowed in the preserve, but unless the dogs have spotted the lion and are pursuing it, they are required to be leashed.[43] Other game species include turkey, bear, bighorn sheep, elk and mule deer.[44]\\r\\nThe dunes and surrounding area were designated a national monument in 1932 after a billsponsored by the P.E.O. Sisterhood and widely supported by local residentswas signed into law by President Herbert Hoover.[11] The original monument boundaries protected an area of 35,528 acres (55.5?sq?mi; 143.8?km2).[6] Similar support in the late 1990s resulted in the monuments redesignation as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in 2000-2004.[11] The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) designated a management category of V (protected landscape) for the Great Sand Dunes, including the national park, the preserve, and the adjacent Baca National Wildlife Refuge.[45]\\r\\nIn 1976, the U.S. Congress designated the Great Sand Dunes Wildernessa wilderness area encompassing 32,643 acres (51?sq?mi; 132?km2) within the monument. This wilderness is the only one in the U.S. that protects a saltbush-greasewood ecosystem and includes the entire dunefield as well as much of the area west of the dunes.[46][47] Congress also designated the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness in 1993, which contains a total of 219,776 acres (343.4?sq?mi; 889.4?km2) of mountainous terrain.[48] Most of the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness is managed by the U.S. Forest Service while the National Park Service manages the area that has since been designated a national preserve.[49] Mechanized transport and motorized equipment or vehicles are not permitted in wilderness areas, while ATVs are not permitted anywhere in the national park and preserve.[48] The restrictions of a wilderness designation protect native wildlife such as the endemic Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle from potential extinction caused by human activities.[50] Both of the wilderness area designations exclude the existing road corridors that pass through them, specifically the paved park road and the unpaved Medano Pass Road.[47]\\r\\nIn 1999, the Nature Conservancy purchased surrounding state-owned land.[51] The land is within the MedanoÿZapata Ranch, located to the west and south.[52] Some of the ranch land is located within the current national park boundary in its southwestern corner,[5] and includes a fenced area that contains a bison herd within 44,000 acres (68.8?sq?mi; 178.1?km2)[51]an area that can only be visited on a guided tour.[53][54] The objective of the Nature Conservancy, as well as the federal and state governments, is to combine conservation and sustainable use of the ecosystem, in a manner similar to the protected area mosaic recommended in the early 1980s for parts of the Yukon in Canada.[52]\\r\\nThe eventual redesignation as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve was authorized on November 22, 2000 when President Bill Clinton signed the Congressionally-approved Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve Act. The act directed the Secretary of the Interior to \\"establish the Great Sand Dunes National Park when sufficient land having sufficient diversity of resources has been acquired to warrant its designation.\\"[55] The new designation as a national park and preserve would not be made official until 2004 after sufficient land had been acquired.[56][57]\\r\\nIn 2002, the Nature Conservancy purchased the Baca Ranchan area of 97,000 acres (151.6?sq?mi; 392.5?km2)for $31.28 million. Financing was provided by the Department of the Interior, the Colorado State Land Board and private donors. The Baca Ranch had property located in the valley and the adjacent mountains, ranging in elevation from 7,500?ft (2,286?m) west of the dunes to the 14,165?ft (4,317?m) summit of Kit Carson Peak. The purchase approximately tripled the size of the monument. The ranch was split into three sections: the Sangre de Cristos section east of Crestone became part of the Rio Grande National Forest; the section west of the dunes was designated the Baca National Wildlife Refuge and managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service; the section east of the dunes was transferred first to the Rio Grande National Forest and later redesignated a national preserve in 2004 managed by the National Park Service. The national preserve remains open to regulated seasonal hunting, as it was when designated national forest land, but is protected from logging and mining activities which are generally permitted in national forests.[58]\\r\\nThe boundaries of the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve were established by an act of Congress on September 24, 2004.[2]\\r\\nIn 2016, the federal government began negotiations toward purchasing 12,518 acres (19.6?sq?mi; 50.7?km2) of the MedanoÿZapata Ranch from the Nature Conservancy. The plan is to complete the park, making it fully accessible to the public, by acquiring the final piece of privately-held land located within the current park boundaries. The land includes the area presently occupied by the bison herd, as well as adjacent meadows and wetland areas. The purchase is expected to be completed by 2018.[57]","field3":"When was the great sand dunes national park established?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"placoid","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Scoliodon is a genus of requiem shark, and part of the family Carcharhinidae.

The name tungsten comes from the former Swedish name for the tungstate mineral scheelite, from tung sten \\"heavy stone\\".[9] Tungsten is a rare metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in chemical compounds. It was identified as a new element in 1781, and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include wolframite and scheelite.\\r\\nThe free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered, melting at 3422?C (6192?F, 3695?K). It also has the second highest boiling point, at 5930?C (10706?F, 6203?K). Its density is 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead.[10] Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle[11][12] and hard material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.[13]\\r\\nTungsten's many alloys have numerous applications, including incandescent light bulb filaments, X-ray tubes (as both the filament and target), electrodes in TIG welding, superalloys, and radiation shielding. Tungsten's hardness and high density give it military applications in penetrating projectiles. Tungsten compounds are also often used as industrial catalysts.\\r\\nTungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules, where it is used in a few species of bacteria and archaea. It is the heaviest element known to be essential to any living organism.[14] Tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is somewhat toxic to animal life.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its raw form, tungsten is a hard steel-grey metal that is often brittle and hard to work. If made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds that of many steels), and becomes malleable enough that it can be worked easily.[13] It is worked by forging, drawing, or extruding. Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering.\\r\\nOf all metals in pure form, tungsten has the highest melting point (3422?C, 6192?F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1650?C, 3000?F), and the highest tensile strength.[17] Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.[18] Alloying small quantities of tungsten with steel greatly increases its toughness.[10]\\r\\nTungsten exists in two major crystalline forms: ϫ and . The former has a body-centered cubic structure and is the more stable form. The structure of the  phase is called A15 cubic; it is metastable, but can coexist with the ϫ phase at ambient conditions owing to non-equilibrium synthesis or stabilization by impurities. Contrary to the ϫ phase which crystallizes in isometric grains, the  form exhibits a columnar habit. The ϫ phase has one third of the electrical resistivity[19] and a much lower superconducting transition temperature TC relative to the  phase: ca. 0.015 K vs. 1ÿ4 K; mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate TC values.[20][21] The TC value can also be raised by alloying tungsten with another metal (e.g. 7.9 K for W-Tc).[22] Such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in low-temperature superconducting circuits.[23][24][25]\\r\\nNaturally occurring tungsten consists of five isotopes whose half-lives are so long that they can be considered stable. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has been observed[26][27] to do so with a half-life of (1.8 I 0.2)G1018 years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural tungsten per year.[28] The other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay, constraining their half-lives to be at least 4G1021 years.\\r\\nAnother 30 artificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been characterized, the most stable of which are 181W with a half-life of 121.2?days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1?days, 188W with a half-life of 69.4?days, 178W with a half-life of 21.6?days, and 187W with a half-life of 23.72 h.[28] All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 3?hours, and most of these have half-lives below 8?minutes.[28] Tungsten also has 4?meta states, the most stable being 179mW (t1/2 6.4?minutes).\\r\\nElemental tungsten resists attack by oxygen, acids, and alkalis.[29]\\r\\nThe most common formal oxidation state of tungsten is +6, but it exhibits all oxidation states from ?2 to +6.[29][30] Tungsten typically combines with oxygen to form the yellow tungstic oxide, WO3, which dissolves in aqueous alkaline solutions to form tungstate ions, WO2?\\r\\n4.\\r\\nTungsten carbides (W2C and WC) are produced by heating powdered tungsten with carbon. W2C is resistant to chemical attack, although it reacts strongly with chlorine to form tungsten hexachloride (WCl6).[10]\\r\\nIn aqueous solution, tungstate gives the heteropoly acids and polyoxometalate anions under neutral and acidic conditions. As tungstate is progressively treated with acid, it first yields the soluble, metastable \\"paratungstate A\\" anion, W\\r\\n7O6ÿ\\r\\n24, which over time converts to the less soluble \\"paratungstate B\\" anion, H\\r\\n2W\\r\\n12O10ÿ\\r\\n42.[31] Further acidification produces the very soluble metatungstate anion, H\\r\\n2W\\r\\n12O6ÿ\\r\\n40, after which equilibrium is reached. The metatungstate ion exists as a symmetric cluster of twelve tungsten-oxygen octahedra known as the Keggin anion. Many other polyoxometalate anions exist as metastable species. The inclusion of a different atom such as phosphorus in place of the two central hydrogens in metatungstate produces a wide variety of heteropoly acids, such as phosphotungstic acid H3PW12O40.\\r\\nTungsten trioxide can form intercalation compounds with alkali metals. These are known as bronzes; an example is sodium tungsten bronze.\\r\\nIn 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time named tungsten).[32] Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested that it might be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid.[33] In 1783, Jos and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society in the town of Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element.[34][35][36]\\r\\nIn World War II, tungsten played a significant role in background political dealings. Portugal, as the main European source of the element, was put under pressure from both sides, because of its deposits of wolframite ore at Panasqueira. Tungsten's desirable properties such as resistance to high temperatures, its hardness and density, and its strengthening of alloys made it an important raw material for the arms industry,[37][38] both as a constituent of weapons and equipment and employed in production itself, e.g., in tungsten carbide cutting tools for machining steel.\\r\\nThe name \\"tungsten\\" (from the Swedish tung sten, \\"heavy stone\\") is used in English, French, and many other languages as the name of the element, but not in the Nordic countries. Tungsten was the old Swedish name for the mineral scheelite. \\"Wolfram\\" (or \\"volfram\\") is used in most European (especially Germanic and Slavic) languages, and is derived from the mineral wolframite, which is the origin of the chemical symbol W.[13] The name \\"wolframite\\" is derived from German \\"wolf rahm\\" (\\"wolf soot\\" or \\"wolf cream\\"), the name given to tungsten by Johan Gottschalk Wallerius in 1747. This, in turn, derives from \\"lupi spuma\\", the name Georg Agricola used for the element in 1546, which translates into English as \\"wolf's froth\\", and is a reference to the large amounts of tin consumed by the mineral during its extraction.[39]\\r\\nTungsten is found mainly in the mineral wolframite (ironÿmanganese tungstate (Fe,Mn)WO4, which is a solid solution of the two minerals ferberite FeWO4, and hbnerite MnWO4) and scheelite (calcium tungstate (CaWO4). Other tungsten minerals range in their level of abundance from moderate to very rare, and have almost no economical value.\\r\\nAbout 61,300 tonnes of tungsten concentrates were produced in the year 2009,[40] and in 2010, world production of tungsten was about 68,000 tonnes.[41] The main producers were as follows (data in tonnes):[42]\\r\\nThere is additional production in the U.S., but the amount is proprietary company information. U.S. reserves are 140,000 tonnes.[42] US industrial use of wolfram is 20,000 tones: 15,000 tones are imported and the remaining 5,000 tones come from domestic recycling.[43]\\r\\nTungsten is considered to be a conflict mineral due to the unethical mining practices observed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[44][45]\\r\\nThere is a large deposit of tungsten ore on the edge of Dartmoor in the United Kingdom, which was exploited during World War I and World War II as the Hemerdon Mine. With recent increases in tungsten prices, as of 2014 this mine has been reactivated.[46]\\r\\nTungsten is extracted from its ores in several stages. The ore is eventually converted to tungsten(VI) oxide (WO3), which is heated with hydrogen or carbon to produce powdered tungsten.[33] Because of tungsten's high melting point, it is not commercially feasible to cast tungsten ingots. Instead, powdered tungsten is mixed with small amounts of powdered nickel or other metals, and sintered. During the sintering process, the nickel diffuses into the tungsten, producing an alloy.\\r\\nTungsten can also be extracted by hydrogen reduction of WF6:\\r\\nor pyrolytic decomposition:[47]\\r\\nTungsten is not traded as a futures contract and cannot be tracked on exchanges like the London Metal Exchange. The prices are usually quoted for tungsten concentrate or WO3. If converted to the metal equivalent, they were about US$19 per kilogram in 2009.[40]\\r\\nApproximately half of the tungsten is consumed for the production of hard materials ÿ namely tungsten carbide ÿ with the remaining major use being in alloys and steels. Less than 10% is used in other chemical compounds.[48]\\r\\nTungsten is mainly used in the production of hard materials based on tungsten carbide, one of the hardest carbides, with a melting point of 2770?C. WC is an efficient electrical conductor, but W2C is less so. WC is used to make wear-resistant abrasives, and \\"carbide\\" cutting tools such as knives, drills, circular saws, milling and turning tools used by the metalworking, woodworking, mining, petroleum and construction industries.[10] Carbide tooling is actually a ceramic/metal composite, where metallic cobalt acts as a binding (matrix) material to hold the WC particles in place. This type of industrial use accounts for about 60% of current tungsten consumption.[49]\\r\\nThe jewelry industry makes rings of sintered tungsten carbide, tungsten carbide/metal composites, and also metallic tungsten.[50] WC/metal composite rings use nickel as the metal matrix in place of cobalt because it takes a higher luster when polished. Sometimes manufacturers or retailers refer to tungsten carbide as a metal, but it is a ceramic.[51] Because of tungsten carbide's hardness, rings made of this material are extremely abrasion resistant, and will hold a burnished finish longer than rings made of metallic tungsten. Tungsten carbide rings are brittle, however, and may crack under a sharp blow.[52]\\r\\nThe hardness and density of tungsten are applied in obtaining heavy metal alloys. A good example is high speed steel, which can contain as much as 18% tungsten.[53] Tungsten's high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like rocket nozzles, for example in the UGM-27 Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile.[54] Tungsten alloys are used in a wide range of different applications, including the aerospace and automotive industries and radiation shielding.[55] Superalloys containing tungsten, such as Hastelloy and Stellite, are used in turbine blades and wear-resistant parts and coatings. Quenched (martensitic) tungsten steel (approx. 5.5% to 7.0% W with 0.5% to 0.7% C) was used for making hard permanent magnets, due to its high remanence and coercivity, as noted by John Hopkinson (1849 - 1898) as early as 1886. The magnetic properties of a metal or an alloy are very sensitive to microstructure. For example, while the element tungsten is not ferromagnetic (but iron, of course, is), when present in steel in these proportions, it stabilizes the martensite phase, which has an enhanced ferromagnetism, as compared to the ferrite (iron) phase, due to its greater resistance to magnetic domain wall motion.\\r\\nTungsten's heat resistance makes it useful in arc welding applications when combined with another highly-conductive metal such as silver or copper. The silver or copper provides the necessary conductivity and the tungsten allows the welding rod to withstand the high-temperatures of the arc welding environment.\\r\\nTungsten, usually alloyed with nickel and iron or cobalt to form heavy alloys, is used in kinetic energy penetrators as an alternative to depleted uranium, in applications where uranium's radioactivity is problematic even in depleted form, or where uranium's additional pyrophoric properties are not required (for example, in ordinary small arms bullets designed to penetrate body armor). Similarly, tungsten alloys have also been used in cannon shells, grenades and missiles, to create supersonic shrapnel. Germany used tungsten during World War II to produce shells for anti-tank gun designs using the Gerlich \\"squeeze\\" principle to achieve very high muzzle velocity and enhanced armor penetration from comparatively small caliber and light weight field artillery. The weapons were highly effective but a shortage of tungsten used in the shell core limited that effectiveness.\\r\\nTungsten has also been used in Dense Inert Metal Explosives, which use it as dense powder to reduce collateral damage while increasing the lethality of explosives within a small radius.[56]\\r\\nTungsten(IV) sulfide is a high temperature lubricant and is a component of catalysts for hydrodesulfurization.[57] MoS2 is more commonly used for such applications.[58]\\r\\nTungsten oxides are used in ceramic glazes and calcium/magnesium tungstates are used widely in fluorescent lighting. Crystal tungstates are used as scintillation detectors in nuclear physics and nuclear medicine. Other salts that contain tungsten are used in the chemical and tanning industries.[17]\\r\\nTungsten oxide (WO3) is incorporated into selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts found in coal-fired power plants. These catalysts convert nitrogen oxides (NOx) to nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O) using ammonia (NH3). The tungsten oxide helps with the physical strength of the catalyst and extends catalyst life.[59]\\r\\nApplications requiring its high density include weights, counterweights, ballast keels for yachts, tail ballast for commercial aircraft, and as ballast in race cars for NASCAR and Formula One; depleted uranium is also used for these purposes, due to similarly high density. Seventy-five-kg blocks of tungsten were used as \\"cruise balance mass devices\\" on the entry vehicle portion of the 2012 Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. It is an ideal material to use as a dolly for riveting, where the mass necessary for good results can be achieved in a compact bar. High-density alloys of tungsten with nickel, copper or iron are used in high-quality darts[60] (to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings) or for fishing lures (tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly). Some cello C strings are wound with tungsten. The extra density gives this string more projection and often cellists will buy just this string and use it with three strings from a different set.[61][unreliable source?] Tungsten is used as an absorber on the electron telescope on the Cosmic Ray System of the two Voyager spacecraft.[62]\\r\\nSodium tungstate is used in Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent, a mixture of different chemicals used in the \\"Lowry Assay\\" for protein content analysis.\\r\\nIts density, similar to that of gold, allows tungsten to be used in jewelry as an alternative to gold or platinum.[13][63] Metallic tungsten is hypoallergenic, and is harder than gold alloys (though not as hard as tungsten carbide), making it useful for rings that will resist scratching, especially in designs with a brushed finish.\\r\\nBecause the density is so similar to that of gold (tungsten is only 0.36% less dense), tungsten can also be used in counterfeiting of gold bars, such as by plating a tungsten bar with gold,[64][65][66] which has been observed since the 1980s,[67] or taking an existing gold bar, drilling holes, and replacing the removed gold with tungsten rods.[68] The densities are not exactly the same, and other properties of gold and tungsten differ, but gold-plated tungsten will pass superficial tests.[64]\\r\\nGold-plated tungsten is available commercially from China (the main source of tungsten), both in jewelry and as bars.[69]\\r\\nBecause it retains its strength at high temperatures and has a high melting point, elemental tungsten is used in many high-temperature applications,[70] such as light bulb, cathode-ray tube, and vacuum tube filaments, heating elements, and rocket engine nozzles.[13] Its high melting point also makes tungsten suitable for aerospace and high-temperature uses such as electrical, heating, and welding applications, notably in the gas tungsten arc welding process (also called tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding).\\r\\nBecause of its conductive properties and relative chemical inertness, tungsten is also used in electrodes, and in the emitter tips in electron-beam instruments that use field emission guns, such as electron microscopes. In electronics, tungsten is used as an interconnect material in integrated circuits, between the silicon dioxide dielectric material and the transistors. It is used in metallic films, which replace the wiring used in conventional electronics with a coat of tungsten (or molybdenum) on silicon.[47]\\r\\nThe electronic structure of tungsten makes it one of the main sources for X-ray targets,[71][72] and also for shielding from high-energy radiations (such as in the radiopharmaceutical industry for shielding radioactive samples of FDG). It is also used in gamma imaging as a material from which coded apertures are made, due to its excellent shielding properties. Tungsten powder is used as a filler material in plastic composites, which are used as a nontoxic substitute for lead in bullets, shot, and radiation shields. Since this element's thermal expansion is similar to borosilicate glass, it is used for making glass-to-metal seals.[17] In addition to its high melting point, when tungsten is doped with potassium, it leads to an increased shape stability (compared to non-doped tungsten). This ensures that the filament does not sag, and no undesired changes occur.[73]\\r\\nThrough top-down nanofabrication processes, tungsten nanowires have been fabricated and studied since 2002.[74] Due to a particularly high surface to volume ratio, the formation of a surface oxide layer and the single crystal nature of such material, the mechanical properties differ fundamentally from those of bulk tungsten.[75] Such tungsten nanowires have potential applications in nanoelectronics and importantly as pH probes and gas sensors.[76] In similarity to silicon nanowires, tungsten nanowires are frequently produced from a bulk tungsten precursor followed by a thermal oxidation step to control morphology in terms of length and aspect ratio.[77] Using the DealÿGrove model it is possible to predict the oxidation kinetics of nanowires fabricated through such thermal oxidation processing.[78]\\r\\nTungsten, at atomic number 74, is the heaviest element known to be biologically functional, with the next heaviest being iodine (Z = 53). It is used by some bacteria and archaea[79], but not in eukaryotes. For example, enzymes called oxidoreductases use tungsten similarly to molybdenum by using it in a tungsten-pterin complex with molybdopterin (molybdopterin, despite its name, does not contain molybdenum, but may complex with either molybdenum or tungsten in use by living organisms). Tungsten-using enzymes typically reduce carboxylic acids to aldehydes.[80] The tungsten oxidoreductases may also catalyse oxidations. The first tungsten-requiring enzyme to be discovered also requires selenium, and in this case the tungsten-selenium pair may function analogously to the molybdenum-sulfur pairing of some molybdenum cofactor-requiring enzymes.[81] One of the enzymes in the oxidoreductase family which sometimes employ tungsten (bacterial formate dehydrogenase H) is known to use a selenium-molybdenum version of molybdopterin.[82] Acetylene hydratase is an unusual metalloenzyme in that it catalyzes a hydration reaction. Two reaction mechanisms have been proposed, in one of which there is a direct interaction between the tungsten atom and the CC triple bond.[83] Although a tungsten-containing xanthine dehydrogenase from bacteria has been found to contain tungsten-molydopterin and also non-protein bound selenium, a tungsten-selenium molybdopterin complex has not been definitively described.[84]\\r\\nIn soil, tungsten metal oxidizes to the tungstate anion. It can be selectively or non-selectively imported by some prokaryotic organisms and may substitute for molybdate in certain enzymes. Its effect on the action of these enzymes is in some cases inhibitory and in others positive.[85] The soil's chemistry determines how the tungsten polymerizes; alkaline soils cause monomeric tungstates; acidic soils cause polymeric tungstates.[86]\\r\\nSodium tungstate and lead have been studied for their effect on earthworms. Lead was found to be lethal at low levels and sodium tungstate was much less toxic, but the tungstate completely inhibited their reproductive ability.[87]\\r\\nTungsten has been studied as a biological copper metabolic antagonist, in a role similar to the action of molybdenum. It has been found that tetrathiotungstates may be used as biological copper chelation chemicals, similar to the tetrathiomolybdates.[88]\\r\\nTungsten is essential for some archaea. The following tungsten-utilizing enzymes are known:\\r\\nA wtp system is known to selectively transport tungsten in archaea:\\r\\nBecause tungsten is rare[clarification needed] and its compounds are generally inert, the effects of tungsten on the environment are limited.[90] It was first believed to be relatively inert and an only slightly toxic metal, beginning in the year 2000, the risk exerted by tungsten alloys, its dusts and particulates to induce cancer and several other adverse effects in animals as well as humans has been highlighted from in vitro and in vivo experiments. [91][92] The median lethal dose LD50 depends strongly on the animal and the method of administration and varies between 59?mg/kg (intravenous, rabbits)[93][94] and 5000?mg/kg (tungsten metal powder, intraperitoneal, rats).[95][96]\\r\\nPeople can be exposed to tungsten in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5?mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10?mg/m3.[97]\\r\\nTungsten is unique amongst the elements in that it has been the subject of patent proceedings. In 1928, a US court rejected General Electric's attempt to patent it, overturning U.S. Patent 1,082,933 granted in 1913 to William D. Coolidge.[98][99]","field3":"Is tungsten a metal or nonmetal or metalloid?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"fifth-century","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"","field3":"When did the anglo saxons arrive in britain?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Don Henley","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"\\"Hotel California\\" is the title track from the Eagles' album of the same name and was released as a single in February 1977.[2] Writing credits for the song are shared by Don Felder (music), Don Henley, and Glenn Frey (lyrics). The Eagles' original recording of the song features Henley singing the lead vocals and concludes with an extended section of electric guitar interplay between Felder and Joe Walsh.\\r\\nThe song is considered the most famous recording by the band, and its long guitar coda has been voted the best guitar solo of all time by readers of Guitarist in 1998.[3][4] The song was awarded the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1978.[5] The lyrics of the song have been given various interpretations by fans and critics alike, the Eagles themselves described the song as their \\"interpretation of the high life in Los Angeles\\".[6] In the 2013 documentary History of the Eagles, Henley said that the song was about \\"a journey from innocence to experience... that's all...\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe melody of the song was composed by Don Felder in a rented house on Malibu Beach. He recorded the basic tracks with a Rhythm Ace drum machine and added a 12 string guitar on a four-track recording deck in his spare bedroom, then mixed in a bassline, and gave Don Henley and Glenn Frey each the resulting demo cassette.[8] Felder, who met the Eagles through his high school bandmate Bernie Leadon, said that Leadon advised him to make tapes of songs he wrote for the band so that other band members like Henley, whose forte is in writing lyrics, might work with him on finishing the songs they like.[9] The demos he made were always instrumental, and on every album project he would submit 15 or 16 ideas. The demo he made for Hotel California showed influences from Latin and reggae music, and it grabbed the attention of Henley who said he liked the song that \\"sounds like a Mexican reggae or Bolero\\",[9] which gave the song its first working title, \\"Mexican Reggae\\".[10]\\r\\nFrey and Henley were both interested in the tune after hearing the demo, and discussed the concept for the lyrics. In 2008, Felder described the writing of the lyrics:\\r\\nDon Henley and Glenn wrote most of the words. All of us kind of drove into L.A. at night. Nobody was from California, and if you drive into L.A. at night... you can just see this glow on the horizon of lights, and the images that start running through your head of Hollywood and all the dreams that you have, and so it was kind of about that... what we started writing the song about.[11]\\r\\nHenley decided on the theme of Hotel California, noting how The Beverly Hills Hotel had become a literal and symbolic focal point of their lives at that time.[12] Henley said of their personal and professional experience in LA: \\"We were getting an extensive education, in life, in love, in business. Beverly Hills was still a mythical place to us. In that sense it became something of a symbol, and the 'Hotel' the locus of all that LA had come to mean for us. In a sentence, I'd sum it up as the end of the innocence, round one.\\"[13]\\r\\nFrey came up with a cinematic scenario of a person who, tired from driving a long distance in a desert, saw a place for a rest and pulled in for the night, but entered \\"a weird world peopled by freaky characters\\", and became \\"quickly spooked by the claustrophobic feeling of being caught in a disturbing web from which he may never escape.\\"[8] In an interview with Cameron Crowe, Frey said that he and Henley wanted the song \\"to open like an episode of the Twilight Zone\\", and added: \\"We take this guy and make him like a character in The Magus, where every time he walks through a door theres a new version of reality. We wanted to write a song just like it was a movie.\\"[12] Frey described the song in an interview with NBC's Bob Costas as a cinematic montage \\"just one shot to the next ... a picture of a guy on the highway, a picture of the hotel, the guy walks in, the door opens, strange people.\\" Frey continued: \\"We decided to create something strange, just to see if we could do it.\\"[3][14] Henley then wrote most of the lyrics based on Frey's idea, and sought inspiration for the writing by driving out into the desert as well as from films and theater.[12]\\r\\nPart of the lyrics, such as \\"Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes bends / She got a lot of pretty pretty boys she calls friends\\", are based on Henley's break-up with his girlfriend Loree Rodkin.[8][13] According to Glenn Frey's liner notes for The Very Best Of, the use of the word \\"steely\\" in the lyric, \\"They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast,\\" was a playful nod to the band Steely Dan, who had included the lyric \\"Turn up the Eagles, the neighbors are listening\\" in their song \\"Everything You Did\\".[15] Frey had also said that the writing of the song was inspired by the boldness of Steely Dan's lyrics and its willingness to go \\"out there\\",[12] and thought that the song they wrote had \\"achieved perfect ambiguity.\\"[14]\\r\\nThe Eagles recorded the track with Don Henley on lead vocal three different times, twice at the Record Plant in Los Angeles and finally at the Criteria Studios in Miami.[3][16] They first recorded a riff, but when it came to recording the vocal, it was found to be in too high a key for Henley's voice, so Felder progressively lowered the key from E minor, eventually settling on B minor. The second recording however was judged too fast.[3] In Miami, the band fine-tuned the instrumentation and the lyrics and recorded numerous takes. Five or six best ones were selected, and the best parts were then spliced together to create the released version. According to the producer Bill Szymczyk, there were 33 edits on the two?inch master.[16] The final section features a guitar battle between Joe Walsh (who had replaced Bernie Leadon who left in 1975) and Felder, which took the two of them sitting together working for around three days to achieve the necessary precision.[8] Walsh and Felder initially started improvising but Henley insisted that the recording should follow the music as first recorded in Felder's demo.[9]\\r\\nHenley decided that the song should be a single, although Felder had doubts and the record company was reluctant to release it as a single because, at over six minutes, its duration far exceeds that of the songs generally played by radio stations.[9][17] The band took a stand and refused the label's request to shorten the song.[18] The song was released as the second single from the album after \\"New Kid in Town\\". The front cover art for some overseas editions of the 45rpm single released was a reworked version of the Hotel California LP cover art, which used a photograph of the Beverly Hills Hotel by David Alexander, with design and art direction by Kosh.[19]\\r\\nAs \\"Hotel California\\" became one of the group's most popular songs and a concert staple for the band,[20] live recordings of the song have therefore also been released. The first live recording of the song appeared on the Eagles' 1980 live album, and an acoustic version with an extended intro is a track in the 1994 Hell Freezes Over reunion concert CD and video release.[21] The Hell Freezes Over version is performed using eight guitars and has a decidedly Spanish sound, with Don Felder's flamenco-inspired arrangement and intro.[22]\\r\\n\\"Hotel California\\" first entered the Billboard Hot 100 on chart dated February 26, 1977,[23] and topped the Hot 100 singles chart for one week in May 1977,[24] the band's fourth song to reach No. 1 on that chart.[5] It peaked at number 10 on the Easy Listening chart in April 1977.[25] Billboard ranked it number 19 on its 1977 Pop Singles year-end chart.[26] Three months after its first release, the single was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), representing one million copies shipped. In 2009, the song was further certified Platinum (Digital Sales Award) by the RIAA for sales of one million digital downloads,[27] and has since sold over 3 million downloads.[28]\\r\\nThe Eagles won the 1977 Grammy Award for Record of the Year for \\"Hotel California\\" at the 20th Grammy Awards in 1978.[29]\\r\\nThe song is rated highly in many rock music lists and polls; Rolling Stone magazine ranked it number 49 on its list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\".[30] It was named one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.[31] At the induction of the Eagles into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, all seven former and present members of the band reunited to perform \\"Hotel California\\".[32]\\r\\nThe song's guitar solo was voted the best solo of all time by readers of Guitarist magazine in 1998,[4] and was ranked 8th on Guitar Magazine's Top 100 Guitar Solos.[33] The song was also included in the music video game Guitar Hero World Tour. It was ranked the number 1 in the list of the best 12-string guitar songs of all times by Guitar World magazine in 2015.[34]\\r\\nDon Henley has given a number of explanations about the song, ranging from \\"a journey from innocence to experience\\"[7] to \\"a sociopolitical statement\\".[35] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Henley said that the song was meant to be \\"more of a symbolic piece about America in general\\", and added: \\"Lyrically, the song deals with traditional or classical themes of conflict: darkness and light, good and evil, youth and age, the spiritual versus the secular. I guess you could say it's a song about loss of innocence.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe song has been described as being \\"all about American decadence and burnout, too much money, corruption, drugs and arrogance; too little humility and heart.\\"[8] It has also been interpreted an allegory about hedonism, self-destruction, and greed in the music industry of the late 1970s.[36] Don Henley called it \\"our interpretation of the high life in Los Angeles\\",[37] and later said: \\"It's basically a song about the dark underbelly of the American dream and about excess in America, which is something we knew a lot about.\\"[38] In the 2013 documentary, History of the Eagles, Henley reiterated:\\r\\nOn just about every album we made, there was some kind of commentary on the music business, and on American culture in general. The hotel itself could be taken as a metaphor not only for the myth-making of Southern California, but for the myth-making that is the American Dream, because it is a fine line between the American Dream, and the American nightmare.[39]\\r\\nIn a 2009 interview, The Plain Dealer music critic John Soeder asked Don Henley if he regretted writing the lines \\"So I called up the captain / 'Please bring me my wine' / He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here since 1969'\\" because wines are fermented while spirits are distilled. Henley responded:\\r\\nThanks for the tutorial and, no, you're not the first to bring this to my attention  and you're not the first to completely misinterpret the lyric and miss the metaphor. Believe me, I've consumed enough alcoholic beverages in my time to know how they are made and what the proper nomenclature is. But that line in the song has little or nothing to do with alcoholic beverages. It's a sociopolitical statement. My only regret would be having to explain it in detail to you, which would defeat the purpose of using literary devices in songwriting and lower the discussion to some silly and irrelevant argument about chemical processes.[35]\\r\\nIn his Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings, Volume 1, Steve Sullivan theorizes that the \\"spirit\\" that the Hotel California hasn't had since 1969 refers to the spirit of social activism of the 1960s, and how disco and the related pop music of mid-1970s had turned away from it.[8]\\r\\nThe metaphorical character of the story related in the lyrics has inspired a number of conjectural interpretations by listeners. In the 1980s some Christian evangelists alleged that \\"Hotel California\\" referred to a San Francisco hotel that was purchased by Anton LaVey and converted into his Church of Satan.[40][41] Other rumors suggested that the Hotel California was the Camarillo State Mental Hospital.[42]\\r\\nThe term \\"colitas\\" in the first stanza (\\"warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air\\") has been interpreted as a sexual slang or a reference to marijuana.[43] \\"Colitas\\" means \\"little tails\\" in Spanish; in Mexican slang it refers to buds of the cannabis (marijuana) plant.[44][45] According to Glenn Frey, the \\"warm smell\\" is \\"colitas...it means little tails, the very top of the plant.\\"[46] The Eagles' manager Irving Azoff appears to lend support to the marijuana hypothesis,[47] however, Felder said: \\"The colitas is a plant that grows in the desert that blooms at night, and it has this kind of pungent, almost funky smell. Don Henley came up with a lot of the lyrics for that song, and he came up with colitas.\\"[43]\\r\\nOther interpretations of the songs include heroin addiction and cannibalism.[3] On the various interpretations, Henley said: \\"Some of the wilder interpretations of that song have been amazing. It was really about the excesses of American culture and certain girls we knew. But it was also about the uneasy balance between art and commerce.\\"[43]\\r\\nThe intro and verse's chord pattern counts eight measures, each one assigned to a single chord. Seven different chords are used in the eight measures. As the song opens, it is not until the eighth measure that a chord is repeated. The song is initially in the key of B-minor.[48] The presence of E major gives a hint of B Dorian.\\r\\nThe chords are played as follows:\\r\\nThe eight measure sequence is repeated in the intro, for each verse and in the outro, providing the harmonic framework for the entire extended dual guitar solo at the end of the song.[48] One explanation of the progression is that it is a common flamenco chord progression called the \\"Spanish progression\\" (iÿVIIÿVIÿV in a phrygian context) that is interspersed with consecutive fifths.[48] With its descending ostinato pattern, it could be considered a fandango, a forerunner of the Baroque chaconne form.[49]\\r\\nThis chord sequence is not commonly used, and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull has pointed out its similarity to his song \\"We Used to Know\\" from their 1969 album Stand Up, suggesting the Eagles heard it when they toured together.[50] While the Eagles did open for Jethro Tull in June 1972, Don Felder, who wrote the music, did not join the band until 1974 and would not have been in the audience or backstage.[51] Felder has said that he had never heard \\"We Used to Know\\", and that he was unfamiliar with Jethro Tull apart from the fact the frontman plays a flute.[52]\\r\\nThe chorus, or refrain, uses five of the song's seven chords, structured with the melody in a way that shifts the key from B-minor to its relative major of D:[48]\\r\\nAl B.

(1990).[53] Gipsy Kings recorded a flamenco version sung in Spanish,[54] which was used in the soundtrack for the film The Big Lebowski.[55] The Orb, under the name of Jam On The Mutha produced a version which charted at No. 62 on the UK chart in 1990.[56][57] Mike Piranha recorded \\"Hotel Honolulu\\" in 1998, satirizing overdevelopment, crime, and other issues on Oahu, which became a local hit in Hawaii.[58] The Romanian band Vama Veche recorded its version with different lyrics entitled \\"Hotel Ci?migiu\\", sung in its native language.[59] Alabama 3 covered the song for the album, La Peste (2000).[60] Nancy Sinatra recorded a cover version for her 2002 album California Girl, an album of songs about California.[61] The Cat Empire recorded a version sung in French \\"L'hotel de Californie\\" for Triple J's Like a Version segment, and is included in its 2005 compilation album as well as the band's 2003 live album On the Attack.[62] The Killers and Rhythms del Mundo collaborated their version with Afro-Cuban music for the 2009 Artists' Project Earth charity, and it appeared on the album Rhythms del Mundo Classics.[63]\\r\\nFrank Ocean released a version sampling the entire instrumental track of \\"Hotel California\\" with his own vocal and lyrics on his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra (2011), entitled \\"American Wedding\\".[64] However, it led to a threatened lawsuit from Don Henley for copyright infringement.[65]\\r\\n\\"Hotel California\\" and its lyrics have become absorbed into the wider culture around the world, and have been used by various writers and commentators to reflect on issues ranging from politics to social media and welfare,[66][67][68] or as an observation on a particular situation.[69][70] The lines \\"We are programmed to receive / You can check out any time you like / But you can never leave!\\" were used by an economist to refer to how the appeal of an attractive \\"Hotel California\\"-type host country to foreign investors may be countered by the cost of exit on leaving the country.[71] A term \\"The Hotel California Effect\\" was then used to refer to the negative effect of financial regulations on investment,[72] and the problems foreigner investors faced when getting their money out of China.[73][74] It has also applied to other ideas such as leaving a service provider or social media network.[75][76] A book titled Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War Inside Iraq was written about the clandestine operation named after the song title by CIAÿUS Special Forces teams in Iraqi Kurdistan in the lead-up to the Iraq War.[77][78]\\r\\nAlthough the Eagles were noted for their reluctance to license their songs for use in shows,[79] the song had been used in a number of films and television shows, such as The Big Lebowski (performed by Gipsy Kings),[55] Absolutely Fabulous, and The Sopranos.[43] Most recently it was used during the final scenes of the premiere episode of American Horror Story: Hotel in October 2015.[80]\\r\\nAccording to Rolling Stone, Julia Phillips, the producer of films like Taxi Driver and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was interested in shooting a movie based on the song's story. Although the band members and Phillips met to discuss the project, tension between the two parties ended the pre-development deal for the film.[81]\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\nsales+streaming figures based on certification alone","field3":"Who was the lead singer in hotel california?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The Norwegian Nobel Committee each year awards the Nobel Peace Prize (Norwegian and Swedish: Nobels fredspris) \\"to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\\"[1] It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[2] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Norwegian Nobel Committee and awarded by a committee of five people elected by the Parliament of Norway.[3] The first Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 1901 to Frdric Passy and Henry Dunant; the prize was most recently awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons in 2017. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma, and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4] In 1901, Passy and Dunant shared a Prize of 150,782 Swedish kronor, which was equal to 7,731,004 kronor in 2008. The Peace Prize is presented annually in Oslo, in the presence of the King of Norway, on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death, and is the only Nobel Prize not presented in Stockholm.[5] Unlike the other prizes, the Peace Prize is occasionally awarded to an organisation (such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, a three-time recipient) rather than an individual.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prize is considered the most controversial of the Nobel Prizes with several of the selections having been criticised.[6][7] Despite having been nominated five times, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never won the Prize. Following his assassination in 1948, the committee considered awarding it to him posthumously but decided against it and instead withheld the Prize that year with the explanation that \\"there was no suitable living candidate.\\"[8] In 1961, Dag Hammarskj?ld, who died after his nomination but several months before the announcement, became the only laureate to be recognised posthumously; following this, the statutes were changed to make a future posthumous prize nearly impossible.[9] In 1973, Le Duc Tho declined the Prize, because \\"he was not in a position to accept the Prize, citing the situation in Vietnam as his reason.\\"[10] Linus Pauling, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate in 1962, is the only person to have been awarded two unshared Nobel Prizes; he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954.[10]  At 17 years of age, Malala Yousafzai, the 2014 recipient, is the youngest to be awarded the Peace Prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2016[update], the Peace Prize has been awarded to 104 individuals and 23 organizations.

As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 66,135. The name \\"Schenectady\\" is derived from a Mohawk word skahnhtati meaning \\"beyond the pines\\". The city was founded on the south side of the Mohawk River by Dutch colonists in the 17th century, many from the Albany area. They were prohibited from the fur trade by the Albany monopoly, which kept its control after the English takeover in 1664. Residents of the new village developed farms on strip plots along the river.\\r\\nConnected to the west via the Mohawk River and Erie Canal, the city developed rapidly in the 19th century as part of the Mohawk Valley trade, manufacturing and transportation corridor. By 1824 more people worked in manufacturing than agriculture or trade, and the city had a cotton mill, processing cotton from the Deep South. Numerous mills in New York had such ties with the South. Through the 19th century, nationally influential companies and industries developed in Schenectady, including General Electric and American Locomotive Company (ALCO), which were powers into the mid-20th century. The city was part of emerging technologies, with GE collaborating in the production of nuclear-powered submarines and, in the 21st century, working on other forms of renewable energy.\\r\\nThe city is in eastern New York, near the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers. It is in the same metropolitan area as the state capital, Albany, which is about 15 miles (24?km) southeast.[3] In December 2014, the state announced that the city was one of three sites selected for development of off-reservation casino gambling, under terms of a 2013 state constitutional amendment. The project would redevelop an ALCO brownfield site in the city along the waterfront, with hotels, housing and a marina in addition to the casino.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first encountered by Europeans, the Mohawk Valley was the territory of the Mohawk nation, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, or Haudenosaunee. They had occupied territory in the region since at least 1100 AD. Starting in the early 1600s the Mohawk moved their settlements closer to the river and by 1629, they had also taken over territories on the west bank of the Hudson River that were formerly held by the Algonquian-speaking Mahican people.[5]\\r\\nIn the 1640s, the Mohawk had three major villages, all on the south side of the Mohawk River. The easternmost one was Ossernenon, located about 9 miles west of present-day Auriesville, New York. When Dutch settlers developed Fort Orange (present-day Albany, New York) in the Hudson Valley beginning in 1614, the Mohawk called their settlement skahnhtati, meaning \\"beyond the pines,\\" referring to a large area of pine barrens that lay between the Mohawk settlements and the Hudson River. About 3200 acres of this unique ecosystem are now protected as the Albany Pine Bush.[6] Eventually, this word entered the lexicon of the Dutch settlers. The settlers in Fort Orange used skahnhtati to refer to the new village at the Mohawk flats (see below), which became known as Schenectady (with a variety of spellings).[7][8]\\r\\nIn 1661 Arent van Curler, a Dutch immigrant bought a big piece of land on the south side of the Mohawk River. Other colonists were given grants of land by the colonial government in this portion of the flat fertile river valley, as part of New Netherland. The settlers recognized that these bottomlands had been cultivated for maize by the Mohawk for centuries.[9] Van Curler took the largest piece of land; the remainder was divided into 50-acre plots for the other first fourteen proprietors. As most early colonists were from the Fort Orange area, they may have anticipated working as fur traders, but the Beverwijck (later Albany) traders kept a monopoly of legal control. The settlers here turned to farming. Their 50-acre lots were unique for the colony, \\"laid out in strips along the Mohawk River\\", with the narrow edges fronting the river, as in French colonial style.[10] They relied on rearing livestock and wheat.[10] The proprietors and their descendants controlled all the land of the town for generations,[9][10] essentially acting as government until after the Revolutionary War, when representative government was established.\\r\\nFrom the early days of interaction, early Dutch traders in the valley had unions with Mohawk women, if not always official marriages. Their children were raised within the Mohawk community, which had a matrilineal kinship system, considering children born into the mother's clan. Even within Mohawk society, biological fathers played minor roles.\\r\\nSome mixed-race descendants, such as Jacques Cornelissen Van Slyck and his sister Hilletie van Olinda, who were of Dutch, French and Mohawk ancestry, became interpreters and intermarried with Dutch colonists. They also gained land in the Schenectady settlement.[11] They were among the few mtis who seemed to move from Mohawk to Dutch society, as they were described as \\"former Indians\\", although they did not always have an easy time of it.[12] In 1661 Jacques inherited what became known as Van Slyck's Island from his brother Marten, who had been given it by the Mohawk. Van Slyck family descendants retained ownership through the 19th century.[13]\\r\\nBecause of labor shortages in the colony, some Dutch settlers brought African slaves to the region. In Schenectady, they used them as farm laborers. The English also imported slaves and continued with agriculture in the river valley. Traders in Albany kept control of the fur trade after the takeover by the English.\\r\\nIn 1664 the English seized the Dutch New Netherland colony and renamed it New York. They confirmed the monopoly on the fur trade by Albany, and issued orders to prohibit Schenectady from the trade through 1670 and later.[14] Settlers purchased additional land from the Mohawk in 1670 and 1672. (Jacques and Hilletie Van Slyck each received portions of land in the Mohawk 1672 deed for Schenectady.)[15] Twenty years later (1684) Governor Thomas Dongan granted letters patent for Schenectady to five additional trustees.[16]\\r\\nOn February 8, 1690, during King William's War, French forces and their Indian allies, mostly Ojibwe and Algonquin warriors, attacked Schenectady by surprise, leaving 62 dead, 11 of them African slaves.[17] American history notes it as the Schenectady massacre. A total of 27 persons were taken captive, including five African slaves; the raiders took their captives overland about 200 miles to Montreal and its associated Mohawk mission village of Kahnawake.[17] Typically the younger captives were adopted by Mohawk families to replace people who had died.[18] Through the early 18th century in the raiding between Quebec and the northern British colonies, some captives were ransomed by their communities. Colonial governments got involved only for high-ranking officers or other officials.[18] In 1748, during King George's War, the French and Indians attacked Schenectady again, killing 70 residents.\\r\\nIn 1765, Schenectady was incorporated as a borough. During the American Revolutionary War the local militia unit, the 2nd Albany County Militia Regiment, fought in the Battle of Saratoga and against Loyalist troops. Most of the warfare in the Mohawk Valley occurred farther west on the frontier in the areas of German Palatine settlement west of Little Falls. Because of their close business and other relationships with the British, some settlers from the city were Loyalists and moved to Canada in the late stages of the Revolution. The Crown granted them land in what became known as Upper Canada and later Ontario.\\r\\nIt was not until after the Revolutionary War that the village residents were successful in reducing the power of descendants of the early trustees and gained representative government. The settlement was chartered as a city in 1798. Long interested in supporting higher education and morals, the members of the City's three oldest churchesthe Dutch First Reformed Church, St. Georges Episcopal Church, and First Presbyterian Churchformed a \\"union\\" and founded Union College in 1795 under a charter from the state. The school had started in 1785 as Schenectady Academy. This founding was part of the expansion of higher education in upstate New York in the postwar years.\\r\\nDuring this period, migrants poured into upstate and western New York from New England, but there were also new immigrants from England and Europe. Many traveled west along the Mohawk River, settling in the western part of the state, where they developed more agriculture on former Iroquois lands. A dairy industry developed in the central part of the state. New settlers were predominantly of English and Scotch-Irish descent. In 1819, Schenectady suffered a fire that destroyed more than 170 buildings and most of its historic, distinctive Dutch-style architecture.[19]\\r\\nNew York had passed a law for gradual abolition of slavery in 1799,[20] but in 1824, there were still a total of 102 slaves in Schenectady County, with nearly half residing in the city. That year the city of Schenectady had a total population of 3939, which included 240 free blacks, 47 slaves, and 91 foreigners.[21] They finally gained freedom in 1827.\\r\\nIn the 19th century, after completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, Schenectady became an important transportation, manufacturing and trade center. By 1824 more of its population worked in manufacturing than agriculture or trade.[21] Among the industries was a cotton mill,[21] which processed cotton from the Deep South. It was one of many such mills in upstate whose products were part of the exports shipped out of New York City. The city and state had many economic ties to the South at the same time that some residents became active in the abolitionist movement.\\r\\nSchenectady benefited by increased traffic connecting the Hudson River to the Mohawk Valley and the Great Lakes to the west and New York City to the south. The Albany and Schenectady Turnpike (now State Street) was constructed in 1797 to connect Albany to settlements in the Mohawk Valley. The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad started operations in 1831 as one of the first railway lines in the United States, connecting the city and Albany by a route through the pine barrens between them. Developers in Schenectady quickly founded the Utica & Schenectady Railroad, chartered in 1833; Schenectady & Susquehanna Railroad, chartered May 5, 1836; and Schenectady & Troy Railroad, chartered in 1836, making Schenectady \\"the rail hub of America at the time\\" and competing with the Erie Canal.[22] Commodities from the Great Lakes areas and commercial products were shipped to the East and New York City through the Mohawk Valley and Schenectady.\\r\\nThe last slaves in New York and this city gained freedom in 1827, under the state's gradual abolition law. The law first gave freedom to children born to slave mothers, but they were indentured to the mother's master for a period into their early 20s. Union College established a school for black children in 1805, but discontinued it after two years. Methodists helped educate the children for a time, but public schools did not accept them.[23]\\r\\nIn the 1830s, the abolitionist movement grew in Schenectady. In 1836, Rev. Isaac Groot Duryee (also recorded as Duryea) was a co-founder of the interracial Anti-Slavery Society at Union College and in 1837 of the Anti-Slavery Society of Schenectady. Freedom seekers were supported via the Underground Railroad route that ran through the area, passing to the west and north to Canada, which had abolished slavery.[24]\\r\\nIn 1837 Duryee, together with other free people of color, co-founded the First Free Church of Schenectady (now the Duryee Memorial AME Zion Church). He also started a school for students of color. The abolitionist Theodore S. Wright, an African-American minister based in New York City, spoke at the dedication of the church and praised the school.[23][25]\\r\\nThrough the late 19th century, new industries were established in the Mohawk Valley, and powered by the river. Industrial jobs attracted many new immigrants, first from Ireland, and later in the century from Italy and Poland. In 1887, Thomas Edison moved his Edison Machine Works to Schenectady. In 1892, Schenectady became the headquarters of the General Electric Company. This business became a major industrial and economic force and helped establish the city and region as a national manufacturing center. GE became important nationally as a creative company, expanding into many different fields. American Locomotive Company also developed here, from a Schenectady company, and merging several smaller companies in 1901; it was second in the United States in the manufacture of steam locomotives before developing diesel technology.\\r\\nLike other industrial cities in the Mohawk Valley, in the early 20th century, Schenectady attracted many new immigrants from eastern and southern Europe, as they could fill many of the new industrial jobs. It also attracted African Americans as part of the Great Migration out of the rural South to northern cities for work.[26] General Electric and American Locomotive Company (ALCO) were industrial powerhouses, influencing innovation in a variety of fields across the country.\\r\\nSchenectady is home to WGY-AM, the second commercial radio station in the United States, (after WBZ in Springfield, Massachusetts, which was named for Westinghouse.) WGY-AM was named for its owner, General Electric (the G), and the city of Schenectady (the Y).[27] In 1928, General Electric produced the first regular television broadcasts in the United States, when the experimental station W2XB began regular broadcasts on Thursday and Friday afternoons. This television station is now WRGB; for years it was the Capital District's NBC affiliate, but is now the CBS affiliate.\\r\\nThe city reached its peak of population in 1930. The Great Depression caused a loss of jobs and population after that. In the postwar period after World War II, some residents moved to newer housing in suburban locations outside the city. In addition, General Electric established some high-tech facilities in the neighboring town of Niskayuna, which contributed to continuing population growth in the county. In the latter part of the 20th century, Schenectady suffered from the massive industrial and corporate restructuring that affected much of the US, including in the railroads. It lost many jobs and population to other locations, including offshore. Since the late 20th century, it has been shaping a new economy, based in part on renewable energy. Its population increased from 2000 to 2010.\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 11.0 square miles (28.49?km2), of which, 10.9 square miles (28.23?km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26?km2) of it (1.27%) is water.\\r\\nIt is part of the Capital District, the metropolitan area surrounding Albany, New York state's capital. Along with Albany and Troy, it is one of the three principal population and industrial centers in the region.\\r\\nThe city was a manufacturing center known as \\"The City that Lights and Hauls the World\\" ÿ a reference to two prominent businesses in the city, the Edison Electric Company (now known as General Electric), and the American Locomotive Company (ALCO). GE retains its administrative core in Schenectady, but it relocated thousands of manufacturing jobs to the Sun Belt and abroad.\\r\\nALCO produced steam locomotives for railroads for years. Later it became renowned for its \\"Superpower\\" line of high-pressure locomotives, such as those for the Union Pacific Railroad in the 1930s and 1940s. During World War II, it converted to support the war, making tanks for the US Army. As diesel locomotives began to be manufactured, ALCO joined with GE to develop diesel locomotives to compete with the EMD division of General Motors. But corporate restructuring to cope with the changing locomotive procurement environment saw the slow downward spiral of ALCO. Its operations fizzled as the company went through acquisitions and restructuring in the late 1960s. Its Schenectady plant closed in 1969.\\r\\nIn the late 20th century, due to industrial restructuring, the city lost many jobs and suffered difficult financial times, as did many upstate New York former manufacturing cities. The loss of employment caused Schenectady's population to decline by nearly one-third from 1950 into the late 20th century (see Census table). The early industries had left many sites contaminated with hazardous wastes. Such environmental brownfields have needed technical approaches for redevelopment.\\r\\nIn the 21st century, Schenectady began revitalization. GE established a renewable energy center that brought hundreds of employees to the area. The city is part of a metropolitan area with improving economic health, and a number of buildings have been renovated for new uses. Numerous small businesses, retail stores and restaurants have developed on State Street in the heart of downtown.[28]\\r\\nPrice Chopper Supermarkets and the New York Lottery are based in Schenectady. In December 2014, the state announced that Schenectady was one of three sites selected for development of Class III casino gambling, under terms of a state constitutional amendment passed by voters in 2013 that allowed such gaming in off-reservation sites. (Several federally recognized Native American nations in New York have gaming on their reservations.)[4]\\r\\nThe Schenectady project, to be called The Rivers Casino and Resort at Mohawk Harbor, will redevelop the old American Locomotive Company (ALCO) site, a brownfield along the waterfront. The mixed-use project will include a hotel and residential housing development, and a marina, in addition to the casino.[4] This will help create a variety of uses and a 24-hour population center.\\r\\nIn the census of 2010, there were 66,135 people, 26,265 (2000 data) households, and 14,051 (2000 data) families residing in the city. The population density was 6,096.7 people per square mile (2,199.9/km2). There were 30,272 (2000 data) housing units at an average density of 2,790.6 per square mile (1,077.2/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 59.38% (52.31% Non-Hispanic) (7.07 White-Hispanic) White, 24.19% African American, 14.47% Hispanic or Latin of any race, 8.24% from other races, 5.74% from two or more races, 2.62% Asian American, 0.69% Native American, and 0.14% Pacific Islander. There is a growing Guyanese population in the area. The top ancestries self-identified by people on the census are Italian (13.6%), Guyanese (12.3%), Irish (12.1%), Puerto Rican (10.1%), German (8.7%), English (6.0%), Polish (5.4%), French (4.4%). These reflect historic and early 20th-century immigration, as well as that since the late 20th century.[30]\\r\\nThe Schenectady City School District is very diverse; (71%- 2011)(80%ÿ2013) of district students receive free or reduced lunch. The student population of the school district is majority minority: 35% Black (48% Graduate), 32% White (71% Graduate), 18% Hispanic (51% Graduate), 15% Asian (68% Graduate). As of 2016, the graduation rate for the high school was 56%.[31]\\r\\nUsing 2010 data, there were 28,264 households out of which 31.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.0% were married couples living together, 24.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.5% were non-families. 38.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.23 and the average family size was 2.98.\\r\\nIn the city, the year 2010 population was spread out with 26.3% under the age of 18, 13.6% from 18 to 24, 30.7% from 25 to 44, 21.1% from 45 to 64, and 7.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females there were 92.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.4 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the city in 2000 was $29,378 (2010ÿ$37,436), and the median income for a family was $41,158. Males had a median income of $32,929 versus $26,856 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,076. About 20.2% of families and 25.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 41.5% of those under age 18 and 5.6% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nThe largest denomination is the Catholic church with 44,000 adherents, followed by the Muslims with 6,000 members. The third largest denomination is the Reformed Church in America with 3,600 members. The fourth is the United Methodist denomination with 2,800 members.[32]\\r\\nNotable congregations are the First Presbyterian Church (Schenectady, New York) which is affiliated with the PCA, First Reformed Church RCA is formed in the 17th century, one of the oldest churches in the town. St George's Episcopal Church dates back to 1735; it shared facilities with the Presbyterians more than 30 years .[33]\\r\\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides regular service to Schenectady, with a station at 322 Erie Boulevard. Schenectady also has freight rail service from Canadian Pacific Railway and CSX Transportation.\\r\\nSchenectady had a local streetcar system and electric interurban passenger service. The Schenectady Railway Co. had local lines and interurban lines serving Albany, Ballston Spa, Saratoga Springs and Troy. There was also a line from Gloversville, Johnstown, Amsterdam, and Scotia into Downtown Schenectady operated by the Fonda, Johnstown, and Gloversville Railroad. The nearly 200 leather and glove companies (178) in the Gloversville region generated considerable traffic for the line. Sales representatives carrying product sample cases would begin their sales campaigns throughout the rest of the country by taking the interurban to reach Schenectady's New York Central Railroad station, where they connected to trains to New York City, Chicago and points between.\\r\\nThe bright orange FJ&G interurbans were scheduled to meet every daylight New York Central train that stopped at Schenectady. Through the 1900s and into the early 1930s, the line was quite prosperous. In 1932 the FJ&G purchased five lightweight \\"bullet cars\\" (#125 through 129) from the J. G. Brill Company. These interurbans represented state of the art design: the \\"bullet\\" description referred to the unusual front roof that was designed to slope down to the windshield in an aerodynamically sleek way. FJ&G bought the cars believing that there would be continuing strong passenger business from a prosperous glove and leather industry, as well as legacy tourism traffic to Lake Sacandaga north of Gloversville. Instead, roads were improved, automobiles became cheaper and were purchased more widely, tourists traveled greater distances by car, and the Great Depression decreased business overall.\\r\\nFJ&G ridership continued to decline, and in 1938 New York state condemned the line's bridge over the Mohawk River at Schenectady. This bridge had once carried cars, pedestrians, plus the interurban, but ice flow damage in 1928 prompted the state to restrict its use to the interurban. When in 1938 the state condemned the bridge for interurban use, the line abandoned passenger service, and the bullet cars were sold.

The naturalism of its sculptures and stained glass serve to contrast it with earlier Romanesque architecture.\\r\\nAs the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Paris, Notre-Dame contains the cathedra of the Archbishop of Paris, currently Cardinal Andr Vingt-Trois.[4] The cathedral treasury contains a reliquary, which houses some of Catholicism's most important relics, including the purported Crown of Thorns, a fragment of the True Cross, and one of the Holy Nails.\\r\\nIn the 1790s, Notre-Dame suffered desecration in the radical phase of the French Revolution when much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. An extensive restoration supervised by Eugne Viollet-le-Duc began in 1845. A project of further restoration and maintenance began in 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNotre-Dame de Paris was among the first buildings in the world to use the flying buttress. The building was not originally designed to include the flying buttresses around the choir and nave but after the construction began, the thinner walls grew ever higher and stress fractures began to occur as the walls pushed outward. In response, the cathedral's architects built supports around the outside walls, and later additions continued the pattern. The total surface area is 5,500 m2 (interior surface 4,800 m2).\\r\\nMany small individually crafted statues were placed around the outside to serve as column supports and water spouts. Among these are the famous gargoyles, designed for water run-off, and chimeras. The statues were originally colored as was most of the exterior. The paint has worn off. The cathedral was essentially complete by 1345. The cathedral has a narrow climb of 387 steps at the top of several spiral staircases; along the climb it is possible to view its most famous bell and its gargoyles in close quarters, as well as having a spectacular view across Paris when reaching the top.\\r\\nJohn of Jandun recognized the cathedral as one of Paris's three most important buildings [prominent structures] in his 1323 Treatise on the Praises of Paris:\\r\\nIn 1160, because the church in Paris had become the \\"Parish church of the kings of Europe\\", Bishop Maurice de Sully deemed the previous Paris cathedral, Saint-tienne (St Stephen's), which had been founded in the 4th century, unworthy of its lofty role, and had it demolished shortly after he assumed the title of Bishop of Paris. As with most foundation myths, this account needs to be taken with a grain of salt; archeological excavations in the 20th century suggested that the Merovingian cathedral replaced by Sully was itself a massive structure, with a five-aisled nave and a fa?ade some 36m across. It is possible therefore that the faults with the previous structure were exaggerated by the Bishop to help justify the rebuilding in a newer style. According to legend, Sully had a vision of a glorious new cathedral for Paris, and sketched it on the ground outside the original church.\\r\\nTo begin the construction, the bishop had several houses demolished and had a new road built to transport materials for the rest of the cathedral. Construction began in 1163 during the reign of Louis VII, and opinion differs as to whether Sully or Pope Alexander III laid the foundation stone of the cathedral. However, both were at the ceremony. Bishop de Sully went on to devote most of his life and wealth to the cathedral's construction. Construction of the choir took from 1163 until around 1177 and the new High Altar was consecrated in 1182 (it was normal practice for the eastern end of a new church to be completed first, so that a temporary wall could be erected at the west of the choir, allowing the chapter to use it without interruption while the rest of the building slowly took shape). After Bishop Maurice de Sully's death in 1196, his successor, Eudes de Sully (no relation) oversaw the completion of the transepts and pressed ahead with the nave, which was nearing completion at the time of his own death in 1208. By this stage, the western facade had also been laid out, though it was not completed until around the mid-1240s.[6]\\r\\nNumerous architects worked on the site over the period of construction, which is evident from the differing styles at different heights of the west front and towers.[citation needed] Between 1210 and 1220, the fourth architect oversaw the construction of the level with the rose window and the great halls beneath the towers.\\r\\nThe most significant change in design came in the mid 13th century, when the transepts were remodeled in the latest Rayonnant style; in the late 1240s Jean de Chelles added a gabled portal to the north transept topped off by a spectacular rose window. Shortly afterwards (from 1258) Pierre de Montreuil executed a similar scheme on the southern transept. Both these transept portals were richly embellished with sculpture; the south portal features scenes from the lives of St Stephen and of various local saints, while the north portal featured the infancy of Christ and the story of Theophilus in the tympanum, with a highly influential statue of the Virgin and Child in the trumeau.[7]\\r\\nThe Archaeological Crypt of the Paris Notre-Dame (La crypte archologique du Parvis de Notre-Dame) was created in 1965 to protect a range of historical ruins, discovered during construction work and spanning from the earliest settlement in Paris to the modern day. The crypts are managed by the Muse Carnavalet and contain a large exhibit, detailed models of the architecture of different time periods, and how they can be viewed within the ruins. The main feature still visible is the under-floor heating installed during the Roman occupation.[8]\\r\\nIn 1548, rioting Huguenots damaged features of Notre-Dame, considering them idolatrous.[9] During the reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV, the cathedral underwent major alterations as part of an ongoing attempt to modernize cathedrals throughout Europe. A colossal statue of St Christopher, standing against a pillar near the western entrance and dating from 1413, was destroyed in 1786. Tombs and stained glass windows were destroyed. The north and south rose windows were spared this fate, however.\\r\\nIn 1793, during the French Revolution, the cathedral was rededicated to the Cult of Reason, and then to the Cult of the Supreme Being. During this time, many of the treasures of the cathedral were either destroyed or plundered. The 13th century spire was torn down[10] and the statues located at the west facade were beheaded.[11] Many of the heads were found during a 1977 excavation nearby and are on display at the Muse de Cluny. For a time the Goddess of Liberty replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.[12] The cathedral's great bells managed to avoid being melted down. The cathedral came to be used as a warehouse for the storage of food.[9]\\r\\nA controversial restoration programme was initiated in 1845, overseen by architects Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Lassus and Eugne Viollet-le-Duc. Viollet Le Duc was responsible for the restorations of several dozen castles, palaces and cathedrals across France. The restoration lasted twenty five years[9] and included a taller and more ornate reconstruction of the flche (a type of spire),[10] as well as the addition of the chimeras on the Galerie des Chimres. Viollet le Duc always signed his work with a bat, the wing structure of which most resembles the Gothic vault (see Chateau de Roquetaillade).\\r\\nThe Second World War caused more damage. Several of the stained glass windows on the lower tier were hit by stray bullets. These were remade after the war, but now sport a modern geometrical pattern, not the old scenes of the Bible.\\r\\nIn 1991, a major programme of maintenance and restoration was initiated, which was intended to last ten years, but was still in progress as of 2010,[9] the cleaning and restoration of old sculptures being an exceedingly delicate matter. Circa 2014, much of the lighting was upgraded to LED lighting.[13]\\r\\nThough numerous organs have been installed in the cathedral over time, the earliest models were inadequate for the building.[citation needed] The first more noted organ[citation needed] was finished in the 18th century by the noted builder Fran?ois-Henri Clicquot. Some of Clicquot's original pipework in the pedal division continues to sound from the organ today. The organ was almost completely rebuilt and expanded in the 19th century by Aristide Cavaill-Coll.\\r\\nThe position of titular organist (\\"head\\" or \\"chief\\" organist; French: titulaires des grands orgues) at Notre-Dame is considered one of the most prestigious organist posts in France, along with the post of titular organist of Saint Sulpice in Paris, Cavaill-Coll's largest instrument.\\r\\nThe organ has 7,952 pipes, with ca 900 classified as historical. It has 110 real stops, five 56-key manuals and a 32-key pedalboard. In December 1992, a two-year restoration of the organ was completed that fully computerized the organ under three LANs (Local Area Networks). The restoration also included a number of additions, notably two further horizontal reed stops en chamade in the Cavaille-Coll style. The Notre-Dame organ is therefore unique in France in having five fully independent reed stops en chamade.\\r\\nAmong the best-known organists at Notre-Dame de Paris was Louis Vierne, who held this position from 1900 to 1937. Under his tenure, the Cavaill-Coll organ was modified in its tonal character, notably in 1902 and 1932. Lonce de Saint-Martin held the post between 1932 and 1954. Pierre Cochereau initiated further alterations (many of which were already planned by Louis Vierne), including the electrification of the action between 1959 and 1963. The original Cavaill-Coll console, (which is now located near the organ loft), was replaced by a new console in Anglo-American style and the addition of further stops between 1965 and 1972, notably in the pedal division, the recomposition of the mixture stops, a 32' plenum in the Neo-Baroque style on the Solo manual, and finally the adding of three horizontal reed stops \\"en chamade\\" in the Iberian style.\\r\\nAfter Cochereau's sudden death in 1984, four new titular organists were appointed at Notre-Dame in 1985: Jean-Pierre Leguay, Olivier Latry, Yves Devernay (who died in 1990), and Philippe Lefebvre. This was reminiscent of the 18th-century practice of the cathedral having four titular organists, each one playing for three months of the year.\\r\\nThe cathedral has 10 bells. The largest, Emmanuel, original to 1681, is located in the south tower and weighs just over 13 tons and is tolled to mark the hours of the day and for various occasions and services. This bell is always rung first, at least 5 seconds before the rest. Until recently, there were four additional 19th-century bells on wheels in the north tower, which were swing chimed. These bells were meant to replace nine which were removed from the cathedral during the Revolution and were rung for various services and festivals. The bells were once rung by hand before electric motors allowed them to be rung without manual labor. When it was discovered that the size of the bells could cause the entire building to vibrate, threatening its structural integrity, they were taken out of use. The bells also had external hammers for tune playing from a small clavier.\\r\\nOn the night of 24 August 1944 as the ?le de la Cit was taken by an advance column of French and Allied armoured troops and elements of the Resistance, it was the tolling of the Emmanuel that announced to the city that its liberation was under way.\\r\\nIn early 2012, as part of a ?2?million project, the four old bells in the north tower were deemed unsatisfactory and removed. The plan originally was to melt them down and recast new bells from the material. However, a legal challenge resulted in the bells being saved in extremis at the foundry.[14] As of early 2013, they are still merely set aside until their fate is decided. A set of 8 new bells was cast by the same foundry, Cornille-Havard, in Normandy that had cast the four in 1856. At the same time, a much larger bell called Marie was cast in Asten, Netherlands by Royal Eijsbouts  it now hangs with Emmanuel in the south tower. The 9 new bells, which were delivered to the cathedral at the same time (31 January 2013),[15] are designed to replicate the quality and tone of the cathedral's original bells.\\r\\nUnder a 1905 law, Notre-Dame de Paris is among seventy churches in Paris built before that year that are owned by the French State. While the building itself is owned by the state, the Catholic Church is the designated beneficiary, having the exclusive right to use it for religious purpose in perpetuity. The archdiocese is responsible for paying the employees, security, heating and cleaning, and assuring that the cathedral is open free to visitors. The archdiocese does not receive subsidies from the French State.[17]\\r\\nThe cathedral is renowned for its Lent sermons founded by the famous Dominican Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire in the 1860s. In recent years, however, an increasing number have been given by leading public figures and state employed academics.\\r\\nThe north transept rose\\r\\nEmmanuel, the great bourdon bell, at the Notre-Dame de Paris\\r\\nA wide angle view of Notre-Dame's western fa?ade\\r\\nNotre-Dame's facade showing the Portal of the Virgin, Portal of the Last Judgment, and Portal of St-Anne\\r\\nA view of Notre-Dame from Montparnasse Tower\\r\\nA wide angle view of Notre-Dame's western facade\\r\\nThe Statue of Virgin and Child inside Notre-Dame de Paris\\r\\nNotre-Dame's high altar with the kneeling statues of Louis XIII and Louis XIV\\r\\nOne of Notre-Dame's well known gargoyle statues\\r\\nSouth rose window of Notre-Dame de Paris\\r\\nNotre-Dame at the end of the 19th century\\r\\nFlying buttresses of Notre-Dame\\r\\nMemorial tablet to the British Empire dead of the First World War\\r\\nTympanum of the Last Judgment\\r\\nStatue of Joan of Arc in Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral interior","field3":"Who is notre dame de paris dedicated to?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Graduation","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"The following is a list of episodes for the Disney Channel series Kim Possible, which aired from June 7, 2002 to September 7, 2007, with four seasons, 87 episodes and two TV movies produced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: All episodes in Season 1 were directed by Chris Bailey and the production code numbers follow the continuity of the episodes of the season.\\r\\nKim has to fit both missions and detention into her life after Ron inadvertently causes her to fail substitute teacher Mr. Barkin's \\"three strikes\\" tardy policy.\\r\\nGlobal Justice conducts an intensive study of Ron to determine whether he is the secret to Kim's success.

Attracting widespread attention, it was soon followed by other women's rights conventions, including the Rochester Women's Rights Convention in Rochester, New York, two weeks later. In 1850 the first in a series of annual National Women's Rights Conventions met in Worcester, Massachusetts.\\r\\nFemale Quakers local to the area organized the meeting along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was not a Quaker. They planned the event during a visit to the area by Philadelphia-based Lucretia Mott. Mott, a Quaker, was famous for her oratorical ability, which was rare for non-Quaker women during an era in which women were often not allowed to speak in public.\\r\\nThe meeting comprised six sessions including a lecture on law, a humorous presentation, and multiple discussions about the role of women in society. Stanton and the Quaker women presented two prepared documents, the Declaration of Sentiments and an accompanying list of resolutions, to be debated and modified before being put forward for signatures. A heated debate sprang up regarding women's right to vote, with many ÿ including Mott ÿ urging the removal of this concept, but Frederick Douglass, who was the convention's sole African American attendee, argued eloquently for its inclusion, and the suffrage resolution was retained. Exactly 100 of approximately 300 attendees signed the document, mostly women.\\r\\nThe convention was seen by some of its contemporaries, including featured speaker Mott, as one important step among many others in the continuing effort by women to gain for themselves a greater proportion of social, civil and moral rights,[3] while it was viewed by others as a revolutionary beginning to the struggle by women for complete equality with men. Stanton considered the Seneca Falls Convention to be the beginning of the women's rights movement, an opinion that was echoed in the History of Woman Suffrage, which Stanton co-wrote.[3]\\r\\nThe convention's Declaration of Sentiments became \\"the single most important factor in spreading news of the women's rights movement around the country in 1848 and into the future\\", according to Judith Wellman, a historian of the convention.[4] By the time of the National Women's Rights Convention of 1851, the issue of women's right to vote had become a central tenet of the United States women's rights movement.[5] These conventions became annual events until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the decades leading up to 1848, a small number of women began to push against restrictions imposed upon them by society. A few men aided in this effort. In 1831, Reverend Charles Grandison Finney began allowing women to pray aloud in gatherings of men and women.[6] The Second Great Awakening was challenging women's traditional roles in religion. Recalling the era in 1870, Paulina Wright Davis set Finney's decision as the beginning of the American women's reform movement.[6]\\r\\nStarting in 1832, abolitionist and journalist William Lloyd Garrison organized anti-slavery associations which encouraged the full participation of women. Garrison's ideas were not welcomed by a majority of other abolitionists, and those unwilling to include women split from him to form other abolitionist societies.\\r\\nA few women began to gain fame as writers and speakers on the subject of abolition. In the 1830s, Lydia Maria Child wrote to encourage women to write a will,[7] and Frances Wright wrote books on women's rights and social reform. The Grimk sisters published their views against slavery in the late 1830s, and they began speaking to mixed gatherings of men and women for Garrison's American Anti-Slavery Society, as did Abby Kelley. Although these women lectured primarily on the evils of slavery, the fact that a woman was speaking in public was itself a noteworthy stand for the cause of women's rights. Ernestine Rose began lecturing in 1836 to groups of women on the subject of the \\"Science of Government\\" which included the enfranchisement of women.[8]\\r\\nIn 1840, at the urging of Garrison and Wendell Phillips, Lucretia Coffin Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton traveled with their husbands and a dozen other American male and female abolitionists to London for the first World's Anti-Slavery Convention, with the expectation that a motion put forward by Phillips to include women's participation in the convention would be controversial. In London, the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage, and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns. In 1842 Thomas M'Clintock and his wife Mary Ann became founding members of the Western New York Anti-Slavery Society and helped write its constitution. When he moved to Rochester in 1847, Frederick Douglass joined Amy and Isaac Post and the M'Clintocks in this Rochester-based chapter of the American Anti-Slavery Society.[9]\\r\\nIn 1839 in Boston, Margaret Fuller began hosting conversations, akin to French salons, among women interested in discussing the \\"great questions\\" facing their sex.[10] Sophia Ripley was one of the participants. In 1845, Fuller published The Great Lawsuit, asking women to claim themselves as self-dependent.\\r\\nIn the 1840s, women in America were reaching out for greater control of their lives. Husbands and fathers directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation.[11] State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work.[11] In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 as an attempt to find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.[12]\\r\\nIn the fall of 1841, Elizabeth Cady Stanton gave her first public speech, on the subject of the Temperance movement, in front of 100 women in Seneca Falls. She wrote to her friend Elizabeth J. Neal that she moved both the audience and herself to tears, saying \\"I infused into my speech an Homeopathic dose of woman's rights, as I take good care to do in many private conversations.\\"[13]\\r\\nLucretia Mott met with Elizabeth Cady Stanton in Boston in 1842, and discussed again the possibility of a woman's rights convention.[9] They talked once more in 1847, prior to Stanton moving from Boston to Seneca Falls.[14]\\r\\nWomen's groups led by Lucretia Mott and Paulina Wright Davis held public meetings in Philadelphia beginning in 1846.[6] A wide circle of abolitionists friendly to women's rights began in 1847 to discuss the possibility of holding a convention wholly devoted to women's rights.[6] In October 1847, Lucy Stone gave her first public speech on the subject of women's rights, entitled The Province of Women, at her brother Bowman Stone's church in Gardner, Massachusetts.[15]\\r\\nIn March 1848, Garrison, the Motts, Abby Kelley Foster, Stephen Symonds Foster and others hosted an Anti-Sabbath meeting in Boston, to work toward the elimination of laws that apply only to Sunday, and to gain for the laborer more time away from toil than just one day of rest per week. Lucretia Mott and two other women were active within the executive committee,[16] and Mott spoke to the assemblage. Lucretia Mott raised questions about the validity of blindly following religious and social tradition.[17]\\r\\nOn April 7, 1848, in response to a citizen's petition, the New York State Assembly passed the Married Woman's Property Act, giving women the right to retain property they brought into a marriage, as well as property they acquired during the marriage. Creditors could not seize a wife's property to pay a husband's debts.[18] Leading up to the passage of this law, in 1846, supporters issued a pamphlet, probably authored by Judge John Fine,[19] which relied on its readers' familiarity with the United States Declaration of Independence to demand \\"That all are created free and equal?...\\",[19] and that this idea should apply equally to the sexes. \\"Women, as well as men, are entitled to the full enjoyment of its practical blessings\\".[19] A group of 44?married women of western New York wrote to the Assembly in March 1848, saying \\"your Declaration of Independence declares, that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. And as women have never consented to, been represented in, or recognized by this government, it is evident that in justice no allegiance can be claimed from them?... Our numerous and yearly petitions for this most desirable object having been disregarded, we now ask your august body, to abolish all laws which hold married women more accountable for their acts than infants, idiots, and lunatics.\\"[19]\\r\\nThe General Assembly in Pennsylvania passed a similar married woman's property law a few weeks later, one which Lucretia Mott and others had championed. These progressive state laws were seen by American women as a sign of new hope for women's rights.[18]\\r\\nOn June 2, 1848 in Rochester, New York, Gerrit Smith was nominated as the Liberty Party's presidential candidate.[20] Smith was Elizabeth Cady Stanton's first cousin, and the two enjoyed debating and discussing political and social issues with each other whenever he came to visit.[20] At the National Liberty Convention, held June 14ÿ15 in Buffalo, New York, Smith gave a major address,[21] including in his speech a demand for \\"universal suffrage in its broadest sense, females as well as males being entitled to vote.\\"[20] The delegates approved a passage in their party platform addressing votes for women: \\"Neither here, nor in any other part of the world, is the right of suffrage allowed to extend beyond one of the sexes. This universal exclusion of woman?... argues, conclusively, that, not as yet, is there one nation so far emerged from barbarism, and so far practically Christian, as to permit woman to rise up to the one level of the human family.\\"[20] At this convention, five votes were placed calling for Lucretia Mott to be Smith's vice-presidentthe first time in the United States that a woman was suggested for federal executive office.[20]\\r\\nMany members of the Religious Society of Friends, known as Quakers, made their homes in western New York state, near Seneca Falls. A particularly progressive branch lived in and around Waterloo in Seneca County, New York. These Quakers strove for marital relationships in which men and women worked and lived in equality.[11]\\r\\nThe M'Clintocks came to Waterloo from a Quaker community in Philadelphia. They rented property from Richard P. Hunt, a wealthy Quaker and businessman.[11] The M'Clintock and Hunt families opposed slavery; both participated in the free produce movement, and their houses served as stations on the Underground Railroad.[11]\\r\\nThough women Friends had since the 1660s publicly preached, written and led, and traditional Quaker tenets held that men and women were equals, Quaker women met separately from the men to consider and decide a congregation's business. By the 1840s, some Hicksite Quakers determined to bring women and men together in their business meetings as an expression of their spiritual equality.[11] In June 1848, approximately 200?Hicksites, including the Hunts and the M'Clintocks, formed an even more radical Quaker group, known as the Yearly Meeting of Congregational Friends, or Progressive Friends. The Progressive Friends intended to further elevate the influence of women in affairs of the faith. They introduced joint business meetings of men and women, giving women an equal voice.[11]\\r\\nLucretia and James Mott visited central and western New York in the summer of 1848 for a number of reasons, including visiting the Cattaraugus Reservation of the Seneca Nation and former slaves living in the province of Ontario, Canada. Mott was present at the meeting in which the Progressive Friends left the Hicksite Quakers. They also visited Lucretia's sister Martha Coffin Wright in Auburn, NY, where Mott also preached to prisoners at the Auburn State Penitentiary. Lucretia Mott's skill and fame as an orator drew crowds wherever she went.[22]\\r\\nAfter Quaker worship on Sunday July 9, 1848, Lucretia Coffin Mott joined Mary Ann M'Clintock, Martha Coffin Wright (Mott's witty sister, several months pregnant),[23] Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Jane Hunt for tea at the Hunt home in Waterloo. The two eldest M'Clintock daughters, Elizabeth and Mary Ann, Jr. may have accompanied their mother.[24] Jane Hunt had given birth two weeks earlier, and was tending the baby at home. Over tea, Stanton, the only non-Quaker present, vented a lifetime's worth of pent-up frustration, her \\"long-accumulating discontent\\"[25] about women's subservient place in society. The five women decided to hold a women's rights convention in the immediate future, while the Motts were still in the area,[2] and drew up an announcement to run in the Seneca County Courier. The announcement began with these words: \\"WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.A Convention to discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of woman\\".[2] The notice specified that only women were invited to the first day's meetings on July 19, but both women and men could attend on the second day to hear Lucretia Mott speak, among others.[2] On July 11, the announcement first appeared, giving readers just eight days' notice until the first day of convention.[26] Other papers such as Douglass's North Star picked up the notice, printing it on July 14.[2] The meeting place was to be the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel[27] in Seneca Falls. Built by a congregation of abolitionists and financed in part by Richard Hunt,[11] the chapel had been the scene of many reform lectures, and was considered the only large building in the area that would open its doors to a women's rights convention.[2]\\r\\nAt their home in Waterloo on Sunday, July 16, the M'Clintocks hosted a smaller planning session for the convention. Mary Ann M'Clintock and her eldest daughters, Elizabeth and Mary Ann, Jr., discussed with Stanton the makeup of the resolutions that would be presented to the convention for approval. Each woman made certain her concerns were appropriately represented among the ten resolutions that they composed.[28] Taken together, the resolutions demanded that women should have equality in the family, education, jobs, religion, and morals.[19] One of the M'Clintock women selected the Declaration of Independence from 1776 as a model for the declaration they wanted to make at their convention. The Declaration of Sentiments was then drafted in the parlor on a round, three-legged, mahogany tea table.[29] Stanton changed a few words of the Declaration of Independence to make it appropriate for a statement by women, replacing \\"The history of the present King of Great Britain\\" with \\"The history of mankind\\" as the basis for \\"usurpations on the part of man toward woman.\\"[30] The women added the phrase \\"and women\\" to make \\"...?all men and women are created equal?...\\"[30] A list of grievances was composed to form the second part of the Declaration.[31]\\r\\nBetween July 16 and July 19, at home on her own writing desk, Stanton edited the grievances and resolutions. Henry Brewster Stanton, a lawyer, politician and Stanton's husband, helped substantiate the document by locating \\"extracts from laws bearing unjustly against woman's property interests.\\"[31] On her own, Stanton added a more radical point to the list of grievances and to the resolutions: the issue of women's voting rights.[32] To the grievances, she added \\"He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise\\", and to the Sentiments, she added a line about man depriving woman of \\"the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation...\\"[32] Stanton then copied the Declaration and resolutions into final draft form for presentation at the meeting. When he saw the addition of woman suffrage, Henry Stanton warned his wife \\"you will turn the proceedings into a farce.\\"[33] He, like most men of his day, was not in favor of women gaining voting rights. Because he intended to run for elective office, he left Seneca Falls to avoid being connected with a convention promoting such an unpopular cause.[34] Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked her sister Harriet Cady Eaton to accompany her; Eaton brought her young son Daniel.[35]\\r\\nOn July 16, Lucretia Mott sent a note to Stanton apologizing in advance for James Mott not being able to attend the first day, as he was feeling \\"quite unwell\\".[36] Lucretia Mott wrote to say she would bring her sister, Martha Wright, and that the two women would participate in both days of the convention.[37]\\r\\nOn July 19, 1848, the morning of the first day of convention, the organizing committee arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before ten o'clock on a hot, sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors lockedan overlooked detail.[35] Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an open window so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.[35]\\r\\nStarting at 11 o'clock, Elizabeth Cady Stanton spoke first, exhorting each woman in the audience to accept responsibility for her own life, and to \\"understand the height, the depth, the length, and the breadth of her own degradation.\\"[35] Lucretia Mott then spoke, encouraging all to take up the cause. Stanton read the Declaration of Sentiments in its entirety, then re-read each paragraph so that it could be discussed at length, and changes incorporated. The question of whether men's signatures would be sought for the Declaration was discussed, with the vote looking favorable for including men, but the motion was tabled until the following day when men themselves could participate.[38] The first session adjourned at 2:30?p.m.[39]\\r\\nAfter a pause for refreshment in the 90 heat,[38] an afternoon session began with Stanton and then Mott addressing the audience. The Declaration of Sentiments was read again and more changes were made to it. The resolutions, now numbering eleven with Stanton's addition of women's suffrage, were read aloud and discussed. Lucretia Mott read a humorous newspaper piece written by her sister Martha Wright in which Wright questioned why, after an overworked mother completed the myriad daily tasks that were required of her but not of her husband, she was the one upon whom written advice was \\"so lavishly bestowed.\\"[40] Twenty-seven-year-old Elizabeth W. M'Clintock then delivered a speech, and the first day's business was called to a close.\\r\\nIn the evening, the meeting was opened to all persons, and Lucretia Mott addressed a large audience.[41] She spoke of the progress of other reform movements and so framed for her listeners the social and moral context for the struggle for women's rights. She asked the men present to help women gain the equality they deserved.[40] The editor of the National Reformer, a paper in Auburn, New York, reported that Mott's extemporaneous evening speech was \\"one of the most eloquent, logical, and philosophical discourses which we ever listened to.\\"[41]\\r\\nA larger crowd attended on the second day, including more men. Amelia Bloomer arrived late and took a seat in the upstairs gallery, there being none left in the main seating area. Quaker James Mott was well enough to attend, and he chaired the morning meeting; it was still too radical a concept that a woman serve as chair in front of both men and women.[40]\\r\\nAfter Mott opened the meeting, the minutes of the previous day were read, and Stanton presented the Declaration of Sentiments. In regard to the grievance \\"He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns,\\" Assemblyman Ansel Bascom stood to say that he had recently been at the New York State Assembly which passed the Married Woman's Property Act. Bascom spoke at length about the property rights it secured for married women, including property acquired after marriage.[40] Further discussion of the Declaration ensued, including comments by Frederick Douglass, Thomas and Mary Ann M'Clintock, and Amy Post; the document was adopted unanimously.[42] The question of men's signatures was solved by having two sections of signatures, one for women followed by one for men. One hundred of the 300[43] present signed the Declaration of Sentiments, including 68 women and 32 men.[44] Amelia Bloomer was one of the participants who did not endorse the Declaration; she was focused at that time on the temperance movement.[45] Ansel Bascom was the most conspicuous attendee who chose not to sign the Declaration.[46] The National Reformer reported that those in the audience who evidently regarded the Declaration as \\"too bold and ultra\\", including the lawyers known to be opposed to the equal rights of women, \\"failed to call out any opposition, except in a neighboring BAR-ROOM.\\"[41]\\r\\nAt the afternoon session, the eleven resolutions were read again, and each one was voted on individually. The only one that was materially questioned was the ninth, the one Stanton had added regarding women's right to vote. It read:\\r\\nResolved, that it is the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves their sacred right to the elective franchise.[47]\\r\\nThose who opposed this resolution argued that its presence would cause the other, more rational resolutions to lose support.[48] Others argued that only the social, civil and religious rights of women should be addressed, not the political rights.[33] James and Lucretia Mott were against the resolution; Lucretia said to Stanton, \\"Why Lizzie, thee will make us ridiculous.\\"[33] Stanton defended the concept of woman suffrage, saying women would then be able to affect future legislation and gain further rights.[33] Frederick Douglass, the only African American at the meeting,[49] stood and spoke eloquently in favor; he said that he could not accept the right to vote himself as a black man if woman could not also claim that right. Douglass projected that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere. \\"In this denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world.\\"[50] Douglass's powerful words rang true with many in attendance, and the resolution passed by a large majority.[42] Lucretia Mott spoke to end the session.[42]\\r\\nQuaker Thomas M'Clintock served as chair for the evening session, opening it at half-past seven.[42] The minutes were read, then Stanton spoke in defense of the many severe accusations brought against the much-abused \\"Lords of Creation.\\"[42] Following Stanton, Thomas M'Clintock read several passages from Sir William Blackstone's laws, to expose for the audience the basis of woman's current legal condition of servitude to man.[51] Lucretia Mott stood to offer another resolution: \\"Resolved, That the speedy success of our cause depends upon the zealous and untiring efforts of both men and women, for the overthrow of the monopoly of the pulpit, and for the securing to woman an equal participation with men in the various trades, professions and commerce.\\"[52] This, the twelfth resolution, passed.\\r\\nMary Ann M'Clintock, Jr. spoke briefly, calling upon woman to arouse from her lethargy and be true to herself and her God. Douglass again rose to speak in support of the cause of woman.[52] Lucretia Mott spoke for an hour with one of her \\"most beautiful and spiritual appeals\\".[52] Although Lucretia Mott's reputation as a speaker drew the audience, Mott recognized Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Mary Ann M'Clintock as the \\"chief planners and architects\\" of the convention.[11] To close the meeting, a committee was appointed to edit and publish the convention proceedings, with Amy Post, Eunice Newton Foote, Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., Elizabeth W. M'Clintock and Stanton serving.[11]\\r\\nLocal newspapers printed reports of the convention, some positive, others not. The National Reformer reported that the convention \\"forms an era in the progress of the age; it being the first convention of the kind ever held, and one whose influence shall not cease until woman is guaranteed all the rights now enjoyed by the other half of creationSocial, Civil and POLITICAL.\\"[41] The Oneida Whig did not approve of the convention, writing of the Declaration: \\"This bolt is the most shocking and unnatural incident ever recorded in the history of womanity. If our ladies will insist on voting and legislating, where, gentleman, will be our dinners and our elbows? Where our domestic firesides and the holes in our stockings?\\"[53]\\r\\nSoon, newspapers across the country picked up the story. Reactions varied widely. In Massachusetts, the Lowell Courier published its opinion that, with women's equality, \\"the lords must wash the dishes, scour up, be put to the tub, handle the broom, darn stockings.\\"[19] In St. Louis, Missouri, the Daily Reveille trumpeted that \\"the flag of independence has been hoisted for the second time on this side of the Atlantic.\\"[19] Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune wrote \\"When a sincere republican is asked to say in sober earnest what adequate reason he can give, for refusing the demand of women to an equal participation with men in political rights, he must answer, None at all. However unwise and mistaken the demand, it is but the assertion of a natural right, and such must be conceded.\\"[19]\\r\\nSome of the ministers heading congregations in the area attended the Seneca Falls Convention, but none spoke out during the sessions, not even when comments from the floor were invited. On Sunday, July 23, many who had attended, and more who had not, attacked the Convention, the Declaration of Sentiments, and the resolutions. Women in the congregations reported to Stanton, who saw the actions of the ministers as cowardly; in their congregations, no one would be allowed to reply.[54]\\r\\nSigners of the Declaration of Sentiments hoped for \\"a series of Conventions, embracing every part of the country\\" to follow their own meeting. Because of the fame and drawing power of Lucretia Mott, who would not be staying in the Upstate New York area for much longer, some of the participants at Seneca Falls organized the Rochester Women's Rights Convention two weeks later in Rochester, New York with Lucretia Mott as its featured speaker. Unlike the Seneca Falls convention, the Rochester convention took the controversial step of electing a woman, Abigail Bush, as its presiding officer. In the next two years, \\"the infancy?... of the movement\\",[55] other local and state women's rights conventions were called in Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.[56]\\r\\nCharlotte Woodward, alone among all 100 signers, was the only one still alive in 1920 when the Nineteenth Amendment passed. Woodward was not well enough to vote herself.[57]\\r\\nA stamp was issued in 1948 in remembrance of the Seneca Falls Convention, featuring Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Carrie Chapman Catt, and Lucretia Mott as part of a Centennial Celebration in Seneca Falls.\\r\\nThe Women's Rights National Historical Park was established in 1980, and covers a total of 6.83 acres (27,600 m2) of land in Seneca Falls and nearby Waterloo, New York, USA. The park consists of four major historical properties, including the Wesleyan Methodist Church, which was the site of the Seneca Falls Convention, Elizabeth Cady Stanton's home, and the M'Clintock House, which was where the Declaration of Sentiments, resolutions, and speeches were drawn up for the Seneca Falls Convention. The Wesleyan Methodist Church and the M'Clintock House were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\\r\\nIn 1998 First Lady Hillary Clinton gave a speech on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention.[58]\\r\\nIn 1870, Paulina Wright Davis authored a history of the antebellum women's rights movement, The History of the National Woman's Rights Movement, and received approval of her account from many of the involved suffragists including Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.[6] Davis' version gave the Seneca Falls meeting in 1848 a minor role, equivalent to other local meetings that had been held by women's groups in the late 1840s. Davis set the beginning of the national and international women's rights movement at Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850, at the National Women's Rights Convention when women from many states were invited, the influence of which was felt across the continent and in Great Britain.[6] Stanton seemed to agree; in an address to the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) convention in 1870, on the subject of the women's rights movement, she said \\"The movement in England, as in America, may be dated from the first National Convention, held at Worcester, Mass., October, 1850.\\"[59]\\r\\nIn 1876, in the spirit of the nation's centennial celebrations, Stanton and Susan B. Anthony decided to write a more expansive history of the women's rights movement. They invited Lucy Stone to help, but Stone declined to be part of the project; she was of the opinion that Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the divisive split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and, in 1881, they published the first volume of the History of Woman Suffrage, and placed themselves at each of its most important events, marginalizing Stone's contribution.[60]\\r\\nAccording to Lisa Tetrault, a professor of women's history, the Seneca Falls Convention was central to their rendition of the movement's history. Neither Stanton nor Anthony had been at the 1850 convention, which was associated with their rivals. Stanton, however, had played a key role at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, at which Stone had not been present. In the early 1870s, Stanton and Anthony began to present Seneca Falls as the beginning of the women's rights movement, an origin story that downplayed Stone's role. Pointing out that the women's rights movement could be said to have begun even earlier than Seneca Falls, Tetrault said the History of Woman Suffrage dealt with these earlier events relatively briefly in its first three chapters, the first of which is titled \\"Preceding Causes.\\"[61] In the volume, Stanton did not mention the Liberty Party's plank on woman suffrage pre-dating the Seneca Falls Convention by a month, and she did not describe the Worcester National Women's Rights Convention, organized by Stone and Davis in 1850, as the beginning of the women's rights movement. Rather, Stanton named the 1840 Anti-Slavery Convention in London as the birth of the \\"movement for woman's suffrage, in both England and America\\".[6] She positioned the Seneca Falls meeting as her own political debut, and characterized it as the beginning of the women's rights movement,[14] calling it \\"the greatest movement for human liberty recorded on the pages of historya demand for freedom to one-half the entire race.\\"[3] Stanton worked to enshrine the Declaration of Sentiments as a foundational treatise in a number of ways, not the least of which was by imbuing the small, three-legged tea table upon which the first draft of it was composed an importance similar to that of Thomas Jefferson's desk upon which he wrote the Declaration of Independence.[14] The M'Clintocks gave Stanton the table, then Stanton gave it to Susan B. Anthony on the occasion of her 80th birthday,[62] though Anthony had no part in the Seneca Falls meeting.[25] In keeping with Stanton's promotion of the table as an iconic relic, women's rights activists put it in a place of honor at the head of the casket at the funeral of Susan B. Anthony on March 14, 1906.[63] Subsequently, it was displayed prominently on the stage at each of the most important suffrage meetings until 1920,[62] even though the grievance and resolution about woman suffrage was not written on it.[31] The table is kept at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.[64]\\r\\nLucretia Mott reflected in August 1848 upon the two women's rights conventions in which she had participated that summer, and assessed them no greater than other projects and missions she was involved with. She wrote that the two gatherings were \\"greatly encouraging; and give hope that this long neglected subject will soon begin to receive the attention that its importance demands.\\"[3]\\r\\nHistorian Gerda Lerner has pointed out that religious ideas provided a fundamental source for the Declaration of Sentiments. Most of the women attending the convention were active in Quaker or evangelical Methodist movements. The document itself drew from writings by the evangelical Quaker Sarah Grimk to make biblical claims that God had created woman equal to man and that man had usurped God's authority by establishing \\"absolute tyranny\\" over woman.[65] According to author Jami Carlacio, Grimk's writings opened the public's eyes to ideas like women's rights, and for the first time they were willing to question conventional notions about the subordination of women.[66]","field3":"Where was the first woman's rights convention held?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Lloyd V.

It was founded on March 17, 1994 with the purchase of the Woolco Canada chain from the F. W. Woolworth Company.\\r\\nThe Walmart store in Whitby opened on May 24th 2000.\\r\\nOriginally consisting of discount stores, Walmart Canada's contemporaries include Hart Stores, and Giant Tiger. It also competes in many areas with Canadian Tire and Sears Canada. Walmart Canada's six Sam's Club stores (2006-2009, only in Ontario) competed with warehouse club Costco and hypermarket Real Canadian Superstore. Based on the success of the US format, Walmart Canada has focused on expanding Supercentres from new or converted locations, offering groceries which puts them in the same market as supermarket chains such as Loblaws, Real Canadian Superstore, Metro, Sobeys, Thrifty Foods, Safeway, Save-On-Foods, Country Grocer, Fairway Markets, Quality Foods, Co-op and others.\\r\\nWalmart Canada held grand openings of 15 supercentres in January 2016, completing its expansion plan for the company's fiscal year, ending January 31, 2016. As of January 31, 2017, Walmart Canada's total count is 410 stores, including 330 supercentres and 80 discount stores in every province and territory except for Nunavut.[2][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWal-Mart Canada was established in 1994 through the acquisition by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of 122 Canadian leases of Woolco, a troubled subsidiary of Woolworth Canada.[5][6] The same year, these Woolco stores were renovated and converted into the Walmart banner.[5] Wal-Mart did not acquire 22 other Woolco stores that were either unionized or had downtown locations. Some former Woolco stores were sold and re-opened as Zellers stores.[7]\\r\\nAll 16,000 former employees of the Woolco stores that Walmart acquired were retained, retrained, and given a five percent raise. Mario Pilozzi, a senior vice-president at Woolco when the deal was signed, eventually became CEO of Walmart Canada. Pilozzi, who retired in 2008, has proclaimed that he and \\"his management team took a limping chain and turned it into the Wal-Mart powerhouse that became a game-changer on the Canadian business scene. Retailers changed, Canadian manufactures faced demands and volumes they had not seen before, real estate transitioned from enclosed malls to big-box plazas\\".[8] Reflecting on the 1994 deal in 2013, a Walmart Canada spokesman was quoted as saying \\"Even though Woolco had seen better days and was struggling, there was still an enormous amount of talent in that company. I think that is one of the reasons Walmart has succeeded in Canada, is because we started with a fantastic team that we re-motivated.[9]\\r\\nBeginning in the fall of 2006, Walmart opened new Supercentres in Canadian cities.[10] Walmart Canada also operated Sam's Club stores in Ontario from 2003 to 2009.[11] On February 26, 2009, they announced that it would close all six of its Canadian Sam's Club locations.[12][13][14] This was part of Walmart Canada's decision to shift focus towards Supercenter stores, but some industry observers suggested that the operation was struggling to compete with Costco and the non-membership Real Canadian Superstore (known as Maxi & Cie in Quebec). Sam's Club also rebranded two unopened locations as new Walmart Supercentres.\\r\\nFrom originally taking over much of the Woolco chain, Walmart Canada has expanded and opened new stores. It grew to 260 stores by 2005, making it Canada's second-largest retail chain.[7]\\r\\nIn 2011, Walmart Canada acquired the leases of 39 Zellers stores from Target, originally one of the 189 leaseholds purchased from Hudson's Bay Company and slated for conversion to Target Canada stores.[15] Walmart Canada managed to convert and reopen some of the former Zellers stores before Target Canada's launch.[16] Unlike Walmart's 1994 move into Canada, Walmart Canada this time did not guarantee the jobs of the employees whose stores it was acquiring.[9]\\r\\nWalmart Canada launched the \\"Urban 90\\" format in 2012, a set of smaller Supercentres averaging 90,000?sq?ft (8,400?m2).[17]\\r\\nIn addition to the 11 Walmart Supercentres that opened across Canada in January 2015, Walmart Canada plans to complete another 29 Supercentres by the end of this year.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn May 8, 2015, following the bankruptcy of Target Canada, Walmart Canada announced its intent to acquire thirteen former Target locations, along with its distribution centre in Cornwall, Ontario subject to court approval. These locations include an unopened location at the Bayshore Shopping Centre in Ottawa.[18]\\r\\nWith the success of both Walmart in Canada and Walmart Supercenters in the United States, it was announced in late 2005 that the Supercentre concept would be arriving in Canada. On November 8, 2006, Canada's first three Supercentres opened in Hamilton, London, and Stouffville in Ontario.[19] Alberta became the second province with Supercentres in September 2008.[20] The first Supercentre in Vancouver, British Columbia opened in January 2009 in a former Costco/Price Club location, which moved to a new larger site nearby in Burnaby.[21]\\r\\nWalmart Supercentres range from 67,000 to 340,000?sq?ft (6,200 to 31,600?m2). Walmart Supercentres stock everything a Walmart Discount Store does, but also include a full-service supermarket, including meat and poultry, baked goods, delicatessen, frozen foods, dairy products, garden produce, and fresh seafood. Many Walmart Supercenters also feature a garden centre, pet shop, Axess Law office, pharmacy, Tire & Lube Express, optical centre, one-hour photo processing lab, portrait studio, a clinic and numerous alcove shops, such as cellular phone stores, hair and nail salons, video rental stores (including Redbox rental kiosks), local bank branches, and fast food outlets, Walmart Canada Bank launched its application for banking licence in 2008 to compete with similar stores in Canada such as Loblaw.[22] On July 24, 2009, Walmart Canada Bank was incorporated under the Bank Act in Canada.[23]\\r\\nWalmart Discount Stores are discount department stores varying in size from 51,000 to 150,000?sq?ft (4,738.1 to 13,935.5?m2), with the average store covering about 102,000?sq?ft (9,476.1?m2). They carry general merchandise and a selection of dried goods. Many of these stores also have a garden centre, pharmacy, Axess Law office, Tire & Lube Express, optical centre, one-hour photo processing lab, portrait studio, bank branch, cell phone store and fast food outlet, usually McDonald's (although stores that are in former Zellers locations typically do not contain a McDonald's). Walmart Discount Stores carry limited grocery items, which are limited mostly to dried goods.\\r\\nMost stores were converted into Supercentres in the late 2000s.\\r\\nWalmart Canada operated Sam's Club warehouse clubs in Ontario from 2006 to 2009.[11] On February 26, 2009, they announced that it would close all six of its Canadian Sam's Club locations.[12][13][14] Sam's Club also rebranded two unopened locations as new Walmart Supercentres. This was part of Walmart Canada's decision to shift focus towards supercenter stores. Some industry observers suggested that the Canadian Sam's Club never enjoyed the success of its American counterpart due to competition with Costco and the non-membership the Real Canadian Superstore (known as Maxi & Ci] in Quebec), as both chains that had a well-established history in Canada while Sam's Club was a late entrant.\\r\\nWalmart Canada has been criticized for using low prices to drive out rivals and local businesses. Within ten years of Walmart's entry into Canada, well-established retailer chains such as Zellers, The Bay, and Sears Canada have struggled, with Kmart Canada being sold to Zellers while Eaton's (whom Walmart Canada overtook to become Canada's largest retailer[26]) filed for bankruptcy. The continued difficulties of competing against Walmart Canada eventually led to HBC selling the leases of most Zellers stores to Target Canada, who also went out of business.\\r\\nIn June 2005, Vancouver City Council voted 8-3 to reject Wal-Mart's proposal to build its first store in the city, a 143,000?sq?ft (13,300?m2) store on Southeast Marine Drive. All eight Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) councillors against the project, while Mayor Larry Campbell and Non-Partisan Association (NPA) councillors, Sam Sullivan and Peter Ladner, were in favor. Wal-Mart's proposed store was designed by local architect Peter Busby for sustainable development, with windmills generating power and underground wells heating and cooling the building which would consume 1/3 the energy of a normal store, and it was endorsed by city planners and staffers. Councillor Anne Roberts stated that her opposition was due to potential traffic and congestion that the store would bring to south Vancouver, although she later remarked \\"I'm not a fan of Wal-Mart, and I've always been concerned about their labour practices, about getting goods from sweatshops\\".[27][28]\\r\\nLike its American parent, Walmart Canada has been the subject of criticism that it has engaged in practices that discourage associates from exercising their right to join a union and negotiate a collective bargaining agreement.\\r\\nWalmart Canada has been accused of undermining internet rights and freedom of speech, as a result of its June 2009 decision to seek an injunction against the Walmart Workers Canada campaign and its longstanding Walmart Workers Canada website[29] in particular, a labour rights website sponsored by United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada (UFCW Canada).\\r\\nIn Saskatchewan, Walmart fought unionization drivers at stores in Weyburn and North Battleford. The company's tactics eventually resulted in the Labour Relations Board imposing a fine and ordering them to hand over relevant documents, including the anti-union handbook for managers.[30]\\r\\nA Walmart store in Windsor, was unionized in 1997, but workers dissolved the union three years later after it failed to sign contract with management.[26]\\r\\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW), which had long been unsuccessful in unionizing Walmarts in the United States and much of Canada, was able to take advantage of Quebec's union-friendly laws to make some progress. These laws permit card check organizing, which gives unions more power than secret ballot organizing used in the rest of Canada, and mandates arbitration if the two sides fail to reach a contract.[31] The UFCW argued that union card-signing was more democratic than secret votes because \\"when there is a vote Wal-Mart uses intimidation tactics\\".[26] In addition, Quebec's labour relations board had ordered Wal-Mart Canada to stop \\"intimidating and harassing\\" cashiers at a store in Sainte-Foy, near Quebec City in the midst of an organizing drive.[26] Walmart has responded, mostly by shutting down unionized stores or stalling labour contract negotiations. For instance they closed their Saguenay, Quebec store, in April 2005 after workers unionized and just days before contract settlement by binding arbitration, putting 190 employees out of work. Walmart argued that the store wasnt profitable and the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed 6-3 on November 27, 2009 that the company had the legal right to close the store.[32] Walmart also closed its automotive centre in Gatineau, Quebec, after employees unionized and an arbitrator imposed a 33% wage increase.\\r\\nThere was the successful unionization by the UFCW of a Walmart store in Jonquire, Quebec in August 2004, as told in the documentary Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price. The initial card check organizing efforts fell one vote short, and in April 2004 a secret ballot to join the union was defeated 53% to 47%. However, when a group of managers gathered just outside the front door to celebrate for the TV cameras and taunt union supporters as they left the store, this spectacle offended many of the workers that originally voted against the union and caused them to switch sides, leading to a second and successful card check that unionized the store in August 2004. However, nine days of negotiation between the UFCW and Wal-Mart were fruitless, with the union accusing the company of not negotiating in good faith while Walmart argued that the union wanted the store to hire an additional 30 workers. Walmart closed the store five months later because the company did not approve of the new \\"business plan\\" a union would require, and this move was permitted by Quebec law as long as the closure was permanent.\\r\\nThis labour dispute between Walmart and the UFCW made headlines worldwide; three of the other forty-six Walmarts in the province of Quebec were temporarily closed by bomb threats, while a TV broadcaster likened Wal-Mart to Nazi Germany, and Saguenay mayor Jean Tremblay denounced the company as a \\"freebooting scofflaw\\". Walmart CEO H. Lee Scott Jr. argued that the Jonquire store was struggling, while polls in Canada showed that 9 of 10 Canadians believed that the store closure was mainly due to the unionization. A local newspaper columnist accused the UFCW leaders in Washington, D.C. of using the Jonquire store workers (in a city with chronically high unemployment, and whose stores had been wiped out by the opening of the Place du Royaume shopping mall in Chicoutimi) as \\"cannon fodder\\" to provoke a fight in order to incite public opinion against the Walmart, knowing that Walmart headquarters would not tolerate a unionized store.[7][33] In September 2005, the Quebec Labour Board ruled that the closing of a Walmart store amounted to a reprisal against unionized workers and has ordered additional hearings on possible compensation for the employees, though it offered no details.[34] Union organizers suggested that Walmart was making an example of the Jonquire store to pressure workers at other locations not to unionize.[26]\\r\\nAt the Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec Walmart, the 200 employees had organized successfully in January 2005 but contract negotiations stalled and an arbitrator was called in, finally reaching a two-year deal on April 9, 2009.[35] However the Saint-Hyacinthe contract was seen largely as a Pyrrhic victory for the UFCW, as the arbitrator portrayed \\"Wal-Mart as at least as good an employer-even a superior employer- compared with other retailers\\", noting that Walmart workers were paid more than their counterparts at Zellers. The union's calls for wage and benefit increases were all rejected, particularly their demand for an automatic-progression annual wage scales, as that would have conflicted with the company-wide annual performance evaluation, a key component of Walmart's business model. The arbitrator awarded existing workers (but not new hires) a small wage gain of 30S an hour to prevent them from being \\"impoverished\\" by dues paid to a union that failed to justify wages increases to the arbitrator.[31] In 2011, the Saint-Hyacinthe Walmart employees voted (147 out of 250) to decertify United Food and Commercial Workers as their representative union; it has been suggested that employees were disappointed in their union whose 2009 contract was tilted strongly in favour of their employer.[36][37]\\r\\nWal-Mart employees in Gatineau, Quebec joined the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) in 2008. This was followed by two years of stalled negotiations before an arbitrator imposed a collective agreement. In November 2011, after one year with their first collective agreement, the 150 Wal-Mart employees voted to decertify.[38]\\r\\nOn August 15, 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada cleared the way for Walmart employees in Weyburn, Saskatchewan who voted 51-5 to decertify United Food and Commercial Workers as their representative union. This left no unionized Wal-Mart stores in the whole of Canada.[36]\\r\\nOn July 14, 2015 Walmart Canada disabled their online photo site,[39] blaming a third party vendor, believed to be PNI Digital Media. Walmart's shutdown was followed shortly after by other companies suspending their photo site[40] whilst an investigation took place. In common with other potential victims[41] there was no confirmation or denial about whether hackers had stolen customer photographs as well as data and payment information. As of March 2016, the website does not offer online purchases, instead instructing customers to peruse photo services in-store. There is no set date as to when or if online services will return.[42]","field3":"How many stores does walmart have in canada?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Incandescence","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"This is a list of sources of light, including both natural and artificial processes that emit light.

While company headquarters remain in Louisiana, a second restaurant support office was opened in Plano, Texas in 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nTodd Graves first started dreaming of his very own restaurant in the early 1990s. Craig Silvey, an initial partner in Todd's plan, was enrolled in a business plan writing course at LSU at the time. They wrote the business plan and Silvey turned it in, for which Silvey received a \\"B-\\".[1] Although the business plan was rejected numerous times by potential investors, Graves set out to earn the money he needed to start the restaurant, first by working in refineries in California, then by fishing for sockeye salmon in Alaska. He and Silvey then obtained an SBA loan, which they used to open the first restaurant in Baton Rouge at the intersection of Highland Road and State Street near the LSU campus. They even drew on the help of friends and family for some of the work on Cane's 1, and many of these names are carved in the restaurant woodwork. Originally, the small restaurant competed against a similarly themed drive-in called Bailey's Chicken Fingers on the opposite end of the campus. By 1999, however, it was able to prove itself the more successful business: it forced Bailey's out of business, becoming the only chicken-finger focused restaurant in the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mid-1999, Silvey sold his stake to Graves to focus on completing an MBA at Wake Forest University and work in Silicon Valley. Later, Graves asked Silvey to return as vice president of finance and information technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2008, the chain had grown to over 50 locations. Most of the locations are in Louisiana, particularly in the Baton Rouge area. The first location outside of Baton Rouge was opened in 2001 in Lafayettesince then, new restaurants have been opened in 23 other states, in addition to all eight metropolitan areas of Louisiana. Graves plans to continue expansion of the chain throughout the United States and internationally, one each in Kuwait (opened September 2015) & Bahrain (opened September 2016), plus three in Saudi Arabia (first had opened February 2017), Lebanon (opened December 2017) & United Arab Emirates (opened in March 2018). Today there are over 390 stores in 24 states.[2] Tennessee opened one in Knoxville in September 2014. California has 12 West Coast stores, most of them in Orange County: the first opened in late October 2015 in Costa Mesa; the second in early December in Aliso Viejo; the third in early March 2016 in Orange; the fourth had opened in mid-June in Laguna Hills; the fifth opened in mid-February 2018 in La Habra, the state's 8th. There are two Los Angeles County stores: one in Downey (opened August 2016) and another in Lakewood (opened March 2018) which are the state's 4th & 9th, respectively. There is currently one under construction being built in the city of Pico Rivera, which will open in early 2019. Riverside County opened the state's 6th store in Riverside in October 2017. San Bernardino County's two stores are in San Bernardino, which opened in mid-January 2018, the state's 7th; the other is in Ontario, opened in early July, the state's 11th. San Diego County's two stores are in Santee, opened in May; another opened in Vista, in mid-July, the state's 10th & 12th, respectively. Besides Pico Rivera, 4 others are planned to open later in the year: Bakersfield, Menifee, Temecula & Upland.[citation needed] Kansas has 4 stores: one in Lawrence (opened May 2016); Overland Park (opened October 2016); Shawnee (opened August 2017) & Manhattan (opened June 2018). Iowa has two stores: one in Council Bluffs (opened October 2016) and another in West Des Moines (opened May 2018). Illinois has 6 stores, all but one in Cook County: they opened its very first in North Riverside, a Chicago suburb in late January 2017; the second opened in mid-February in Oak Lawn; the third opened in Naperville in late April; the 4th had opened in Harwood Heights in late September; the 5th had opened in Evergreen Park in late October; the Windy City itself opened one near Loyola campus in March 2018, the state's 6th. New Mexico's first location opened in Las Cruces in mid-February, the chain's 24th state; and will plan to open more in Albuquerque & Santa Fe in the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Panda Restaurant Group, led by mogul Andrew Cherng, the chain plans to add restaurants in Alaska & Hawaii later in the year.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2009, the company opened a second restaurant support office in Plano, Texas.[4]\\r\\nIn June 2011 it opened its 100th restaurant in Laurel, Mississippi. In February 2013 it opened its 150th location in San Antonio, Texas. The milestone 250th location opened in December 2015 in Lake Jackson, Texas. By November 2016 Houston, Texas hosted the milestone 300th restaurant's opening, on Rice & Westpark Tollway; and in late October 2017 Stillwater, Oklahoma was the site of the milestone 350th store.\\r\\n\\r\\nCEO Graves and the chain have given more than 25 percent of their profits back to the communities where restaurants operate with an emphasis on schools, food banks, active lifestyles, canine assistance and business and entrepreneur organizations.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nGraves and Silvey, who both worked as salmon fishermen in Alaska to raise money to open the first Raising Cane's restaurant, were going to name the chain Sockeye's Chicken Fingers, after the Sockeye salmon they fished for. They were later convinced to name it after Graves's dog, a yellow Labrador, \\"Raising Cane,\\" called \\"Cane\\" for short. The name is also a pun on the term \\"Raising Cain\\" or \\"Raise Cain\\", which is biblical reference to Cain and Abel in the Book of Genesis, and its a term meaning to cause havoc or create problems. \\"Raising Cane I\\" died of old age, Raising Cane II died on 11 September 2016, and the most recent mascot for the restaurant, Raising Cane III, was announced by Graves on 27 January 2018. [6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Raising Cane's was established in Baton Rouge, Louisiana at the North Gates of Louisiana State University, at the intersection of East State Street and Highland Road. When remodeling the building, Graves discovered a hand painted sign featuring the logo from a previous business, Wolf's Bakery, under the cracking plaster on the south interior wall. It is a takeoff on the one for the bakery. The remains are still visible and intact on the wall inside the restaurant.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaising Cane's offers a limited menu consisting of four main combos: \\"The Box Combo,\\" \\"The 3-Finger Combo,\\" \\"The Caniac Combo\\" and \\"The Sandwich Combo.\\" It also includes a Kid's Meal and several sizes of bulk chicken items called Tailgates.

He received the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Wesleyan University in 2015.[16]\\r\\nIn 2002, Miranda and John Buffalo Mailer worked with director Thomas Kail to revise In the Heights.[8][3] Book writer Quiara Alegra Hudes joined the team in 2004.[17] After success off-Broadway, the musical went to Broadway, opening in March 2008.[8] It was nominated for 13 Tony Awards, winning four, including Best Musical and Best Original Score.[1] It also won the 2009 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album.[2] Miranda's performance in the leading role of Usnavi earned him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Miranda left the cast of the Broadway production on February 15, 2009.[18]\\r\\nMiranda reprised the role when the national tour of In the Heights played in Los Angeles from June?23 to July?25, 2010.[19][20] He again joined the tour in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[21] Miranda rejoined the Broadway cast as Usnavi from December 25, 2010 until the production closed on January?9, 2011, after 29 previews and 1,185 regular performances.[22]\\r\\nMiranda created other work for the stage during this period. He wrote Spanish language dialogue and worked with Stephen Sondheim to translate into Spanish song lyrics for the 2009 Broadway revival of West Side Story.[23][24] In 2008, he was invited by composer-lyricist Stephen Schwartz to contribute two new songs to a revised version of Schwartz and Nina Faso's 1978 musical Working, which opened in May 2008 at the Asolo Repertory Theatre in Sarasota, Florida.[25]\\r\\nMiranda also did work for film and television. In 2007, he made a guest appearance on the television series The Sopranos in the episode \\"Remember When\\",[26] and in 2009, he played Alvie, Gregory House's roommate in a psychiatric hospital, in the two-hour season six premiere episode of House; he returned to the role in May 2010. He also has done work for Sesame Street, playing occasional roles and singing the theme song to the recurring segment Murray Has a Little Lamb.[27] He was a composer and actor for 17 episodes of the 2009 revival of The Electric Company[citation needed] and appeared in the CollegeHumor sketch \\"Hardly Working: Rap Battle\\", playing himself working as an intern and rapper.[28]\\r\\nDuring these years, Miranda also worked as an English teacher at his former high school, wrote for the Manhattan Times as a columnist and restaurant reviewer, and composed music for commercials.[29]\\r\\nMiranda co-wrote the music and lyrics for Bring It On: The Musical with Tom Kitt and Amanda Green. Bring It On premiered at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia in January 2011.[30][31] The musical began a US national tour on October 30, 2011 in Los Angeles, California.[32][33] It then played a limited engagement on Broadway at the St. James Theatre, beginning previews on July 12, and officially opening on August 1, 2012. It closed on December 30, 2012. It was nominated for Tony Awards in the categories of Best Musical and Best Choreography.[34]\\r\\nIn 2011, Miranda appeared on the TV series Modern Family in the episode \\"Good Cop Bad Dog\\".[35] He appeared as Charley in an Encores! staged concert of Merrily We Roll Along at New York City Center in February 2012. Later that year, he appeared in a small role in The Odd Life of Timothy Green as Reggie[citation needed] and played the recurring role Ruben Marcado on the 2013 NBC drama Do No Harm.[36]\\r\\nIn 2013, Miranda appeared in the episode \\"Bedtime Stories\\" (Season 9, Episode 11) on the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother.[37] Later that year, he submitted a six-song demo package to Walt Disney Animation Studios; in spring 2014, the studio hired him to help write the songs for its 2016 animated feature film, Moana.[38][39] In 2014, he performed with comedy duo The Skivvies,[40] and participated in This American Life at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on June 7, 2014 and broadcast on the radio on June 20, 2014, writing the music and lyrics for, and playing The Narrator in, the one-act 21 Chump Street: The Musical.[41] Also in 2014, Miranda appeared in the Encores! revival of Tick, Tick... Boom! under the artistic direction of Jeanine Tesori. The show was directed by Oliver Butler.[42] Miranda won a 2014 Emmy Award for co-composing (with Tom Kitt) the song \\"Bigger!\\", the opening number at the 67th Tony Awards in 2013.[43]\\r\\nIn 2008, while on vacation, Miranda read Ron Chernow's biography of Alexander Hamilton and, inspired by the book, wrote a rap about Hamilton that he performed for the White House Evening of Poetry, Music, and the Spoken Word, on May 12, 2009, accompanied by Alex Lacamoire. Miranda later said he spent a year writing the Hamilton song \\"My Shot\\", revising it countless times for every verse to reflect Alexander Hamilton's intellect.[44][45] By 2012, Miranda was performing an extended set of pieces, based on the life of Hamilton, referred to as the Hamilton Mixtape; the New York Times called it \\"an obvious game changer\\".[46]\\r\\nHamilton, a musical based on the Hamilton Mixtape, premiered off-Broadway at The Public Theater in January 2015, directed by Thomas Kail. Miranda wrote the book and score and starred as the title character.[47][48] The show received highly positive reviews,[49] and its engagement was sold out.[50] Chernow and Miranda received the 2015 History Makers Award from the New York Historical Society for their work in creating the musical.[51] The show began previews on Broadway in July 2015 at the Richard Rodgers Theatre and officially opened on August 6, 2015,[52] earning rave reviews.[53] On the first night of Hamilton previews over 700 people lined up for lottery tickets.[54]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Miranda contributed music for the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), writing a song for the scene in Maz Kanata's Cantina, an homage to the classic Mos Eisley Cantina scene and song.[citation needed] On January 24, 2016, Miranda performed the offstage cameo role of Loud Hailer in the Broadway production of Les Misrables,[55] fulfilling his childhood dream of being in the show, as it was the first production he ever saw on Broadway.[56] On March 15, 2016, members of the cast of Hamilton performed at the White House and hosted workshops; Miranda performed freestyle rap from prompts held up by President Obama.[57] In April 2016, Miranda and Jeremy McCarter published Hamilton: The Revolution, a book describing Hamilton's journey from conception to Broadway success and discussing the cultural revolution that permeates the show.[58]\\r\\nOn April 24, 2016, on the TV show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, at the end of a segment about the debt crisis in Puerto Rico, Miranda performed an emotional rap about allowing the island to restructure its debt.[59] In May 2016, Miranda received an honorary Doctorate of the Arts from the University of Pennsylvania and gave the commencement speech.[60] The same month, for his work in the role of Alexander Hamilton, Miranda received the Drama League Distinguished Performance Award.[citation needed] Miranda gave his last performance in Hamilton on July 9, 2016.[61] He vowed to return to the show.[62] A documentary about the creation of the show, Hamilton's America, featuring Miranda, premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 1, 2016 and first aired on PBS' Great Performances series on October 21, 2016.[63][64]\\r\\nFrom 2014 to 2016, Miranda collaborated with Opetaia Foa'i and Mark Mancina to write the music for Moana.[65] He later explained that because he was so busy with those two projects, he turned down other projects \\"that would have distracted\\" him, but this served as an \\"ego check\\" as Hamilton became a hit.[38] Miranda sings the song \\"We Know the Way\\" in the film. He also recorded a duet with Jordan Fisher of the song \\"You're Welcome\\", which is played over the film's end credits.[66] Moana opened to positive reviews in November 2016 and was a box office hit. Miranda's songwriting work was praised by critics,[citation needed] and he received Golden Globe, Critics Choice Award, and Academy Award nominations for the song \\"How Far I'll Go\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nMiranda hosted Saturday Night Live on October 8, 2016; in July 2017, he received an Emmy nomination for his appearance.[67] He is set to star in the Mary Poppins sequel Mary Poppins Returns, directed by Rob Marshall.[68] He is expected to serve as creative producer on Lionsgate's film adaptation of The Kingkiller Chronicle, along with a tie-in television series.[69] Miranda is producing eleven songs set to be used in the upcoming Sony Pictures Animation film, Vivo, which is being directed by Kirk DeMicco.[70] He is expected to voice Fenton Crackshell/Gizmoduck in the 2017 reboot of DuckTales.[71] He is also negotiating with Disney concerning a live-action film remake of The Little Mermaid, for which he may co-write additional songs (with Alan Menken).[72] However, in February 2017, Miranda told The New York Times that \\"We haven't formalized anything.\\"[38] As of July 2017, it has been confirmed he is working with Alan Menken.[73]\\r\\nMiranda married Vanessa Adriana Nadal, a high school friend, in 2010.[74] At the wedding reception, Miranda, along with the wedding party, performed the Fiddler on the Roof song \\"To Life\\";[75] the video has been viewed more than five million times on YouTube.[76] Nadal is a lawyer at the global law firm Jones Day.[77] Miranda and Nadal's son Sebastian was born in 2014. According to a 2015 interview on the podcast Can I Pet Your Dog?, Miranda has a dog named Tobi.[78][79] Miranda discovered that he is related to Residente and ILE of Calle 13 during a 2009 concert by the group in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where Miranda was invited to perform. Backstage, the mother of Residente and ILE revealed their connection to Gilberto Concepci܇n de Gracia, founder of the Puerto Rican Independence Party.[80] Miranda and Residente have since confirmed the relationship.[81] In 2017, Miranda performed on the opening track of Residente's self-titled debut album.[82]\\r\\nMiranda received an honorary degree from Yeshiva University, in Washington Heights, Manhattan, in 2009. He is the youngest person to receive an honorary degree from that university.[84] Former mayor of New York City, Ed Koch, presented Miranda with the degree.[citation needed] In 2015, Miranda received a MacArthur \\"Genius\\" Award.[85] In May of that year, he also received an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, Wesleyan.[86] The following year, after a meeting with President Barack Obama,[87] Miranda joined US Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Charles Schumer, Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic lawmakers to call for congressional action to back a Senate bill in Washington that would allow Puerto Rico to declare bankruptcy and significantly ease its $70 billion debt burden.[88]\\r\\nMiranda, a fan of My Brother, My Brother and Me on the Maximum Fun podcast network, has appeared on the podcast as a \\"guestpert\\"[89] and referenced the podcast in the Hamilton score.[90] Miranda wrote new lyrics to the song \\"Fugue for Tinhorns\\", from the musical Guys and Dolls, called \\"Fugue for Brotherhorns\\", for the podcast's hosts to perform.[89] Miranda has also referred to the podcast in his public appearances at the Grammy Awards[91] and on Saturday Night Live.[92] He is also a fan of the Comedy Bang! Bang! podcast on the Earwolf podcast network, on which he has appeared by telephone,[93] and of the TV drama The West Wing, rapping a tribute to the show in 2017.[94]\\r\\nAmong his numerous accolades, Miranda has won a Pulitzer Prize, three Tony Awards, two Grammys, an Emmy, and has been nominated for an Academy Award. He additionally was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship in 2015. In 2016, Time magazine included him in its annual Time 100 as one of the \\"Most Influential People in the World\\" and he received a star on the Puerto Rico Walk of Fame.[100][101] On June 22, 2017, it was announced that Miranda would be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2018.[102]","field3":"Who did lin manuel miranda play in hamilton?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"Arabian stallion","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Cass Ole (March 6, 1969 - June 29, 1993) was a Texan-bred Arabian stallion. Originally bred to be a show horse, he was National Champion in Arabian Western Pleasure in 1975, National Reserve Champion Arabian Ladies Side Saddle in 1976, and U.S. Top Ten Arabian English Pleasure in both 1975 and 1976. He won over 50 championships and over 20 Reserve Championships in his seven-year show career and was high point winner of the King Saud Trophy of the American Horse Show Association (now United States Equestrian Federation). He is best known for his role as The Black in the films The Black Stallion and The Black Stallion Returns, in which he is credited as Cass-Ol.\\r\\nHorse trainers Glen Randall and his sons J.R. and Corky Randall began their international search for a black Arabian to play The Black in the upcoming film. They found Cass Ole at his ranch in San Antonio, and his temperament and appearance suited him for the role. His owners stipulated that he was not to be used in the running or swimming scenes, so three other horses were obtained for use in those shots, as well as for stunts. Cass Ole and his fellow horse actors trained at a California ranch for several weeks before filming began. He had sessions with the young actor in the lead role, Kelly Reno, so the two could become familiar and get used to working with one another.\\r\\nCass Ole was naturally a black-colored horse, but he had white markings on his pasterns and a white star on his forehead which were dyed black for his screen time. (In the 2003 IMAX film, The Young Black Stallion, the horse cast for the role was actually a bay and his entire coat was dyed black.)\\r\\nHis mane as seen in the two movies was partially enhanced. Like many American horses, Cass Ole had his mane trimmed into a bridle path. While he did have a long mane typical for his breed, its natural length was about equal to the width of his neck, which is the average maximum length that a horse's mane will grow when not specially groomed. Therefore, to hide his bridle path trimming and to create the long flowing mane that was seen in the movie itself, hair extensions were stitched into his mane to provide a fuller and longer look on camera. To grow a mane past its natural length requires it to be kept in braids, regularly conditioned, takes at least a year's time to achieve significant length, and, like humans, some horses' manes simply will not grow beyond a certain length.\\r\\nAfter the two films had been released Cass Ole became a celebrity, showing up to be admired at fundraisers and special events. In 1980 he won the Humane Society Award for The Prevention of Cruelty To Animals at the International Horse Show in Washington, D.C. He visited the White House and was present at the Inauguration of President Reagan. He performed before audiences in Italy, Sardinia, Algeria, and Morocco. His last performance took place in the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington. His retirement show was under the direction of professional horse trainer George Gipson of Tenaha, Texas. He stood at stud at his home ranch in Texas, siring over 130 foals. None of them grew up to match his success.\\r\\nCass Ole was euthanized in 1993 after suffering from severe colic.","field3":"What type of horse was the black stallion?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"in the commune of Jou-du-Plain (Orne) in Normandy, France","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Chateau de la Motte is a chateau located in the commune of Jou-du-Plain (Orne) in Normandy, France. The chateau began as a Viking Motte-and-bailey castle and evolved into the 18th and 19th century Chateau seen today. The two most noted families who owned the site were the Gabriel Montgommerys and the Nicolas Angos, but its role as Resistance center in World War II may be its most notable episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong established Norman chateaus, like Chateau de la Motte, usually originate from motte-and-bailey castles constructed during the earliest Norman period in the 10th and 11th centuries. The bourgeois Ango family built much of Chateau de la Motte in the late 16th and early 18th century. They bought the original chateau from one of the most noted names in Normandy: the descendants of Gabriel de Montgomery I (Montgommery). In 1559, Montgomery had accidentally killed King Henry II of France in a joust.\\r\\n\\r\\nChateau de la Motte sits at the end of a long chestnut tree alley or avenue linking to the commune of Jou-du-Plain and the village of couch. The chateau's former farm, with an arched entry and coat-of-arms may have been the original chateau built in the 1660s. Today's chateau and a number of buildings have dates from the early 1820s, after restorations from the Deschamps family following the French Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Second World War, the chateau operated as a dairy and holiday home for Paris prostitutes. However, at the same time it functioned as headquarters for the Resistance. Escaping Allied pilots and an important arms depot were hidden here. The discovery of the depot by the Germans caused the assassination of the local mayor, and an unresolved crime, the subject of two criminal investigations and one book.\\r\\n\\r\\nChateau de la Motte takes its name from the small-forested rise next to the current house, called a motte (\\"clod of earth\\" in Old French). The small mound is the remains of a Viking/Norman motte-and-bailey castle (motte castrale, motte fodale in Old French). Mottes were made throughout France and Europe from the 10th century until the early 13th century, with many sites carrying the title of La Motte, Les Mottes, Fort de la Motte, or Chateau de la Motte.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nMottes often sat on Roman villa sites because water sources and strategic location needs were the same in both eras. Although numerous villa ruins were found nearby with the recent A88 autoroute construction, it is unknown whether this site was occupied before the Vikings, absent archaeological excavation.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chateau's site, including orchard and farm, has seven sources of water. Like most chateaus and mottes, this was likely the main consideration for the location. Wells and water management were important from earlier times as most drinking sources were contaminated, and sufficient water for animals was critical, even in rain-soaked Normandy. Water pollution was a known source of sickness from antiquity onward, although poorly understood.[3]:74, 90\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 15th century, when chateaus lost their defensive function, moats fulfilled prestige and aesthetic roles as well as providing fishponds, an important source of protein for peasants.[3]:76\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first mention of Chateau de la Motte is a letter from Guillame Lesor in 1217, asking to be a vassal of the French King. This letter followed the loss by King John of England (1199ÿ1216) at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, forcing an English withdrawal from \\r\\nNormandy.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first motte and bailey forts were built to defend Viking/Norman power in Normandy, as the lords of Maine in the south, and Brittany, to the west, occasionally intruded in force. The river Orne was the southernmost Norman boundary for much of the 10th century, and was defended by a series of mottes, usually in groups.[5][6]:28\\r\\n\\r\\nMotte and bailey castles usually had two main parts, both surrounded by wet or dry moats, then a wooden palisade. First constructed was the motte, or earthmound topped by a wooden tower. The tower was a last defense in an attack, and sometimes the lord's residence. The bailey contained barns, barracks, blacksmithy, chapel and other support structures. A removable wooden bridge linked the tower to the courtyard and a single fortified gate welcomed the visitor crossing the moat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe motte may have been similar to one excavated nearby at Land de Goult, near Carrouges. Archeologists uncovered a lower court 50ÿ80 meters (55ÿ87?yd) across. The motte was 40ÿ60 metres (130ÿ200?ft) across at the base, with a flattened top for the tower 10ÿ20 metres (33ÿ66?ft) high and 15ÿ20 metres (49ÿ66?ft) wide at the top.[5]:29\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter William the Conqueror's death, his sons revived motte making in the area to consolidate power from nearby Chateau of Falaise and Argentan. Lords continued building motte and bailey castles in the region throughout the ongoing feudal anarchy, until the mid 12th century. Thus, Chateau de la Motte may have originated close the letter's date of 1217.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 11th century a large stone tower (fr.grosses tour, grande tour, or tour ma?tresse) was sometimes built over a water source, and the support buildings lined inside were attached to its circular wall. Stone for these structures would have been fieldstone and not cut; however, much of the structures may have been wood, or wattle and dab, not stone. Like mottes, most exterior wooden walls would have been coated in plaster to reduce fire worries, and making them resemble stone buildings.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nChateau de la Motte, like most small chateaus, was most probably little more than a farm, possibly fortified during the Middle Ages. The king, or the duke of Normandy, had to give permission for building fortifications; towers, moats, and crenellations required licenses. Instead, rural architecture evolved a defensive function with buildings in compounds, built around a courtyard with water. The exterior walls had few windows, with an easy-to-defend entrance.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nCareful orientation toward the south, like most country architecture in France, was moderated on the Atlantic coast, in order to block the storms from the southwest. Today's gatehouse or dependence protects the chateau from the weather as well. The walls surrounding the grounds created microclimates, as well as defense, as intended. The rooftops deflect the winds upward, away from the residence.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lord's dwelling would have been a modest structure from the 11th to 16th centuries, even if the home were referred to as a Great Hall (la grande salle). The home would have at least two levels with storage on the ground floor and a large public room (l'aula) on the first floor, which was the actual great hall. This hall would have been a judicial, political, and economic center for the community, or parish (now commune), and located near the entrance to the Chateau grounds. A lord's private chamber (la camera) would have been at one end, with true privacy only in the large curtained bed. The chapel (la capella) was typically near, or in, the home, but no site is known today.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Middle Ages, a lord's family usually moved between their various lands and residences, leaving the maintenance and farm production to a permanent staff. It was sort of a mandatory, perpetual picnic.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nA noble household consisted of an extended family including many illegitimate half brothers and sisters, along with descendants from previous mixed offspring. A mother's status determined the roles in the family, with many positions as administrators and servants. Strategic marriages with other families were sought to defend the family's power and prestige, but a lord's daughter by other than his wife could marry a high servant. Sons were expected to leave the family for service in other lords homes.[13]:21ÿ29\\r\\n\\r\\nA modest chateau had between 10 and 20 servants: farm and household staff such as shepherds, ditchers, cow herders, milkmaids, and cooks. Most pay was in-kind, such as food and clothes.[13]:14ÿ21\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of the construction, probably no comfortable home existed at Chateau de la Motte until the 17th century. King Henry IV visited the region in 1579, and stayed in an inn five kilometers away in couch, because there was no place suitable for him nearby.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the inspiration of Versailles, chateaux de chasse (hunting chateaus/lodges) became popular as country retreats, with the hunt as the theme. These chateaus featured grand architecture, beautiful gardens, select majestic and exotic trees, greenhouses (orangeries) for luxuriant smells and spices, and grand entrances. A Google Earth view of the Chateau reveals an ancient hedge-line, or tree alley, leading from the current Chateau's gates to the Forest of la Motte (bois de la motte).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe existing majestic lime trees (tilleul) near the house and ponds may have been originals or descendants of those planted by previous lords as limes gave prestige and the grandeur of shade. Traditionally they were often planted in the courtyards center as symbols of high justice.[3]:76\\r\\n\\r\\nNorman nobility originated as loyal friends and family of William the Conqueror. In turn, their knights and retainers became the petite nobility (petite noblesse), usually barons, which filled out the need for local authority and management. Early Chateau la Motte lords probably were among these nobles.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe known owners are taken from the original charter, which existed at the time of the writing of the book, Histoire du bourg d'couch By Alfred Caix in 1867.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most famous owner of the Chateau de la Motte was Gabriel de Montgommery II, who acquired the Chateau by marriage. His father, of the same name, was the commander of the Scottish Guard; he accidentally killed King Henry II of France in a jousting tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tragedy occurred during a joust celebrating the Peace of Cateau-Cambrsis treaty with the Habsburgs, which ended the Italian War of 1551-1559, and a marriage of the king's daughter. Gabriel de Montgommery I (1530ÿ1574) killed the King Henry II of France when Montgommery's splintered lance sheared through the King's helmet visor and thrust into his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King took 10 days to die, and although Montgommery was pardoned twice from the King's deathbed, he fled the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young King's death shook Europe, and made the reputation of the prognosticator Nostradamus, whose recent words seemed to foretell the event.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe top sentence was actually added much later, but the last two lines attracted the popular attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nMontgommery converted to Protestantism in England. Ironically, his job as commander of the Scottish Guard in France was to search out Huguenots (French Protestants), as well as protect the King's life. He returned to France to lead numerous military campaigns in the Wars of Religion for the Protestants. His son, Gabriel de Montgommery II, and eventual owner of Chateau de la Motte, also became a Protestant commander, before and after his father's capture at a siege at Domfront and subsequent beheading.\\r\\n\\r\\nGabriel de Montgommery I, became a romantic figure linked to a book attributed to Alexander Dumas, The Two Dianas; a French movie; and the Tour Montgommery at Paris Conciergerie, where Queen Marie Antoinette was imprisoned before being guillotined.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe son, Gabriel II was forgiven in the treaty of 1576, before his marriage to Suzanne de Bouquetot in 1593, daughter of the Baron of couch. He thus became the Lord of Chateau de la Motte.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Montgommerys probably did not build at La Motte, but visited the area often, and possibly had a home in couch, which still exists.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year after Nicolas Ango's death (1654) his widow bought Chateau de la Motte and began building the farmhouse. Numerous other properties in Jou-du-Plain were also purchased, such as the nearby 16th-century manor Haut Mesnil, in order to fulfill the requirements of the acquiring the title of Marquis. Nicolas couldnt attain the title himself, it went to his son, Jean-Baptist after the requisite amount of land was purchased. The title stayed with whoever owned the land afterward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese titles were referred to as Lords of the Robe, as opposed to the old aristocracy, like Montgommery, who were called Lords of the Sword, who often had titles dating back to William the Conqueror.\\r\\n\\r\\nNicolas Ango was a wealthy bourgeois, and a Counselor to the King. The family had already built the private mansion hotel particulier, across from St. Germain Church in Argentan.\\r\\n\\r\\nPurchase of the title marquisat brought income to the depleted royal treasury of Louis XIV, but Jean-Baptist Ango earned the King's favor by buying and closing the Huguenot temple property in Jou-du-Plain. Louis XIV had begun the unpopular process of enforcing the law of making every Christian become a Catholic. Ango's action saved the King an unpleasant job.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nJean-Baptist Ango married Marie LeFevre of Lezeau, daughter of Nicolas Le Fevre, advisor to the Parliament of Rouen. On the 18th century Casini map, Marquis de la Motte- Ango was the Chateau's title.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ango source of wealth was unclear; he may have been a lawyer. Many new-rich rose rapidly as merchants, financiers, lawyers, and doctors during the Hundred Years' War and Wars of Religion, because many male aristocrats had died. Louis XIV chose his most trusted servants from among the rising bourgeois and small nobles; two examples were Vauban for fortifications and Colbert for finances.  Bourgeois were usually defined as professionals who did not work with their hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew lords, like the Angos, revived the ideals of country life. Jean-Baptist Ango built what would be the main residence around 1700, and probably the remainder of La Motte's buildings and walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe son, Ren-Phillipe de la Motte-Ango, married Antoinette de Dame Pellev Flers. He became the Lord of Chateau de Flers after the premature deaths of her two uncles; the first uncle from a duel and the second from a horse-fall. The imposing granite Chateau de Flers is near the town center, and open to the public. Through skillful management, the Fler branch of the family became one of the wealthiest in France.\\r\\n\\r\\nJean Baptiste Ango IV sold the Chateau just before the beginning of the French Revolution. A letter from Voltaire  declined the ownership of the Chateau in place of payment of a debt of only a 1000 cu in 1758. The letter said the lands had been poorly managed and systematically pillaged by the local peasants.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Revolution, like most chateaus, it was probably pillaged but not burned, as portrayed in popular imagination. No useful records survive from the time. Normandy was not strongly partisan during the period. An interim manager sold off stone from the main house to nearby farms.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1820 the prominent Deschamps family bought the Chateau and built the existing home, dated at 1821-22. The barn and the orchard house have similar dates chiseled over the entrances, indicating substantial reconstruction by the family.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndr Champrepus, the grandson of the original Deschamps, remembered as poor, portly and single, was the last Marquis. He died at the outbreak of the Second World War. Locals recall visiting the body presented in the Chateau's tower, and the nephew paying all the communes taxes that year, a custom among the nobility from the Middle Ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonor Jean Noel bought the Chateau as a retreat for his employees. He owned a caf clos, or house of prostitution, in Paris. The enterprising Noel with his wife and family live at the Chateau, and they rented out the farmland with most of the buildings. Locals recall his bringing his young women there for short breaks \\"to get a tan\\". He provided ponies and carts for the employee to explore the Chateau's grounds. He also owned two caf clos in Argentan. Locals referred to him as Pre Noel, and they recall his Proven?al accent along with a Mdm. Julos, a loud, tattooed woman that was a permanent member of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmile Buffon, a well liked local man who soon became mayor of Jou-du-Plain rented the Chateau's farm. Mayors had the delicate jobs of negotiating between German demands and local resentments. This mayor's job made the position more difficult as he worked as an animal dealer. Buffon had to gather the farm animals of local farmers for the German army, as agreed to in the treaty of the French defeat. No farmer wanted to give up his best animals for Nazi diners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Normans in the countryside ate much better than the city dwellers throughout the War. Forward thinking Parisians made agreements with the farmers for food supplies to be sent on the train weekly.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal people knew things were about to change. Before 1944, Germany stationed most of its troops in towns and cities, and ignored the countryside. The dreaded Gestapo, or Nazi internal police, only came to Normandy in force after January 1944. Until then, most troops stationed in France were older or ill-suited for combat. As the soldiers left, they warned the local French that their replacements would not be like them. Instead, the replacements would be young, intensely indoctrinated in Nazi ideology, and brutally battle hardened by combat on the Russian Front. These were the Waffen SS.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the days leading up to D-Day Europe, air battles in the Norman clouds became more common. The Allies needed experienced pilots. Airmen that survived shooting down made every effort to make contact with Rsistance forces. With French help, the pilots were to cross France to neutral Spain in order to return to Great Britain to fly and fight again.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 30, 1944, Charles Moore was flying his P-51 Mustang back from escorting bombers over Germany when four Messerschmitt 109 fighters attacked. He thought he had escaped, but realized he was losing altitude. He leapt from his plunging plane over couch. Madame Cavelot, a schoolgirl at the time, remembers seeing his parachute float above the countryside and a truck loading up with German soldiers to bring him in. Two young French boys found him moments before the soldiers did and led him to the Resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoore recalled later that he did not know all the places he hid with the Resistance, but postwar memoires indicated he stayed in Chateau de la Motte. Others probably did as well, but no records survive saying whom. He recalled being smuggled to a new hideout by Denise Bachelier (sister to dairy owner and Resistant Jacques Bachelier). She returned home to find Germans waiting for her. It was May 21.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nDenise Bachelier had entered one of the enduring mysteries and tragedies of Jou-du-Plain during World War II, and the subject of a book and two investigations. It was a tragedy for her as well; the Germans sent her and her 18-year-old younger brother to concentration camps, her brother did not survive: he died shortly after being freed.\\r\\n\\r\\nChateau de la Motte was an arms depot for the Rsistance, but its discovery by the Nazis brought an accusation of collaboration to the mayor of Jou-du-Plain. His assassination followed, possibly ordered by his brother. The events took place in and around the Chateau de la Motte.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day of the mayor's assassination, 16 July, just before dawn, a German Messerschmitt 109 fighter smashed into the large pond at Chateau de la Motte. The pilot, Haibt Oswald, died immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crash illustrated the desperate situation the occupying army faced. Corporal Oswald was based near Chartres. He died along with two others shot down that day from his outnumbered and out-fueled group. Not only did he die on his first combat mission, but he probably had only four hours of total flying experience. German fuel shortages meant no fuel to practice; it was a costly on-the-job training.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that same dogfight, Canadian Michael O'Kelly was a casualty from Britain's Royal Air Force. He is the only Allied soldier in the graveyard at couch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allies under General George Patton approached from the south, but the German occupiers continued local oppression, by managing a withdrawal across the Rhine to mount a final defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter finding the arms depot, the Germans occupied the Chateau with soldiers living in the farmhouse and officers in the main house. The Germans installed a bakery on the Chateau farm grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Noel continued distributing rationing coupons for several years after the war, as shortages continued. Noel's son and some of the female employees followed the Allied armies into Germany. The girls' school closed and the schoolmistress left, to rejoin her German boyfriend in Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974, Fauvre, a Peugeot engineer bought La Motte along with his wife and their son.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986, after Fauvre's death, Rhoisin Beresford, an Irish film director and the former wife of Bruce Beresford bought the Chateau from the son. Beresford was a noted director of Driving Miss Daisy and Terms of Endearment. Because of her media links, numerous British notables passed through la Motte, including the heroine in the movie The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc starring Milla Jovovich, filmed in nearby Ses.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 26, 1999, the chateau suffered major tree damage from the Lothar Storm. The majority of the remaining heritage trees (with the notable exception of the lime trees) from the 18th century Chateau planting were lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, the current owner bought La Motte.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nMedieval tile\\r\\n\\r\\nFireplace mantel detail\\r\\n\\r\\nUnusually fine barn doorway\\r\\n\\r\\nTile from Orangerie\\r\\n\\r\\nBarn door\\r\\n\\r\\nWall of sheep bones\\r\\n\\r\\nSheep bone imbedded in the wall for supporting grape vines.

The attack on Pearl Harbor and the island of O?ahu led to the United States' direct involvement in World War?II.\\r\\nThe memorial, built in 1962, is visited by more than two million people annually.[1] Accessible only by boat, it straddles the sunken hull of the battleship without touching it. Historical information about the attack, shuttle boats to and from the memorial, and general visitor services are available at the associated USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center, which opened in 1980 and is operated by the National Park Service. The battleship's sunken remains were declared a National Historic Landmark on May 5, 1989.[2]\\r\\nThe USS Arizona Memorial is one of several sites in Hawaii and elsewhere that are part of the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring and following the end of World War II, the Arizona's wrecked superstructure was removed and efforts began to erect a memorial at the remaining submerged hull. The Pacific War Memorial Commission was created in 1949 to build a permanent memorial in Hawaii. Admiral Arthur W. Radford, commander of the Pacific Fleet attached a flag pole to the main mast of the Arizona in 1950 and began a tradition of hoisting and lowering the flag. In that same year a temporary memorial was built above the remaining portion of the deckhouse.[3] Radford requested funds for a national memorial in 1951 and 1952 but was denied because of budget constraints during the Korean War.\\r\\nThe Navy placed the first permanent memorial, a ten-foot-tall basalt stone and plaque, over the mid-ship deckhouse on December 7, 1955.[4] President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved the creation of a National Memorial in 1958. Enabling legislation required the memorial budgeted at US$500,000 be privately financed; however, $200,000 of the memorial cost was government subsidized.\\r\\nPrincipal contributions[5] to the memorial included:\\r\\nDuring planning stages, the memorial's purpose was the subject of competing visions. Some were eager to keep it a tribute to the sailors of the Arizona, while others expected a dedication to all who died in the Pacific theater.[8] In the end, the legislation authorizing and funding the memorial (HR 44, 1961) declared that the Arizona would \\"be maintained in honor and commemoration of the members of the Armed Forces of the United States who gave their lives to their country during the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941.\\"[9][8]\\r\\nThe national memorial was designed by Honolulu architect Alfred Preis who was detained at Sand Island at the start of the war as an enemy of the country because of his Austrian birth.[10] The United States Navy specified the memorial be in the form of a bridge floating above the ship and accommodating 200 people.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe 184-foot-long (56?m) structure has two peaks at each end connected by a sag in the center of the structure. It represents the height of American pride before the war, the nation's sudden depression after the attack and the rise of American power to new heights after the war. Critics initially called the design a \\"squashed milk carton\\".[11]\\r\\nThe architecture of the USS Arizona Memorial is explained by Preis as, \\"Wherein the structure sags in the center but stands strong and vigorous at the ends, expresses initial defeat and ultimate victory?... The overall effect is one of serenity. Overtones of sadness have been omitted to permit the individual to contemplate his own personal responses?... his innermost feelings.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe national memorial has three main parts: entry, assembly room, and shrine. The central assembly room features seven large open windows on either wall and ceiling, to commemorate the date of the attack. Rumor says the 21 windows symbolically represents a 21-gun salute or 21?Marines standing at eternal parade rest over the tomb of the fallen, but guides at the site will confirm this was not the architect's intention. The memorial also has an opening in the floor overlooking the sunken decks. It is from this opening that visitors can pay their respects by tossing flowers in honor of the fallen sailors. In the past, leis were tossed in the water, but because string from leis poses a hazard to sea life, leis now are placed on guardrails in front of the names of the fallen.\\r\\nOne of the three 19,585-pound (8,884?kg) anchors of the Arizona is displayed at the visitor center's entrance. (One of the other two is at the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix.) One of the two ship's bells is in the visitor center. (Its twin is in the clock tower of the Student Memorial Center at the University of Arizona in Tucson.)\\r\\nThe shrine at the far end is a marble wall that bears the names of all those killed on the Arizona, protected behind velvet ropes. To the left of the main wall is a small plaque which bears the names of thirty or so crew members who survived the 1941 sinking. Any surviving crew members of the Arizona (or their families on their behalf) can have their ashes interred within the wreck, by U.S. Navy divers [13]\\r\\nThe USS Arizona Memorial was formally dedicated on May 30, 1962 (Memorial Day) by Texas Congressman and Chairman of Veteran Affairs Olin E. Teague and Governor John A. Burns.\\r\\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. While the wreck of USS Arizona was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989, the memorial does not share this status. Rather, it is listed separately from the wreck on the National Register of Historic Places. The joint administration of the memorial by the United States Navy and the National Park Service was established on September 9, 1980.\\r\\nOil leaking from the sunken battleship can still be seen rising from the wreckage to the water's surface. This oil is sometimes referred to as \\"the tears of the Arizona\\"[14][15] or \\"black tears.\\"[16] In a National Geographic feature published in 2001, concerns were expressed that the continued deterioration of the Arizona's bulkheads and oil tanks from saltwater corrosion could pose a significant environmental threat from a rupture, resulting in a significant release of oil.[17] The National Park Service states it has an ongoing program that closely monitors the submerged vessel's condition.\\r\\nThe Park Service, as part of its Centennial Initiative celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2016, is developing a \\"mobile park\\" to tour the continental United States to increase exposure of the park. The mobile park will also collect oral histories of the attack on Pearl Harbor.[18]\\r\\nUpon the deck of the battleship USS?Missouri in Tokyo Bay, the Japanese surrendered to United States General Douglas MacArthur and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, ending World War?II. In 1999, Missouri was moved to Pearl Harbor from the United States west coast and docked behind, and in line, with the USS Arizona, placing it perpendicular to the USS Arizona Memorial. The pairing of the two ships became an evocative symbol of the beginning and end of the United States' participation in the war.\\r\\nUSS Arizona Memorial staff initially criticized the placement of the Missouri, saying the large battleship would \\"overshadow\\" the Arizona Memorial. To guard against this perception, Missouri was placed well back of the Arizona Memorial, and positioned in Pearl Harbor to prevent those participating in military ceremonies on Missouri's aft decks from seeing the Arizona Memorial. The decision to have Missouri's bow face the Memorial was intended to convey that the Missouri now watches over the remains of the Arizona so that those interred within the Arizona's hull may rest in peace. These measures have helped preserve the identities of the Arizona Memorial and the Missouri Memorial, thereby improving the public's perception of having Arizona and Missouri in the same harbor.[19]\\r\\nThe Visitor Center operated by the National Park Service is free to the public and has a museum with exhibits about the Pearl Harbor attack, such as the ship's bell from the Arizona.\\r\\nAccess to the USS Arizona Memorial is by U.S. Navy boat, for which a numbered ticket, obtained at the Visitor Center and valid for a designated departure time, is required. More than one million people visit the memorial each year.[1] Because of the large number of visitors and the limited number of boat departures, the 4,500 tickets available each day are often fully allocated by mid-morning.[20] Before boarding the boat for the short trip to the Memorial, visitors view a 23-minute documentary film depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor. Touring of the Memorial is self-guided. The National Park Service Web site provides visitor information, including hours of operation and ticketing advisories.\\r\\nA one-hour audio tour of the Memorial and Center exhibits, narrated by actress Jamie Lee Curtis, whose father, Tony Curtis was a World War II and Navy veteran, is available for rent at the Visitor Center. On the Center's grounds along the shoreline are more exhibits and a \\"Remembrance Circle\\". Nearby is USS Bowfin, a World War II Diesel submarine, which may be toured with separate, paid admission. The battleship USS Missouri and the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor may also be visited, but require a bus ride to Ford Island.\\r\\nEvery United States Navy, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine vessel entering Pearl Harbor participates in the tradition of \\"manning the rails.\\" Personnel serving on these ships stand at attention at the ship's guard rails and salute the USS Arizona Memorial in solemn fashion as their ship slowly glides into port.\\r\\nThe Arizona is no longer in commission, but is an active U.S. military cemetery. As survivors of the attack on the Arizona pass away, many choose either to have their ashes scattered in the water over the ship, or to have their urns placed within the well of the barbette of Turret No. 4.[21] As a special tribute to the ship and her lost crew, the United States flag flies from the flagpole, which is attached to the severed mainmast of the sunken battleship.[22] The Arizona memorial is one of the nine major historical sites incorporated into the wide-ranging World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument, established by Congress in 2008 and dedicated on December 7, 2010.[10]\\r\\nSince it was formally dedicated in 1962, every U.S. President has made a pilgrimage to the memorial, presenting a wreath and scattering flowers over the Arizona in honor of the Americans who perished there.[23] On 27 December, 2016, Japanese Prime Minister Shinz Abe visited the memorial with President Barack Obama and paid respects to fallen service members there. Abe is the first Prime Minister of Japan to visit the USS Arizona memorial, 75 years after the Japanese attack. The visit was hailed by President Obama as \\"a historic gesture of reconciliation.\\"[24]","field3":"On which island is the uss arizona memorial?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"the Pacific Ocean","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Cabo San Lucas (Spanish pronunciation:?[?kao san ?lukas], Cape Saint Luke), commonly called Cabo in American English, is a city at the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur. Cabo San Lucas together with San Jos del Cabo is known as Los Cabos.\\r\\nCabo has been rated as one of Mexico's top 5 tourist destinations;[4] it is known for its beaches, scuba diving locations, balnearios, the sea arch El Arco de Cabo San Lucas, and marine life. The Los Cabos Corridor has become a heavily trafficked holiday destination for tourists, with numerous resorts and timeshares along the coast between Cabo San Lucas and San Jos del Cabo.\\r\\nCabo houses a range of wildlife, including rays, sharks, birds, and a range of fish, such as mahi-mahi (dorado), and striped marlin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaeological excavations have shown evidence of continual human habitation in the area for at least 10,000 years.[5] When the first Europeans arrived, they encountered the Peric~ people, who survived on a subsistence diet based on hunting and gathering seeds, roots, shellfish, and other marine resources. They called the location Yenecam~.\\r\\nAccording to the narrative of Hatsutaro, a Japanese castaway, in the book Kaigai Ibun (written by Maekawa, Junzo and Bunzo Sakai and narrated by Hatsutaro), when he arrived at Cabo San Lucas in May 1842, there were only two houses and about 20 inhabitants. However, American authors such as Henry Edwards and John Ross Browne claim that Cabo San Lucas's founder was an Englishman named Thomas \\"Old Tom\\" Ritchie. John Ross Browne says Ritchie arrived there about 1828, while Edwards says that he died in October 1874.[6]\\r\\nA fishing village began growing in the area. In 1917, an American company built a floating platform to catch tuna, and ten years later founded Compa?a de Productos Marinos S.A. The plant operated for several years.[citation needed]\\r\\nCabo San Lucas has become a prominent vacation and spa destination, with a variety of sites of interest and timeshares that have been built on the coast between San Lucas and San Jos del Cabo. The distinctive Arco de Cabo San Lucas is a local landmark.\\r\\nCabo San Lucas has the highest paying marlin tournament in the world called the \\"Bisbee's Los Cabos Offshore\\". This tournament takes place every year in the month of October.[7]\\r\\nIn the winter, pods of whales can be observed in the area. They bear their calves in the warm waters of the Gulf of California after completing their 6000-mile migration from Alaska and Siberia.\\r\\nThe beaches, surfing, and sport fishing opportunities in Cabo San Lucas have attracted a great number of Mexican natives and foreigners to spend their vacations in large-scale tourist developments there. The development of Cabo's tourism industry was prompted by the Mexican government's development of infrastructure to turn Cabo San Lucas into a major center for tourism in Mexico, beginning in 1974. Upon completion of the Transpeninsular Highway, also known as the Mexican Federal Highway 1, tourist developments in Los Cabos proceeded relatively unchecked.\\r\\nUntil fairly recently,[when?] the unique and fragile environment of this part of Mexico was largely unprotected by law, and therefore was subjected to developers acting in concert with government agencies interested only in low-end tourist bonanzas. There is, however, a growing collection of activists and attorneys now involved in preserving many of Baja's desert habitats, marine mammals, and stretches of coastline. A number of agencies including the Gulf of California Conservation Fund[8] and the Center for Environmental Law in La Paz[9] are challenging the destruction of wetlands and other ecosystems from Los Cabos to Ensenada. In the face of a growing international public demand for corporate-driven ecological stewardship, higher-end resorts in the Los Cabos area are increasingly sensitive to their environmental impact, and are taking initial steps to institute sustainable practices such as reducing water usage and non-recyclable trash output.[10] In 2017 Los Cabos is projected to be one of the leaders in travel in Latin America, many of the developments owed to its increased accessibility with added plane routes from the US and Canada. It is expected that by 2018 4,000 new sleeping rooms will come online in Cabo, and the increase in tourism will contribute to its growth as a leader in leisure.[11]\\r\\nCabo San Lucas and San Jos del Cabo are served by Los Cabos International Airport.\\r\\nThe town is also a popular port of call for many cruise ships. Cabo San Lucas has a small international airfield, which handles air traffic for general aviation flights and air taxi service.\\r\\nMany tourists get around the area through the numerous local taxis that service the primary parts of Cabo, as well as the Corridor and the airport. Alternatively, there is a system of small buses that are used by locals but also available to tourists, and costing a few pesos tend to be much less expensive than the taxis. [12]\\r\\nClubs in Cabo include the Cabo Wabo Cantina, the Baja Brewing Company (also the first microbrewery in Baja California), Pink Kitty Nightclub, Mandala, El Squid Roe, Giggling Marlin, Nowhere Bar, Tiki Bar, the Usual Suspects and the Jungle Bar. Restaurants in downtown Cabo include Edith's, Hacienda Cocina y Cantina, and Sunset da Mona Lisa. Tourists can also ride horses through the desert, charter a boat for fishing, snorkel, and parasail on the beach. The English-language newspaper for Cabo San Lucas, the biweekly \\"Gringo Gazette\\", has news on tourist activities in Cabo San Lucas, San Jose, Todos Santos, La Paz, and the East Cape Baja.[13]\\r\\nThe corridor is home to a variety of hotels and tourist attractions. High-end resorts in the corridor include the One&Only Palmilla, Esperanza, The Resort at Pedregal, and Las Ventanas al Paraiso.\\r\\nMedano Beach, located in the Chileno Bay, is one of the most frequented beaches in the Corridor. It is home to tropical fish, sea turtles, invertebrates, and sponges. Snorkelers often visit Chileno Bay to observe the underwater sea life.\\r\\nCabo San Lucas has a BWh desert climate.\\r\\nDuring summer, Cabo San Lucas is cooler than San Jos del Cabo by about by about 1.5 to 3 C (3 to 5 F). Sometimes during the summer, when winds blow from the Pacific Ocean instead of the Gulf of California, the differences in temperatures between San Jos del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas are higher.\\r\\nCabo San Lucas is less rainy than San Jos del Cabo, although hurricanes can bring heavy rain for long periods. Hurricane Odile made landfall at Cabo San Lucas on 14 September 2014, and caused widespread damage.[14] Due to the position of the city and orography, local summer thunderstorms do not get near enough to bring rain to the town.\\r\\nThe sea temperature experiences lows of 21ÿ22?C (70ÿ72?F) in winter, and highs of 28ÿ29?C (82ÿ84?F) during the summer months.[15]\\r\\n72.4?F\\r\\n70.7?F\\r\\n70.6?F\\r\\n70.7?F\\r\\n74.3?F\\r\\n73.5?F\\r\\n78.2?F\\r\\n83.2?F\\r\\n85?F\\r\\n84.1?F\\r\\n80.2?F\\r\\n75.3?F\\r\\nAs of the 2010 Censo General de Poblaci܇n y Vivienda, the population was 68,463 and has experienced very rapid growth and development.[3] It is the third-largest city in Baja California Sur after La Paz and San Jos del Cabo (although it is only slightly less populous than San Jos del Cabo).\\r\\nThe majority of non-Mexican inhabitants in the community originate from the United States, and along with residents from San Jos del Cabo they account for the 80% of the U.S. population in the state.[19]","field3":"What bodies of water surround cabo san lucas?"},{"The Trumpeting Place inscription":"the Dissolution of the Monasteries","a stone (2.43?G?1 m) with Hebrew inscription \\"\\"To the Trumpeting Place\\"\\" excavated by Benjamin Mazar at the southern foot of the Temple Mount is believed to be a part of the Second Temple.":"Old English literature or Anglo-Saxon literature, encompasses literature written in Old English, in Anglo-Saxon England from the 7th century to the decades after the Norman Conquest of 1066. \\"C?dmon's Hymn\\", composed in the 7th century, according to Bede, is often considered the oldest extant poem in English, whereas the later poem, The Grave is one of the final poems written in Old English, and presents a transitional text between Old and Middle English.[1] The Peterborough Chronicle can also be considered a late-period text, continuing into the 12th century.\\r\\nThe poem Beowulf, which often begins the traditional canon of English literature, is the most famous work of Old English literature. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has also proven significant for historical study, preserving a chronology of early English history.\\r\\nIn descending order of quantity, Old English literature consists of: sermons and saints' lives; biblical translations; translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers; Anglo-Saxon chronicles and narrative history works; laws, wills and other legal works; practical works on grammar, medicine, geography; and poetry.[2] In all there are over 400 surviving manuscripts from the period, of which about 189 are considered \\"major\\".[3]\\r\\nBesides Old English literature, Anglo-Saxons wrote a number of Anglo-Latin works.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOld English literature has gone through different periods of research; in the 19th and early 20th centuries the focus was on the Germanic and pagan roots that scholars thought they could detect in Old English literature.[4] Later, on account of the work of Bernard F. Hupp,[5] the influence of Augustinian exegesis was emphasised.[6] Today, along with a focus upon paleography and the physical manuscripts themselves more generally, scholars debate such issues as dating, place of origin, authorship, and the connections between Anglo-Saxon culture and the rest of Europe in the Middle Ages, and literary merits.\\r\\nA large number of manuscripts remain from the Anglo-Saxon period, with most written during its last 300?years (9th to 11th centuries).\\r\\nManuscripts written in both Latin and the vernacular remain. It is believed that Irish missionaries are responsible for the scripts used in early Anglo-Saxon texts, which include the Insular half-uncial (important latin texts) and Insular minuscule (both latin and the vernacular). In the 10th century, the Caroline minuscule was adopted for Latin, however the Insular minuscule continued to be used for Old English texts. Thereafter, it was increasingly influenced by Caroline minuscule, while retaining certain distinctively Insular letter-forms.[7]\\r\\nThere were considerable losses of manuscripts as a result of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century.[2] Scholarly study of the language began when the manuscripts were collected by scholars and antiquarians such as Matthew Parker, Laurence Nowell and Sir Robert Bruce Cotton.[8]\\r\\nOld English manuscripts have been highly prized by collectors since the 16th century, both for their historic value and for their aesthetic beauty with their uniformly spaced letters and decorative elements.[2]\\r\\nThere are four major poetic manuscripts:\\r\\nSeven major scriptoria produced a good deal of Old English manuscripts: Winchester; Exeter; Worcester; Abingdon; Durham; and two Canterbury houses, Christ Church and St. Augustine's Abbey.[10] In addition, some Old English text survives on stone structures and other ornate objects.[2]\\r\\nRegional dialects include: Northumbrian; Mercian; Kentish; and West Saxon.[10] The majority of extant texts are written in West Saxon; however, spelling and vocabulary often reflects more typically a Mercian or Northumbrian dialect, leading to the speculation that much of the poetry may have been translated into West Saxon at a later date.[11] An example of the dominance of the West Saxon dialect is a pair of charters, from the Stowe and British Museum collections, which outline grants of land in Kent and Mercia, but are nonetheless written in the West Saxon dialect of the period. [12]\\r\\nEarly English manuscripts often contain later annotations in the margins of the texts; it is a rarity to find a completely unannotated manuscript. These include corrections, alterations and expansions of the main text, as well as commentary upon it, and even unrelated texts.[13][14] The majority of these annotations appear to date to the 13th century and later.[15]\\r\\nOld English poetry falls broadly into two styles or fields of reference, the heroic Germanic and the Christian. Almost all Old English poets are anonymous.\\r\\nAlthough there are Anglo-Saxon discourses on Latin prosody, the rules of Old English verse are understood only through modern analysis of the extant texts. The first widely accepted theory was constructed by Eduard Sievers (1893), who distinguished five distinct alliterative patterns.[16] His system of alliterative verse is based on accent, alliteration, the quantity of vowels, and patterns of syllabic accentuation. It consists of five permutations on a base verse scheme; any one of the five types can be used in any verse. The system was inherited from and exists in one form or another in all of the older Germanic languages. Two poetic figures commonly found in Old English poetry are the kenning, an often formulaic phrase that describes one thing in terms of another (e.g. in Beowulf, the sea is called the whale road) and litotes, a dramatic understatement employed by the author for ironic effect.[16] Alternative theories have been proposed, such as the theory of John C. Pope (1942), which uses musical notation to track the verse patterns.[17] J. R. R. Tolkien describes and illustrates many of the features of Old English poetry in his 1940 essay \\"On Translating Beowulf\\".[18]\\r\\nEven though all extant Old English poetry is written and literate, it is assumed that Old English poetry was an oral craft that was performed by a scop and accompanied by a harp.\\r\\nMost Old English poems are recorded without authors, and very few names are known with any certainty; the primary three are C?dmon, Aldhelm, and Cynewulf.[19]\\r\\nC?dmon is considered the first Old English poet whose work still survives. According to the account in Bede's Historia ecclesiastica, he was first a herdsman before living as a monk at the abbey of Whitby in Northumbria in the 7th century.[19][20] Only his first poem, comprising nine-lines, C?dmon's Hymn, remains, in Northumbrian, West-Saxon and Latin versions that appear in 19 surviving manuscripts:[21]\\r\\nCynewulf has proven to be a difficult figure to identify, but recent research suggests he was an Anglian poet from the early part of the 9th century. Four poems are attributed to him, signed with a runic acrostic at the end of each poem; these are The Fates of the Apostles and Elene (both found in the Vercelli Book), and Christ II and Juliana (both found in the Exeter Book).[24]\\r\\nAlthough William of Malmesbury claims that Aldhelm, bishop of Sherborne (d. 709), performed secular songs while accompanied by a harp, none of these Old English poems survives.[24] Paul G. Remely has recently proposed that the Old English Exodus may have been the work of Aldhelm, or someone closely associated with him.[25]\\r\\nBede is often thought to be the poet of a five-line poem entitled Bede's Death Song, on account of its appearance in a letter on his death by Cuthbert. This poem exists in a Northumbrian and later version.[26]\\r\\nAlfred is said to be the author of some of the metrical prefaces to the Old English translations of Gregory's Pastoral Care and Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy. Alfred is also thought to be the author of 50 metrical psalms, but whether the poems were written by him, under his direction or patronage, or as a general part in his reform efforts is unknown.[27]\\r\\nThe hypotheses of Milman Parry and Albert Lord on the Homeric Question came to be applied (by Parry and Lord, but also by Francis Magoun) to verse written in Old English. That is, the theory proposes that certain features of at least some of the poetry may be explained by positing oral-formulaic composition. While Anglo-Saxon (Old English) epic poetry may bear some resemblance to Ancient Greek epics such as the Iliad and Odyssey, the question of if and how Anglo-Saxon poetry was passed down through an oral tradition remains a subject of debate, and the question for any particular poem unlikely to be answered with perfect certainty.\\r\\nParry and Lord had already demonstrated the density of metrical formulas in Ancient Greek, and observed that the same phenomenon was apparent in the Old English alliterative line:\\r\\nIn addition to verbal formulas, many themes have been shown to appear among the various works of Anglo-Saxon literature. The theory proposes to explain this fact by suggesting that the poetry was composed of formulae and themes from a stock common to the poetic profession, as well as literary passages composed by individual artists in a more modern sense. Larry Benson introduced the concept of \\"written-formulaic\\" to describe the status of some Anglo-Saxon poetry which, while demonstrably written, contains evidence of oral influences, including heavy reliance on formulas and themes.[28] Frequent oral-formulaic themes in Old English poetry include \\"Beasts of Battle\\"[29] and the \\"Cliff of Death\\".[30] The former, for example, is characterised by the mention of ravens, eagles, and wolves preceding particularly violent depictions of battle. Among the most thoroughly documented themes is \\"The Hero on the Beach\\". D. K. Crowne[31] first proposed this theme, defined by four characteristics:\\r\\nOne example Crowne cites in his article is that which concludes Beowulf's fight with the monsters during his swimming match with Breca:\\r\\nCrowne drew on examples of the theme's appearance in twelve Anglo-Saxon texts, including one occurrence in Beowulf. It was also observed in other works of Germanic origin, Middle English poetry, and even an Icelandic prose saga. John Richardson held that the schema was so general as to apply to virtually any character at some point in the narrative, and thought it an instance of the \\"threshold\\" feature of Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey monomyth. J.A. Dane, in an article[32] (characterised by Foley as \\"polemics without rigour\\"[33]) claimed that the appearance of the theme in Ancient Greek poetry, a tradition without known connection to the Germanic, invalidated the notion of \\"an autonomous theme in the baggage of an oral poet.\\" Foley's response was that Dane misunderstood the nature of oral tradition, and that in fact the appearance of the theme in other cultures showed that it was a traditional form.[34]\\r\\nThe Old English poetry which has received the most attention deals with the Germanic heroic past. The longest at 3,182 lines, and the most important, is Beowulf, which appears in the damaged Nowell Codex. Beowulf relates the exploits of the hero Beowulf, King of the Weder-Geats or Angles, around the middle of the 5th century. The author is unknown, and no mention of Britain occurs. Scholars are divided over the date of the present text, with hypotheses ranging from the 8th to the 11th centuries.[35][36] It has achieved much acclaim as well as sustained academic and artistic interest.[citation needed]\\r\\nOther heroic poems besides Beowulf exist. Two have survived in fragments: The Fight at Finnsburh, controversially interpreted by many to be a retelling of one of the battle scenes in Beowulf, and Waldere, a version of the events of the life of Walter of Aquitaine. Two other poems mention heroic figures: Widsith is believed to be very old in parts, dating back to events in the 4th century concerning Eormanric and the Goths, and contains a catalogue of names and places associated with valiant deeds. Deor is a lyric, in the style of Consolation of Philosophy, applying examples of famous heroes, including Weland and Eormanric, to the narrator's own case.[24]\\r\\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle contains various heroic poems inserted throughout. The earliest from 937 is called The Battle of Brunanburh, which celebrates the victory of King Athelstan over the Scots and Norse. There are five shorter poems: capture of the Five Boroughs (942); coronation of King Edgar (973); death of King Edgar (975); death of Alfred the son of King ?thelred (1036); and death of King Edward the Confessor (1065).[24]\\r\\nThe 325 line poem The Battle of Maldon celebrates Earl Byrhtnoth and his men who fell in battle against the Vikings in 991. It is considered one of the finest, but both the beginning and end are missing and the only manuscript was destroyed in a fire in 1731.[37] A well-known speech is near the end of the poem:\\r\\nOld English heroic poetry was handed down orally from generation to generation. As Christianity began to appear, re-tellers often recast the tales of Christianity into the older heroic stories.\\r\\nRelated to the heroic tales are a number of short poems from the Exeter Book which have come to be described as \\"elegies\\"[39] or \\"wisdom poetry\\".[40][41] They are lyrical and Boethian in their description of the up and down fortunes of life. Gloomy in mood is The Ruin, which tells of the decay of a once glorious city of Roman Britain (cities in Britain fell into decline after the Romans departed in the early 5th century, as the early English continued to live their rural life), and The Wanderer, in which an older man talks about an attack that happened in his youth, where his close friends and kin were all killed; memories of the slaughter have remained with him all his life. He questions the wisdom of the impetuous decision to engage a possibly superior fighting force: the wise man engages in warfare to preserve civil society, and must not rush into battle but seek out allies when the odds may be against him. This poet finds little glory in bravery for bravery's sake. The Seafarer is the story of a somber exile from home on the sea, from which the only hope of redemption is the joy of heaven. Other wisdom poems include Wulf and Eadwacer, The Wife's Lament, and The Husband's Message. Alfred the Great wrote a wisdom poem over the course of his reign based loosely on the neoplatonic philosophy of Boethius called the Lays of Boethius.[42]\\r\\nSeveral Old English poems are adaptations of late classical philosophical texts. The longest is a 10th-century translation of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy contained in the Cotton manuscript Otho A.vi.[43] Another is The Phoenix in the Exeter Book, an allegorisation of the De ave phoenice by Lactantius.[44]\\r\\nOther short poems derive from the Latin bestiary tradition. Some examples include The Panther, The Whale and The Partridge.[44]\\r\\nAnglo-Saxon riddles are part of Anglo-Saxon literature. The most famous Anglo-Saxon riddles are found in the Exeter Book. This book contains secular and religious poems and other writings, along with a collection of 94 riddles, although there is speculation that there may have been closer to 100 riddles in the book. The riddles are written in a similar manner, but \\"it is unlikely that the whole collection was written by one person.\\"[45] It is more likely that many scribes worked on this collection of riddles. Although the Exeter Book has a unique and extensive collection of Anglo-Saxon riddles,[46] riddles were not uncommon during this era. Riddles were both comical and obscene.[45]\\r\\nThe Vercelli Book and Exeter Book contain four long narrative poems of saints' lives, or hagiography. In Vercelli are Andreas and Elene and in Exeter are Guthlac and Juliana.\\r\\nAndreas is 1,722 lines long and is the closest of the surviving Old English poems to Beowulf in style and tone. It is the story of Saint Andrew and his journey to rescue Saint Matthew from the Mermedonians. Elene is the story of Saint Helena (mother of Constantine) and her discovery of the True Cross. The cult of the True Cross was popular in Anglo-Saxon England and this poem was instrumental.[47]\\r\\nGuthlac consists of two poems about the English 7th century Saint Guthlac. Juliana describes the life of Saint Juliana, including a discussion with the devil during her imprisonment.[47]\\r\\nThere are a number of partial Old English Bible translations and paraphrases surviving. The Junius manuscript contains three paraphrases of Old Testament texts. These were re-wordings of Biblical passages in Old English, not exact translations, but paraphrasing, sometimes into beautiful poetry in its own right. The first and longest is of Genesis (originally presented as one work in the Junius manuscript but now thought to consist of two separate poems, A and B), the second is of Exodus and the third is Daniel. Contained in Daniel are two lyrics, Song of the Three Children and Song of Azarias, the latter also appearing in the Exeter Book after Guthlac.[48] The fourth and last poem, Christ and Satan, which is contained in the second part of the Junius manuscript, does not paraphrase any particular biblical book, but retells a number of episodes from both the Old and New Testament.[49]\\r\\nThe Nowell Codex contains a Biblical poetic paraphrase, which appears right after Beowulf, called Judith, a retelling of the story of Judith. This is not to be confused with ?lfric's homily Judith, which retells the same Biblical story in alliterative prose.[44]\\r\\nOld English translations of Psalms 51-150 have been preserved, following a prose version of the first 50 Psalms.[44] There are verse translations of the Gloria in Excelsis, the Lord's Prayer, and the Apostles' Creed, as well as some hymns and proverbs.[42]\\r\\nIn addition to Biblical paraphrases are a number of original religious poems, mostly lyrical (non-narrative).[44]\\r\\nThe Exeter Book contains a series of poems entitled Christ, sectioned into Christ I, Christ II and Christ III.[44]\\r\\nConsidered one of the most beautiful of all Old English poems is Dream of the Rood, contained in the Vercelli Book.[44] The presence of a portion of the poem (in Northumbrian dialect[50]) carved in ruins on an 8th century stone cross found in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire, verifies the age of at least this portion of the poem. The Dream of the Rood is a dream vision in which the personified cross tells the story of the crucifixion. Christ appears as a young hero-king, confidant of victory, while the cross itself feels all the physical pain of the crucifixion, as well as the pain of being forced to kill the young lord.[51]\\r\\nThe dreamer resolves to trust in the cross, and the dream ends with a vision of heaven.\\r\\nThere are a number of religious debate poems. The longest is Christ and Satan in the Junius manuscript, it deals with the conflict between Christ and Satan during the forty days in the desert. Another debate poem is Solomon and Saturn, surviving in a number of textual fragments, Saturn is portrayed as a magician debating with the wise king Solomon.[44]\\r\\nOther poetic forms exist in Old English including short verses, gnomes, and mnemonic poems for remembering long lists of names.[42]\\r\\nThere are short verses found in the margins of manuscripts which offer practical advice, such as remedies against the loss of cattle or how to deal with a delayed birth, often grouped as charms. The longest is called Nine Herbs Charm and is probably of pagan origin. Other similar short verses, or charms, include For a Swarm of Bees, Against a Dwarf, Against a Stabbing Pain, and Against a Wen.[42]\\r\\nThere are a group of mnemonic poems designed to help memorise lists and sequences of names and to keep objects in order. These poems are named Menologium, The Fates of the Apostles, The Rune Poem, The Seasons for Fasting, and the Instructions for Christians.[42]\\r\\nAnglo-Saxon poetry is marked by the comparative rarity of similes. This is a particular feature of Anglo-Saxon verse style, and is a consequence both of its structure and of the rapidity with which images are deployed, to be unable to effectively support the expanded simile. As an example of this, Beowulf contains at best five similes, and these are of the short variety. This can be contrasted sharply with the strong and extensive dependence that Anglo-Saxon poetry has upon metaphor, particularly that afforded by the use of kennings. The most prominent example of this in The Wanderer is the reference to battle as a \\"storm of spears\\".[53] This reference to battle shows how Anglo-Saxons viewed battle: as unpredictable, chaotic, violent, and perhaps even a function of nature.\\r\\nOld English poetry traditionally alliterates, meaning that a sound (usually the initial consonant sound) is repeated throughout a line. For instance, in the first line of Beowulf, \\"Hwaet! We Gar-Dena | in gear-dagum\\",[54] (meaning \\"Lo! We ... of the Spear Danes in days of yore\\"), the stressed words Gar-Dena and gear-dagum alliterate on the consonant \\"G\\".","field3":""}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function P(h,t,n,c,u,o){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),i(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),i(l,null,g(o.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const x=d(M,[["render",P]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/21.md","filePath":"qapage/21.md"}'),R={name:"qapage/21.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[b(x)]))}});export{W as __pageData,G as default};
