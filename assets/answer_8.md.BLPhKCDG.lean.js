His theories parallel many other theories of human developmental psychology , some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. He then decided to create a classification system which reflected the universal needs of society as its base and then proceeding to more acquired emotions . Maslow 's hierarchy of needs is used to study how humans partake in behavioral motivation intrinsically . Maslow used the terms \`\` physiological , '' \`\` safety , '' \`\` belonging and love , '' \`\` esteem , '' and \`\` self - actualization '' to describe the pattern through which human motivations generally move . This means that in order for motivation to occur at the next level , each level must be satisfied within the individual themselves . Furthermore , this theory is a key foundation in understanding how drive and motivation are correlated when discussing human behavior . Each of these individual levels contains a certain amount of internal sensation that must be met in order for an individual to complete their hierarchy.

In both cases , the development of the concept is cited as a main motivation behind the prize . It represents the hypothetical unemployment rate consistent with aggregate production being at the \`\` long - run '' level . This level is consistent with aggregate production in the absence of various temporary frictions such as incomplete price adjustment in labor and goods markets . The natural rate of unemployment therefore corresponds to the unemployment rate prevailing under a classical view of determination of activity . It is mainly determined by the economy 's supply side , and hence production possibilities and economic institutions . If these institutional features involve permanent mismatches in the labor market or real wage rigidities , the natural rate of unemployment may feature involuntary unemployment . The natural rate of unemployment is a combination of frictional and structural unemployment that persists in an efficient , expanding economy when labor and resource markets are in equilibrium ."},{"query":"what are the two types of endoplasmic reticulum mention one function of each","short_answer":"","abstract":"The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is a type of organelle found in eukaryotic cells that forms an interconnected network of flattened , membrane - enclosed sacs or tube - like structures known as cisternae .

The opposite of an inhibitory postsynaptic potential is an excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) , which is a synaptic potential that makes a postsynaptic neuron more likely to generate an action potential . IPSPs can take place at all chemical synapses , which use the secretion of neurotransmitters to create cell to cell signalling . Inhibitory presynaptic neurons release neurotransmitters that then bind to the postsynaptic receptors ; this induces a change in the permeability of the postsynaptic neuronal membrane to particular ions . An electric current that changes the postsynaptic membrane potential to create a more negative postsynaptic potential is generated , i.e. the postsynaptic membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting membrane potential , and this is called hyperpolarisation . In order for an action potential to be generated , depolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane needs to occur , where the membrane potential becomes more positive than resting membrane potential . Therefore , hyperpolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane makes it less likely for depolarisation to sufficiently occur to generate an action potential in the postsynaptic neurone ."},{"query":"who are the top most subscribed on youtube","short_answer":"","abstract":"This article lists the fifty most - subscribed channels on the video platform YouTube .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the \`\` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the façade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power princeps senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the princeps . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire ."},{"query":"what's the chronological order of star wars","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"endangered species of pakistan as per iucn red list","short_answer":"","abstract":"Ministry of Environment ( Pakistan ) Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency Dhodial Pheasantry Zoological Survey Department of Pakistan Sindh Wildlife Department Punjab Wildlife Department Khyber Pakhtukhwa Wildlife Department Baluchistan Wildlife Department Gilgit Baltistan Wildlife Department Himalayan Wildlife Foundation National Institute of Oceanography ( Pakistan )"},{"query":"which country in asia has the largest population","short_answer":"China","abstract":"This is a list of Asian countries and dependent territories by population , which normalized demographic projections ."},{"query":"what was one long term effect of the work of the civilian conservation corps","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) was a public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed , unmarried men from relief families as part of the New Deal .

In the 7th century its population increased greatly , prospering under Assyrian vassalage ( despite Hezekiah 's revolt against the Assyrian king Sennacherib ) , but in 605 the Assyrian Empire was defeated , and the ensuing competition between the Twenty - sixth Dynasty of Egypt and the Neo-Babylonian Empire for control of the Eastern Mediterranean led to the destruction of the kingdom in a series of campaigns between 597 and 582 , the deportation of the elite of the community , and the incorporation of Judah into a province of the Neo-Babylonian Empire ."},{"query":"where can the great sphinx of giza be found","short_answer":"on the Giza Plateau on the west bank of the Nile in Giza , Egypt","abstract":"The Great Sphinx of Giza ( Arabic : أبو الهول ‎ , translit . ʼabu alhōl / ʼabu alhawl , IPA : ( ʔabu alhoːl ) , English : The Terrifying One ; literally : Father of Dread ) , commonly referred to as the Sphinx of Giza or just the Sphinx , is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx , a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head of a human .

Most of them are combining forms in New Latin and hence international scientific vocabulary . There are a few general rules about how they combine . First , prefixes and suffixes , most of which are derived from ancient Greek or classical Latin , have a droppable - o - . As a general rule , this - o - almost always acts as a joint - stem to connect two consonantal roots , e.g. arthr - + - o - + logy = arthrology . But generally , the - o - is dropped when connecting to a vowel - stem ; e.g. arthr - + itis = arthritis , instead of * arthr - o-itis . Second , medical roots generally go together according to language , i.e. , Greek prefixes occur with Greek suffixes and Latin prefixes with Latin suffixes . Although international scientific vocabulary is not stringent about segregating combining forms of different languages , it is advisable when coining new words not to mix different lingual roots ."},{"query":"hulk hogan vs andre the giant shea stadium","short_answer":"","abstract":"Showdown at Shea was the name given to three professional wrestling events presented by the World Wide Wrestling Federation at Flushing , New York 's Shea Stadium .

A requirement of EF Codd in his seminal paper is that a primary key of an entity , or any part of it , can never take a null value . The relational model states that every relation ( or table ) must have an identifier , called the primary key ( abbreviated PK ) , in such a way that every row of the same relation be identifiable by its content , that is , by a unique and minimal value . The PK is a not empty set of attributes ( or columns ) . The same format applies to the foreign key ( abbreviated FK ) because each FK matches a preexistent PK .

When factor analysis ( a statistical technique ) is applied to personality survey data , some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person . For example , someone described as \`\` conscientious '' is more likely to be described as \`\` always prepared '' rather than \`\` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , a number of correlated and more specific primary factors are claimed .

It is the product of the global air circulation cell known as the Hadley Cell . The subtropical ridge is characterized by mostly calm winds , which act to reduce air quality under its axis by causing fog overnight , and haze during daylight hours as a result of the stable atmosphere found near its location . The air descending from the upper troposphere flows out from its center at surface level toward the upper and lower latitudes of each hemisphere , creating both the trade winds and the westerlies . The subtropical ridge moves poleward during the summer , reaching its most northern latitude in early fall , before moving equatorward during the cold season . The El Niño southern climate oscillation ( ENSO ) can displace the northern hemisphere subtropical ridge , with La Niñas allowing for a more northerly axis for the ridge , while El Niños show flatter , more southerly ridges . The change of the ridge position during ENSO cycles changes the tracks of tropical cyclones that form around their equatorward and western peripheries .

Maslow subsequently extended the idea to include his observations of humans ' innate curiosity . His theories parallel many other theories of human developmental psychology , some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. He then decided to create a classification system which reflected the universal needs of society as its base and then proceeding to more acquired emotions . Maslow 's hierarchy of needs is used to study how humans partake in behavioral motivation intrinsically . Maslow used the terms \`\` physiological , '' \`\` safety , '' \`\` belonging and love , '' \`\` esteem , '' and \`\` self - actualization '' to describe the pattern through which human motivations generally move . This means that in order for motivation to occur at the next level , each level must be satisfied within the individual themselves . Furthermore , this theory is a key foundation in understanding how drive and motivation are correlated when discussing human behavior . Each of these individual levels contains a certain amount of internal sensation that must be met in order for an individual to complete their hierarchy.

The term Scotch - Irish is used primarily in the United States , with people in Great Britain or Ireland who are of a similar ancestry identifying as Ulster Scots people . Most of these emigres from Ireland had been recent settlers , or the descendants of settlers , from the Kingdom of England or the Kingdom of Scotland who had gone to Ireland to seek economic opportunities and freedom from the control of the episcopal Church of England and the Scottish Episcopal Church . These included 200,000 Scottish Presbyterians who settled in Ireland between 1608 - 1697 . Many English - born settlers of this period were also Presbyterians , although the denomination is today most strongly identified with Scotland . When King Charles I attempted to force these Presbyterians into the Church of England in the 1630s , many chose to re-emigrate to North America where religious liberty was greater . Later attempts to force the Church of England 's control over dissident Protestants in Ireland were to lead to further waves of emigration to the trans - Atlantic colonies ."},{"query":"how many rows of teeth to sharks have","short_answer":"the average shark having about 15 rows of teeth in each jaw","abstract":"A shark tooth is one of the numerous teeth of a shark .

By changing the airflow , this after - market add - on does claim to be a performance enhancing accessory that can increase an engine 's horse power , torque and fuel economy . It functions by swirling or directing the air flow to maximize air volume to the manifold . There is much debate about the veracity of the manufacturers claims for these devices . The general consensus is that it works well on some engine configurations , and not at all , or adversely on others . In 2009 the BBK Performance R&D Department performed extensive dyno testing of off the shelf throttle body spacers from other manufacturers . The intention was to determine whether or not throttle body spacers were a viable product that BBK could manufacture that would provide notable results for their customers . The tests were performed on Ford 4.6 L 3 - V , GM LS , and Mopar HEMI V8 applications using a Dynojet 248C dynamometer . The tests consisted of a baseline dyno run , cool down period , and a repeat test after the spacers were installed . None of the spacers produced any additional horsepower or torque when tested . The only notable change was a loss of 4 horsepower to the tires on the Mopar application with the spacer installed . An additional test was run after removing the spacer , resulting in a return of the lost horsepower . Proving that some spacers can actually rob power from an engine . After seeing the results , it was clear that throttle body spacers were simply gimmicks and provided no real performance value . BBK scrapped all plans to manufacture throttle body spacers ."},{"query":"who plays the blonde girl in harry potter","short_answer":"","abstract":"Evanna Patricia Lynch ( born 16 August 1991 ) is an Irish actress , model , and narrator .

Io has a similar mass and size as the Moon , but Io is the most geologically active body in the Solar System . This is caused by the heating mechanism of Io . The major heating source of Earth and its moon is radioactive heating , but the heating source on Io is tidal heating . As Jupiter is very massive , the side of Io nearest to Jupiter has a slightly larger gravitational pull than the opposite side . This difference in gravitational forces cause distortion of Io 's shape . Differently from the Earth 's only moon , Jupiter has several moons ( i.e. Io , Europa , Ganymede and Callisto ) . As Io is the innermost moon of Jupiter , Jupiter pulls Io inward and other moons pull Io outward . This causes Io 's orbit to be elliptical and eccentric . The distance between Jupiter and Io changes all the time and the distortion of Io likewise changes all the time . The constant change in the shape of Io results in a large amount of friction in the moon and the friction - induced heating drives strong volcanic activities on the surface of Io ."},{"query":"who sang it's the time of the season","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Time of the Season '' is a song by the British rock band the Zombies , featured on their 1968 album Odessey and Oracle .

Another name for food web is consumer - resource system . Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels : 1 ) the autotrophs , and 2 ) the heterotrophs . To maintain their bodies , grow , develop , and to reproduce , autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances , including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide . These chemical reactions require energy , which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis , although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs . A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere , to mixotrophs ( such as carnivorous plants ) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere , and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter . The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways , such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs . The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange . There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory , carnivory , scavenging and parasitism . Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs , such as sugars , provides energy . Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes , from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods , and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales ."},{"query":"who is serviced by the texas school for the blind","short_answer":"Students , ages 6 through 21 , who are blind , deafblind , or visually impaired , including those with additional disabilities","abstract":"The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired ( TSBVI ) is a Texas special public school , in the continuum of statewide placements for students who have a visual impairment .

The original accretion of the Earth 's material into a spherical mass is thought to have resulted in a relatively uniform composition . While residual heat from the collision of the material that formed the Earth was significant , heating from radioactive materials in this mass gradually increased the temperature until a critical condition was reached . As material became molten enough to allow movement , the denser iron and nickel , evenly distributed throughout the mass , began to migrate to the center of the planet to form the core . The gravitational potential energy released by the sinking of the dense NiFe globules , along with any cooler , denser solid material , is thought to have been a runaway process , increasing the temperature of the protoplanet above the melting point of most components , resulting in the rapid formation of a molten iron core covered by a deep global silicate magma .

The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from 20 long years of political and economic action . These had the common incentive of ending the growing communist domination in Vietnam . At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam . From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) . Eventually , U.S. missions were carried out at a more constant rate by sending out increasing number of military assistance from the United States . Their main intent was to restrict the Communist domination that was present in the government of Vietnam as it would soon lead to a chain of neighbouring countries adopting the same . This would have resulted in a change in balance of power throughout Southeast Asia . The U.S. foreign policy establishment saw national security interests being disturbed due to the rise of this communist expansion and strived to take any measure to end it .

More generally , the exogenous spending multiplier is the ratio of a change in national income to any autonomous change in spending ( private investment spending , consumer spending , government spending , or spending by foreigners on the country 's exports ) that causes it . When this multiplier exceeds one , the enhanced effect on national income is called the multiplier effect . The mechanism that can give rise to a multiplier effect is that an initial incremental amount of spending can lead to increased income and hence increased consumption spending , increasing income further and hence further increasing consumption , etc. , resulting in an overall increase in national income greater than the initial incremental amount of spending . In other words , an initial change in aggregate demand may cause a change in aggregate output ( and hence the aggregate income that it generates ) that is a multiple of the initial change ."},{"query":"who wants to be a millionaire winner calls father","short_answer":"","abstract":"John Carpenter ( born c. 1968 ) is an American game show contestant and IRS agent .
