Chemoautotrophs, organisms that obtain carbon through chemosynthesis, are phylogenetically diverse, but also groups that include conspicuous or biogeochemically-important taxa include the sulfur-oxidizing gamma and epsilon proteobacteria, the Aquificae, the methanogenic archaea and the neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany microorganisms in dark regions of the oceans use chemosynthesis to produce biomass from single carbon molecules. Two categories can be distinguished. In the rare sites at which hydrogen molecules (H2) are available, the energy available from the reaction between CO2 and H2 (leading to production of methane, CH4) can be large enough to drive the production of biomass. Alternatively, in most oceanic environments, energy for chemosynthesis derives from reactions in which substances such as hydrogen sulfide or ammonia are oxidized. This may occur with or without the presence of oxygen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany chemosynthetic microorganisms are consumed by other organisms in the ocean, and symbiotic associations between chemosynthesizers and respiring heterotrophs are quite common. Large populations of animals can be supported by chemosynthetic secondary production at hydrothermal vents, methane clathrates, cold seeps, whale falls, and isolated cave water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been hypothesized that chemosynthesis may support life below the surface of Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, and other planets.[1] Chemosynthesis may have also been the first type of metabolism that evolved on Earth, leading the way for cellular respiration and photosynthesis to develop later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGiant tube worms use bacteria in their trophosome to fix carbon dioxide (using hydrogen sulfide as an energy source) and produce sugars and amino acids.[2]\\r\\nSome reactions produce sulfur:\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of releasing oxygen gas while fixing carbon dioxide as in photosynthesis, hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis produces solid globules of sulfur in the process. In bacteria capable of chemoautotrophy (a form a chemosynthesis), such as purple sulfur bacteria[4], yellow globules of sulfur are present and visible in the cytoplasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1890, Sergei Nikolaevich Vinogradskii (or Winogradsky) proposed a novel type of life process called \\"anorgoxydant\\". His discovery suggested that some microbes could live solely on inorganic matter and emerged during his physiological research in the 1880s in Strassburg and Zurich on sulfur, iron, and nitrogen bacteria.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1897, Wilhelm Pfeffer coined the term \\"chemosynthesis\\" for the energy production by oxidation of inorganic substances, in association with autotrophic carbon dioxide assimilation - what would be named today as chemolithoautotrophy. Later, the term would be expanded to include also chemoorganoautotrophs, which are organisms that use organic energy substrates in order to assimilate carbon dioxide.[5] Thus, chemosynthesis can be seen as a synonym of chemoautotrophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"chemotrophy\\", less restrictive, would be introduced in the 1940s by Andr Lwoff for the production of energy by the oxidation of electron donors, organic or not, associated with auto- or heterotrophy.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe suggestion of Vinogradskii was confirmed nearly 90 years later, when hydrothermal ocean vents were predicted to exist in the 1970s. The hot springs and strange creatures were discovered by Alvin, the world's first deep-sea submersible, in 1977 at the Galapagos Rift. At about the same time, Harvard graduate student Colleen Cavanaugh proposed chemosynthetic bacteria that oxidize sulfides or elemental sulfur as a mechanism by which tube worms could survive near hydrothermal vents. Cavanaugh later managed to confirm that this was indeed the method by which the worms could thrive, and is generally credited with the discovery of chemosynthesis.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2004 television series hosted by Bill Nye named chemosynthesis as one of the 100 greatest scientific discoveries of all time.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, researchers reported their discovery of bacteria living in the rock of the oceanic crust below the thick layers of sediment, and apart from the hydrothermal vents that form along the edges of the tectonic plates.  Preliminary findings are that these bacteria subsist on the hydrogen produced by chemical reduction of olivine by seawater circulating in the small veins that permeate the basalt that comprises oceanic crust.

First described by Albert Gnther in 1864, it is the longest species of venomous snake indigenous to the African continent; mature specimens generally exceed 2 meters (6.6?ft) and commonly attain 3 meters (10?ft). Specimens of 4.3 to 4.5 meters (14.1 to 14.8?ft) have been reported. Its skin colour varies from grey to dark brown. Juvenile black mambas tend to be paler than adults and darken with age.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black mamba inhabits savannah, woodlands, rocky slopes and, in some regions, dense forest. The black mamba is both terrestrial and arboreal. It is diurnal and is known to prey on hyrax, bushbabies and other small mammals, as well as birds. Over suitable surfaces, it is possibly the fastest species of snake, capable of at least 11?km/h (6.8?mph) over short distances. Adult mambas have few natural predators.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a threat display, the mamba usually opens its inky-black mouth, spreads its narrow neck-flap and sometimes hisses. It is capable of striking at considerable range and may occasionally deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of potent neurotoxins that may cause a fast onset of symptoms. Despite its reputation as formidable and highly aggressive, it usually attempts to flee from humans unless threatened or cornered. The black mamba is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the black mamba had been known to missionaries[4] and residents,[5] before 1860, the first formal description was made by German-British zoologist Albert Gnther in 1864.[2][3] A single specimen was one of many snake species collected by Dr John Kirk, a naturalist who accompanied Dr David Livingstone on the Second Zambesi expedition.[6] The specific epithet polylepis is derived from the Ancient Greek poly (?) meaning \\"many\\" and lepis (??) meaning \\"scale\\".[7] The term \\"mamba\\" is derived from the Zulu word \\"imamba\\".[8] A local Ngindo name in Tanzania is ndemalunyayo \\"grass-cutter\\" as it supposedly clips grass.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1873, German naturalist Wilhelm Peters described Dendraspis Antinorii from a specimen in the museum of Genoa, which had been killed by Orazio Antinori in what is now northern Eritrea.[10] This was subsequently regarded as a subspecies,[3] and is no longer held to be distinct.[2] In 1896,  Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger combined the species (Dendroaspis polylepis) as a whole with the eastern green mamba (Dendroaspis angusticeps),[11] a lumping diagnosis that remained in force until 1946, when South African herpetologist Vivian FitzSimons split them again into separate species.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black mamba is an elapid snake within the genus Dendroaspis.  A 2016 genetic analysis showed that the black and eastern green mambas were each others' closest relatives, and more distantly related to Jameson's mamba.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black mamba is a long, slender, cylindrical snake with a \\"coffin-shaped\\" head and a somewhat pronounced brow ridge and a medium-sized eye.[14][15] The adult snake's length typically ranges from 2ÿ3?m (6?ft 7?inÿ9?ft 10?in) but specimens have grown to lengths of 4.3 to 4.5?m (14.1 to 14.8?ft).[12][15] It is the second longest venomous snake species, exceeded in length only by the king cobra.[16] The black mamba is a proteroglyphous snake, with fangs up to 6.5?mm (0.26?in) in length.[17] located at the front of the maxilla.[16] The tail of the species is long and thin, and is 17ÿ25% of its body length.[14] Black mambas weigh about 1.6?kg (3.5?lb) on average.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecimens vary considerably in color; some may be olive, yellowish-brown, khaki or gunmetal, but are rarely black. Some individuals may a have a purplish glow to their scales. Occasionally they may display dark mottling towards the posterior, which may appear in the form of diagonal crossbands. They have greyish-white underbellies while the inside of the mouth is dark bluish-grey to nearly black. Mamba eyes are greyish brown to shades of black while the pupil is surrounded by silvery white or yellow color. Juvenile snakes are lighter in color than adults, typically grey or olive green in appearance, and get darker as they age.[17][12][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head, body and tail scalation of the black mamba:[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black mamba has a wide range within sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, it has been observed in north east Democratic Republic of the Congo, south western Sudan to Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, eastern Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, south to Mozambique, Swaziland, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana to KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, and Namibia; then northeast across Angola to south eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.[17][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black mamba's distribution contains gaps within the Central African Republic, Chad, Nigeria and Mali. These gaps may lead physicians to misidentify black mamba bites and administer an inappropriate antivenom. In 1954 the  black mamba was recorded in, in the Dakar region of Senegal. However, this observation, and a subsequent observation that identified a second specimen in the region in 1956, has not been confirmed and thus the snake's distribution in this area is inconclusive.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black mamba prefers moderately dry environments such as light woodland and scrub, rocky outcrops, and semi-arid savannah.[19] It also inhabits moist savanna and lowland forests.[15] It is not commonly found at altitudes above 1,000 metres (3,300?ft), although its distribution does include 1,800 metres (5,900?ft) in Kenya and 1,650 metres (5,410?ft) in Zambia.[19] It is rated as a species of least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species, based on its huge range across sub-Saharan Africa and no documented decline.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black mamba is both terrestrial and arboreal. It moves on the ground with its head and neck raised and typically uses termite mounds, abandoned burrows, rock crevices and tree cracks as shelter. It may share its lair with other snake species like the Egyptian cobra. Black mambas are diurnal and in South Africa, they are recorded to bask from 7ÿ10 am and again from 2ÿ4 pm. They may return to the same basking site daily.[15][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black mamba is graceful but skittish and often unpredictable. It is agile and can move quickly.[17][15] When it senses a perceived threat, it retreats into brush or a hole.[15] In the wild, a black mamba seldom tolerates humans approaching more closely than about 40 meters.[15] When confronted it is likely to gape in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and flicking its tongue.[17] It also is likely to form a narrow hood by spreading its neck-flap. The threat display may be accompanied by hissing.[18][17][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the threat display, any sudden movement by the intruder may provoke the mamba into a series of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation.[15] Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its ability to raise its head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans may occur on the upper body.[17][15] The black mamba's reputation for being ready to attack is exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its movements and ability to retreat,  accidentally or otherwise.[17] The black mamba's reputed speed has also been exaggerated. It can slither at no more than 16?km/h (9.9?mph).[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack mambas breed from April to June.[12] During the mating season rival males may compete by wrestling. Opponents attempt to subdue each other by intertwining their bodies and wrestling with their necks. Some observers have mistaken this for courtship.[15][14] During mating, the male will slither over the dorsal side of the female while flicking his tongue. The female will signal she is ready to mate by lifting her tail and staying still. The male will then coil around the posterior end of the female and align his tail with hers ventrolaterally. Intermission may last longer than two hours and the pair would stay motionless apart from occasional spasms from the male.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black mamba is oviparous; the female laying 6ÿ17 eggs in a clutch.[15] The eggs are oval-shaped and enlongated, measuring 60ÿ80?mm (2.4ÿ3.1?in) long and 30ÿ36?mm (1.2ÿ1.4?in) in diameter. When hatched, the young range from 40ÿ60?cm (16ÿ24?in) in length. They may grow quickly, reaching 2?m (6?ft 7?in) after their first year. Like the adults, juvenile mambas can be deadly.[15][17] The black mamba is recorded to live up to 11 years, possibly longer.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black mamba usually goes hunting from a permanent lair, to which it will regularly return if there is no disturbance. It mostly preys on birds, particularly nestlings and fledglings, and small mammals like rodents, bats, hyraxes and bushbabies. They generally prefer warm-blooded prey but will consume other snakes. The black mamba does not typically hold onto prey after biting, instead releasing its quarry and waiting for it to succumb to paralysis and die. It has a potent digestive system and has been recorded to fully digest prey between eight and ten hours.[15][17][12][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are few predators of adult mambas, aside from birds of prey. Young snakes have been recorded as prey of the Cape file snake.[12] Mongooses, which have some immunity to the venom, and are often quick enough to evade a bite, will sometimes tackle a black mamba for prey.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black mamba is popularly regarded as the most dangerous and feared snake in Africa.[22] However, attacks on humans by black mambas are rare, as they usually try to avoid confrontation, and their occurrence in highly populated areas is not very common compared with some other species.[23] Additionally, the ocellated carpet viper is responsible for more human fatalities due to snakebite than all other African species combined.[24] A survey of snakebites in South Africa from 1957 to 1963 recorded over 900 venomous snakebites, but only seven of these were confirmed black mamba bites, at a time when effective antivenom was not widely available. Out of more than 900 bites, only 21 ended in fatalities, including all seven black mamba bites.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, the proteome (complete protein profile) was assessed and published, revealing 41 distinct proteins and one nucleoside.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black mamba's venom is composed of neurotoxins (dendrotoxin) and cardiotoxins as well as other toxins such as fasciculins.[27][28] In an experiment, the most abundant toxin found in black mamba venom was observed to be able to kill a mouse in as little as 4.5 minutes.[22] Based on the murine median lethal dose (LD50) values, the black mamba's toxicity from all published sources is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis venom is extremely toxic. A bite from a black mamba can deliver about 100ÿ120?mg of venom on average and the maximum dose recorded is 400?mg.[27] It is reported that before antivenom was widely available, the mortality rate from a bite was nearly 100%.[18] The bite of a black mamba can potentially cause collapse in humans within 45 minutes, or less.[35] Without effective antivenom therapy, death typically occurs in 7ÿ15 hours.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nA bite from a black mamba causes initial neurological and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, which may be accompanied by a triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation.[36] Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar palsy.[36] Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe;[37] therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity.[36] Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.[27][28][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeptides in black mamba venom have been found to be effective analgesics. These peptides, part of the 'three-finger' family of snake venom toxins (mambalgins), act as inhibitors for acid-sensing ion channels in the central and peripheral nervous system, causing a pain-inihibiting effect. While this effect can be as strong as that of morphine, mambalgins do not have a resistance to naloxone, suffer less from induced tolerance, and cause no respiratory distress.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nDanie Pienaar, now head of South African National Parks Scientific Services,[39] survived the bite of a black mamba without antivenom in 1998. Although no antivenom was administered, Pienaar was in a serious condition, despite the hospital physicians having declared it a \\"moderate\\" black mamba envenomation. At one point, Pienaar lapsed into a coma and his prognosis was declared \\"poor\\". Upon arrival at hospital Pienaar was immediately intubated, given supportive drug therapy, put on mechanical ventilation and placed on life support for three days, until the toxins were flushed out of his system. He was released from hospital on the fifth day. Pienaar believes he survived for several reasons. In an article in Kruger Park Times he said \\"Firstly, it was not my time to go.\\" The article went on to state, \\"The fact that he stayed calm and moved slowly definitely helped. The tourniquet was also essential.\\"[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was bitten by a black mamba and died in March 2008. The black mamba had been found near a classroom at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed and died of a heart attack, nearly an hour after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard first aid treatment for any suspected bite from a venomous snake is for a pressure bandage to the bite site, the victim to move as  little as possible, and to be conveyed to a hospital or clinic, where they should be monitored for at least 24 hours. Tetanus toxoid is given, though the mainstay of treatment is the administration of the appropriate anitvenom.[43] Presently, there is a polyvalent antivenom produced by the South African Institute for Medical Research to treat black mamba bites from many localities,[44] and a new antivenom is currently being developed by the Universidad de Costa Rica's Instituto Clodomiro Picado.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Dendroaspis polylepis at Wikimedia Commons","input":"How does a black mamba kill its prey?"},{"output":"the Golden Gate","context":"The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6?km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the American city of San Francisco, California ÿ the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula ÿ to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and the United States. It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[7]\\r\\nThe Frommer's travel guide describes the Golden Gate Bridge as \\"possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world.\\"[8] It opened in 1937 and was, until 1964, the longest suspension bridge main span in the world, at 4,200 feet (1,280?m).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the bridge was built, the only practical short route between San Francisco and what is now Marin County was by boat across a section of San Francisco Bay. A ferry service began as early as 1820, with a regularly scheduled service beginning in the 1840s for the purpose of transporting water to San Francisco.[9]\\r\\nThe Sausalito Land and Ferry Company service, launched in 1867, eventually became the Golden Gate Ferry Company, a Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the largest ferry operation in the world by the late 1920s.[9][10] Once for railroad passengers and customers only, Southern Pacific's automobile ferries became very profitable and important to the regional economy.[11] The ferry crossing between the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco and Sausalito in Marin County took approximately 20 minutes and cost US$1.00 per vehicle, a price later reduced to compete with the new bridge.[12] The trip from the San Francisco Ferry Building took 27 minutes.\\r\\nMany wanted to build a bridge to connect San Francisco to Marin County. San Francisco was the largest American city still served primarily by ferry boats. Because it did not have a permanent link with communities around the bay, the city's growth rate was below the national average.[13] Many experts said that a bridge could not be built across the 6,700?ft (2,042?m) strait, which had strong, swirling tides and currents, with water 372?ft (113?m) deep[14] at the center of the channel, and frequent strong winds. Experts said that ferocious winds and blinding fogs would prevent construction and operation.[13]\\r\\nAlthough the idea of a bridge spanning the Golden Gate was not new, the proposal that eventually took hold was made in a 1916 San Francisco Bulletin article by former engineering student James Wilkins.[15] San Francisco's City Engineer estimated the cost at $100 million, which would have been $2.12 billion in 2009, and impractical for the time. He asked bridge engineers whether it could be built for less.[9] One who responded, Joseph Strauss, was an ambitious engineer and poet who had, for his graduate thesis, designed a 55-mile-long (89?km) railroad bridge across the Bering Strait.[16] At the time, Strauss had completed some 400 drawbridgesmost of which were inlandand nothing on the scale of the new project.[3] Strauss's initial drawings[15] were for a massive cantilever on each side of the strait, connected by a central suspension segment, which Strauss promised could be built for $17?million.[9]\\r\\nLocal authorities agreed to proceed only on the assurance that Strauss would alter the design and accept input from several consulting project experts.[citation needed] A suspension-bridge design was considered the most practical, because of recent advances in metallurgy.[9]\\r\\nStrauss spent more than a decade drumming up support in Northern California.[17] The bridge faced opposition, including litigation, from many sources. The Department of War was concerned that the bridge would interfere with ship traffic. The navy feared that a ship collision or sabotage to the bridge could block the entrance to one of its main harbors. Unions demanded guarantees that local workers would be favored for construction jobs. Southern Pacific Railroad, one of the most powerful business interests in California, opposed the bridge as competition to its ferry fleet and filed a lawsuit against the project, leading to a mass boycott of the ferry service.[9]\\r\\nIn May 1924, Colonel Herbert Deakyne held the second hearing on the Bridge on behalf of the Secretary of War in a request to use federal land for construction. Deakyne, on behalf of the Secretary of War, approved the transfer of land needed for the bridge structure and leading roads to the \\"Bridging the Golden Gate Association\\" and both San Francisco County and Marin County, pending further bridge plans by Strauss.[18] Another ally was the fledgling automobile industry, which supported the development of roads and bridges to increase demand for automobiles.[12]\\r\\nThe bridge's name was first used when the project was initially discussed in 1917 by M.M. O'Shaughnessy, city engineer of San Francisco, and Strauss. The name became official with the passage of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District Act by the state legislature in 1923, creating a special district to design, build and finance the bridge.[19] San Francisco and most of the counties along the North Coast of California joined the Golden Gate Bridge District, with the exception being Humboldt County, whose residents opposed the bridge's construction and the traffic it would generate.[20]\\r\\nStrauss was chief engineer in charge of overall design and construction of the bridge project.[13] However, because he had little understanding or experience with cable-suspension designs,[21] responsibility for much of the engineering and architecture fell on other experts. Strauss's initial design proposal (two double cantilever spans linked by a central suspension segment) was unacceptable from a visual standpoint. The final graceful suspension design was conceived and championed by Leon Moisseiff, the engineer of the Manhattan Bridge in New York City.[22]\\r\\nIrving Morrow, a relatively unknown residential architect, designed the overall shape of the bridge towers, the lighting scheme, and Art Deco elements, such as the tower decorations, streetlights, railing, and walkways. The famous International Orange color was originally used as a sealant for the bridge.[23] The US Navy had wanted it to be painted with black and yellow stripes to ensure visibility by passing ships.[13]\\r\\nSenior engineer Charles Alton Ellis, collaborating remotely with Moisseiff, was the principal engineer of the project.[24] Moisseiff produced the basic structural design, introducing his \\"deflection theory\\" by which a thin, flexible roadway would flex in the wind, greatly reducing stress by transmitting forces via suspension cables to the bridge towers.[24] Although the Golden Gate Bridge design has proved sound, a later Moisseiff design, the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, collapsed in a strong windstorm soon after it was completed, because of an unexpected aeroelastic flutter.[25] Ellis was also tasked with designing a \\"bridge within a bridge\\" in the southern abutment, to avoid the need to demolish Fort Point, a preÿCivil War masonry fortification viewed, even then, as worthy of historic preservation. He penned a graceful steel arch spanning the fort and carrying the roadway to the bridge's southern anchorage.[26]\\r\\nEllis was a Greek scholar and mathematician who at one time was a University of Illinois professor of engineering despite having no engineering degree. He eventually earned a degree in civil engineering from the University of Illinois prior to designing the Golden Gate Bridge and spent the last twelve years of his career as a professor at Purdue University. He became an expert in structural design, writing the standard textbook of the time.[27] Ellis did much of the technical and theoretical work that built the bridge, but he received none of the credit in his lifetime. In November 1931, Strauss fired Ellis and replaced him with a former subordinate, Clifford Paine, ostensibly for wasting too much money sending telegrams back and forth to Moisseiff.[27] Ellis, obsessed with the project and unable to find work elsewhere during the Depression, continued working 70 hours per week on an unpaid basis, eventually turning in ten volumes of hand calculations.[27]\\r\\nWith an eye toward self-promotion and posterity, Strauss downplayed the contributions of his collaborators who, despite receiving little recognition or compensation,[21] are largely responsible for the final form of the bridge. He succeeded in having himself credited as the person most responsible for the design and vision of the bridge.[27] Only much later were the contributions of the others on the design team properly appreciated.[27] In May 2007, the Golden Gate Bridge District issued a formal report on 70 years of stewardship of the famous bridge and decided to give Ellis major credit for the design of the bridge.\\r\\nThe Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District, authorized by an act of the California Legislature, was incorporated in 1928 as the official entity to design, construct, and finance the Golden Gate Bridge.[13] However, after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the District was unable to raise the construction funds, so it lobbied for a $30?million bond measure. The bonds were approved in November 1930,[16] by votes in the counties affected by the bridge.[28] The construction budget at the time of approval was $27?million. However, the District was unable to sell the bonds until 1932, when Amadeo Giannini, the founder of San Franciscoÿbased Bank of America, agreed on behalf of his bank to buy the entire issue in order to help the local economy.[9]\\r\\nConstruction began on January 5, 1933.[9] The project cost more than $35?million,[29] completing ahead of schedule and $1.3 million under budget.[30] The Golden Gate Bridge construction project was carried out by the McClintic-Marshall Construction Co., a subsidiary of Bethlehem Steel Corporation founded by Howard H. McClintic and Charles D. Marshall, both of Lehigh University.\\r\\nStrauss remained head of the project, overseeing day-to-day construction and making some groundbreaking contributions. A graduate of the University of Cincinnati, he placed a brick from his alma mater's demolished McMicken Hall in the south anchorage before the concrete was poured. He innovated the use of movable safety netting beneath the construction site, which saved the lives of many otherwise-unprotected ironworkers. Of eleven men killed from falls during construction, ten were killed on February 17, 1937, when the bridge was near completion when the net failed under the stress of a scaffold that had fallen.[31] According to Travel Channel's Monumental Mysteries, the workers' platform that was attached to a rolling hanger on a track collapsed when the bolts that were connected to the track were too small and the amount of weight was too great to bear. The platform fell into the safety net, but was too heavy and the net gave way. Two out of the twelve workers survived the 200-foot (61?m) fall into the icy waters, including the 37-year-old foreman, Slim Lambert. Nineteen others who were saved by the net over the course of construction became members of their Half Way to Hell Club.[32]\\r\\nThe project was finished and opened May 27, 1937. The Bridge Round House diner was then included in the southeastern end of the Golden Gate Bridge, adjacent to the tourist plaza which was renovated in 2012.[33] The Bridge Round House, an Art Deco design by Alfred Finnila completed in 1938, has been popular throughout the years as a starting point for various commercial tours of the bridge and an unofficial gift shop.[34] The diner was renovated in 2012[33] and the gift shop was then removed as a new, official gift shop has been included in the adjacent plaza.[34]\\r\\nDuring the bridge work, the Assistant Civil Engineer of California Alfred Finnila had overseen the entire iron work of the bridge as well as half of the bridge's road work.[35] With the death of Jack Balestreri in April 2012, all workers involved in the original construction are now deceased.\\r\\nThe bridge-opening celebration began on May 27, 1937 and lasted for one week. The day before vehicle traffic was allowed, 200,000 people crossed either on foot or on roller skates.[9] On opening day, Mayor Angelo Rossi and other officials rode the ferry to Marin, then crossed the bridge in a motorcade past three ceremonial \\"barriers\\", the last a blockade of beauty queens who required Joseph Strauss to present the bridge to the Highway District before allowing him to pass. An official song, \\"There's a Silver Moon on the Golden Gate\\", was chosen to commemorate the event. Strauss wrote a poem that is now on the Golden Gate Bridge entitled \\"The Mighty Task is Done.\\" The next day, President Roosevelt pushed a button in Washington, D.C. signaling the official start of vehicle traffic over the Bridge at noon. As the celebration got out of hand there was a small riot in the uptown Polk Gulch area. Weeks of civil and cultural activities called \\"the Fiesta\\" followed. A statue of Strauss was moved in 1955 to a site near the bridge.[15]\\r\\nIn May 1987, as part of the 50th anniversary celebration, the Golden Gate Bridge district again closed the bridge to automobile traffic and allowed pedestrians to cross the bridge. However, this celebration attracted 750,000 to 1,000,000 people, and ineffective crowd control meant the bridge became congested with roughly 300,000 people, causing the center span of the bridge to flatten out under the weight.[36] Although the bridge is designed to flex in that way under heavy loads, and was estimated not to have exceeded 40% of the yielding stress of the suspension cables,[37] bridge officials stated that uncontrolled pedestrian access was not being considered as part of the 75th anniversary on Sunday, May 27, 2012,[38][39][40] because of the additional law enforcement costs required \\"since 9/11\\".[41]\\r\\nA pedestrian poses at the old railing on opening day, 1937\\r\\nOpening of the Golden Gate Bridge\\r\\nOfficial invitation to the opening of the bridge. This copy was sent to the City of Seattle\\r\\nUntil 1964, the Golden Gate Bridge had the longest suspension bridge main span in the world, at 4,200 feet (1,300?m). Since 1964 its main span length has been surpassed by ten bridges; it now has the second-longest main span in the United States, after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City. The total length of the Golden Gate Bridge from abutment to abutment is 8,981 feet (2,737?m).\\r\\nThe Golden Gate Bridge's clearance above high water averages 220 feet (67?m) while its towers, at 746 feet (227?m) above the water, were the world's tallest on a suspension bridge until 1998 when bridges in Denmark and Japan were completed.\\r\\nThe weight of the roadway is hung from two cables that pass through the two main towers and are fixed in concrete at each end. Each cable is made of 27,572 strands of wire. There are 80,000 miles (130,000?km) of wire in the main cables.[42] The bridge has approximately 1,200,000 total rivets.\\r\\nThe color of the bridge is officially an orange vermilion called international orange.[43] The color was selected by consulting architect Irving Morrow[44] because it complements the natural surroundings and enhances the bridge's visibility in fog. Aesthetics was the foremost reason why the first design of Joseph Strauss was rejected. Upon re-submission of his bridge construction plan, he added details, such as lighting, to outline the bridge's cables and towers.[45] In 1999, it was ranked fifth on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.\\r\\nThe bridge was originally painted with red lead primer and a lead-based topcoat, which was touched up as required. In the mid-1960s, a program was started to improve corrosion protection by stripping the original paint and repainting the bridge with zinc silicate primer and vinyl topcoats.[46][47] Since 1990, acrylic topcoats have been used instead for air-quality reasons. The program was completed in 1995 and it is now maintained by 38 painters who touch up the paintwork where it becomes seriously corroded.[48]\\r\\nA view of the Golden Gate Bridge from the Marin Headlands on a foggy morning at sunrise\\r\\nView of the northern tower of the bridge\\r\\nMost maps and signage mark the bridge as part of the concurrency between U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1. Although part of the National Highway System, the bridge is not officially part of California's Highway System.[49] For example, under the California Streets and Highways Code  401, Route 101 ends at \\"the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge\\" and then resumes at \\"a point in Marin County opposite San Francisco\\". The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District has jurisdiction over the segment of highway that crosses the bridge instead of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).\\r\\nThe movable median barrier between the lanes is moved several times daily to conform to traffic patterns. On weekday mornings, traffic flows mostly southbound into the city, so four of the six lanes run southbound. Conversely, on weekday afternoons, four lanes run northbound. During off-peak periods and weekends, traffic is split with three lanes in each direction.[50]\\r\\nFrom 1968 to 2015, opposing traffic was separated by small, plastic pylons, and during that time, there were 16 fatalities resulting from 128 head-on collisions.[51] To improve safety, the speed limit on the Golden Gate Bridge was reduced from 50 to 45?mph (80 to 72?km/h) on October 1, 1989.[52] Although there had been discussion concerning the installation of a movable barrier since the 1980s, only in March 2005 did the Bridge Board of Directors commit to finding funding to complete the $2?million study required prior to the installation of a movable median barrier.[51] Installation of the resulting barrier was completed on January 11, 2015, following a closure of 45.5 hours to private vehicle traffic, the longest in the bridge's history. The new barrier system, including the zipper trucks, cost approximately $30.3 million to purchase and install.[51][53]\\r\\nThe bridge is popular with pedestrians and bicyclists, and was built with walkways on either side of the six vehicle traffic lanes. Initially, they were separated from the traffic lanes by only a metal curb, but railings between the walkways and the traffic lanes were added in 2003, primarily as a measure to prevent bicyclists from falling into the roadway.[54]\\r\\nThe main walkway is on the eastern side, and is open for use by both pedestrians and bicycles in the morning to mid-afternoon during weekdays (5 am to 3:30?pm), and to pedestrians only for the remaining daylight hours (until 6?pm, or 9?pm during DST). The eastern walkway is reserved for pedestrians on weekends (5 am to 6?pm, or 9?pm during DST), and is open exclusively to bicyclists in the evening and overnight, when it is closed to pedestrians. The western walkway is open only for bicyclists and only during the hours when they are not allowed on the eastern walkway.[55]\\r\\nBus service across the bridge is provided by two public transportation agencies: San Francisco Muni and Golden Gate Transit. Muni offers Saturday and Sunday service on the Marin Headlands Express bus line, and Golden Gate Transit runs numerous bus lines throughout the week.[56][57] The southern end of the bridge, near the toll plaza and parking lot, is also accessible daily from 5:30?a.m. to midnight by Muni line 28.[58] The Marin Airporter, a private company, also offers service across the bridge between Marin County and San Francisco International Airport.[59]\\r\\nA visitor center and gift shop, dubbed the \\"Bridge Pavilion\\", is located on the San Francisco side of the bridge, adjacent to the southeast parking lot. It opened in 2012, in time for the bridge's 75th anniversary celebration. A cafe, outdoor exhibits, and restroom facilities are located nearby.[60] On the Marin side of the bridge, only accessible from the northbound lanes, is the H. Dana Bower Rest Area and Vista Point,[61] named after the first landscape architect for the California Division of Highways.[62]\\r\\nLands and waters under and around the bridge are homes to varieties of wildlife such as bobcats and sea lions.[63][64] Three species of cetaceans that had been absent in the area for many years show recent recoveries/(re)colonizations vicinity to the bridge, and researchers study them to strengthen protections, concerning actions by public and recommending to watch whales either from the bridge and nearby, or to use a local whale watching operator.[65][66][67]\\r\\nThe last of the construction bonds were retired in 1971, with $35?million in principal and nearly $39?million in interest raised entirely from bridge tolls.[68]\\r\\nIn November 2006, the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District recommended a corporate sponsorship program for the bridge to address its operating deficit, projected at $80?million over five years. The District promised that the proposal, which it called a \\"partnership program,\\" would not include changing the name of the bridge or placing advertising on the bridge itself. In October 2007, the Board unanimously voted to discontinue the proposal and seek additional revenue through other means, most likely a toll increase.[69][70]\\r\\nIn an effort to save $19.2?million over the following 10 years, the Golden Gate District voted in January 2011 to eliminate all toll takers by 2012 and use only open road tolling.[71] Subsequently, this was delayed and toll taker elimination occurred in March 2013. The cost savings have been revised to $19 million over an eight-year period. In addition to the FasTrak electronic toll collection system, the Golden Gate District implemented the use of license plate tolling (branded as \\"Pay-by-Plate\\"), and also a one time payment system for drivers to pay before or after their trip on the bridge. Twenty-eight positions were eliminated as part of this plan.[72]\\r\\nOn April 7, 2014, the toll for users of FasTrak was increased from $5 to $6, while the toll for drivers using either the license plate tolling or the one time payment system was raised from $6 to $7. Bicycle, pedestrian, and northbound motor vehicle traffic remain toll free. For vehicles with more than two axles, the toll rate is $7 per axle for those using license plate tolling or the one time payment system, and $6 per axle for FasTrak users. During peak traffic hours, carpool vehicles carrying two or more people and motorcycles pay a discounted toll of $4; drivers must have Fastrak to take advantage of this carpool rate.[73] The Golden Gate Transportation District then planned to increase the tolls by 25 cents in July 2015, and then by another 25 cents each of the next three years.[74]\\r\\nIn March 2008, the Golden Gate Bridge District board approved a resolution to start congestion pricing at the Golden Gate Bridge, charging higher tolls during the peak hours, but rising and falling depending on traffic levels. This decision allowed the Bay Area to meet the federal requirement to receive $158?million in federal transportation funds from USDOT Urban Partnership grant.[76] As a condition of the grant, the congestion toll was to be in place by September 2009.[77][78]\\r\\nThe first results of the study, called the Mobility, Access and Pricing Study (MAPS), showed that a congestion pricing program is feasible.[79] The different pricing scenarios considered were presented in public meetings in December 2008.[80]\\r\\nIn August 2008, transportation officials ended the congestion pricing program in favor of varying rates for metered parking along the route to the bridge including on Lombard Street and Van Ness Avenue.[81]\\r\\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is the second-most used suicide site/suicide bridge in the world, after the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.[82] The deck is about 245 feet (75?m) above the water.[83] After a fall of four seconds, jumpers hit the water at around 75?mph or about 120?km/h. Most of the jumpers die from impact trauma. About 5% of the jumpers survive the initial impact but generally drown or die of hypothermia in the cold water.[84][85]\\r\\nAfter years of debate and over an estimated 1,500 deaths, suicide barriers began to be installed in April 2017. Construction will take approximately four years at a cost of over $200 million.[86]\\r\\nSince its completion, the Golden Gate Bridge has been closed because of weather conditions only three times: on December 1, 1951, because of gusts of 69?mph (111?km/h); on December 23, 1982, because of winds of 70?mph (113?km/h); and on December 3, 1983, because of wind gusts of 75?mph (121?km/h).[87]\\r\\nAn anemometer, placed midway between the two towers on the west side of the bridge, has been used to measure wind speeds. Another anemometer was placed on one of the towers.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern knowledge of the effect of earthquakes on structures led to a program to retrofit the Golden Gate to better resist seismic events. The proximity of the bridge to the San Andreas Fault places it at risk for a significant earthquake. Once thought to have been able to withstand any magnitude of foreseeable earthquake, the bridge was actually vulnerable to complete structural failure (i.e., collapse) triggered by the failure of supports on the 320-foot (98?m) arch over Fort Point.[88] A $392?million program was initiated to improve the structure's ability to withstand such an event with only minimal (repairable) damage. One challenging undertaking is completing this program without disrupting traffic. A complex electro-hydraulic synchronous lift system was custom built for construction of temporary support towers and a series of intricate lifts, transferring the loads from the existing bridge onto the temporary supports. This was completed with engineers from Balfour Beatty and Enerpac, accomplishing this task without disrupting day-to-day San Francisco commuter traffic.[89][90] The retrofit was planned to be completed in 2012.[91][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former elevated approach to the Golden Gate Bridge through the San Francisco Presidio, known as Doyle Drive, dated to 1933 and was named after Frank P. Doyle, President and son of the founder of the Exchange Bank in Santa Rosa, and the man who, more than any other person, made it possible to build the Golden Gate Bridge.[93] The highway carried about 91,000 vehicles each weekday between downtown San Francisco and the North Bay and points north.[94] The road was deemed \\"vulnerable to earthquake damage\\", had a problematic 4-lane design, and lacked shoulders, and a San Francisco County Transportation Authority study recommended that it be replaced. Construction on the $1?billion[95] replacement, temporarily known as the Presidio Parkway, began in December 2009.[96] The elevated Doyle Drive was demolished on the weekend of April 27ÿ30, 2012, and traffic used a part of the partially completed Presidio Parkway, until it was switched onto the finished Presidio Parkway on the weekend of July 9ÿ12, 2015. As of May 2012, an official at Caltrans said there is no plan to permanently rename the portion known as Doyle Drive.[97]\\r\\nAs a prominent American landmark, the Golden Gate Bridge has been used in numerous media which includes books, films and video games.","input":"What water does the golden gate bridge cross?"},{"output":"a societal leader","context":"A griot (/?ri.o?/; French pronunciation:??[?i.o]), jali or jeli (djeli or djli in French spelling) is a West African historian, storyteller, praise singer, poet and/or musician. The griot is a repository of oral tradition and is often seen as a societal leader due to his or her traditional position as an advisor to royal personages. As a result of the former of these two functions, he or she is sometimes also called a bard. According to Paul Oliver in his book Savannah Syncopators, \\"Though [the griot] has to know many traditional songs without error, he must also have the ability to extemporize on current events, chance incidents and the passing scene. His wit can be devastating and his knowledge of local history formidable\\". Although they are popularly known as \\"praise singers\\", griots may use their vocal expertise for gossip, satire, or political comment.\\r\\nGriots today live in many parts of West Africa and are present among the Mande peoples (Mandinka, Malink, Bambara, etc.), Ful?e (Fula), Hausa, Songhai, Tukul܇or, Wolof, Serer, Mossi, Dagomba, Mauritanian Arabs and many other smaller groups. The word may derive from the French transliteration \\"guiriot\\" of the Portuguese word \\"criado\\", or masculine singular term for \\"servant\\". These story-tellers are more predominant in the northern portions of West Africa.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn African languages, griots are referred to by a number of names: jeli in northern Mande areas, jali in southern Mande areas, guewel in Wolof, gawlo in Pulaar (Fula), and iggawen in Hassaniyan. Griots form an endogamous caste, meaning that most of them only marry fellow griots and that those who are not griots do not normally perform the same functions that they perform.\\r\\nFrancis Bebey writes about the griot in his book African Music, A People's Art (Lawrence Hill Books):\\r\\n\\"The West African griot is a troubadour, the counterpart of the medieval European minstrel... The griot knows everything that is going on... He is a living archive of the people's traditions... The virtuoso talents of the griots command universal admiration. This virtuosity is the culmination of long years of study and hard work under the tuition of a teacher who is often a father or uncle. The profession is by no means a male prerogative. There are many women griots whose talents as singers and musicians are equally remarkable.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manding term jeliya (meaning \\"musicianhood\\") is sometimes used for the knowledge of griots, indicating the hereditary nature of the class. Jali comes from the root word jali or djali (blood). This word is also the title given to griots in areas corresponding to the former Mali Empire. Though the usage \\"griot\\" is far more common in English, some griot advocates such as Bakari Sumano prefer the term jeli.\\r\\nThe Mali Empire (Malinke Empire), at its height in the middle of the 14th century, extended from central Africa (today's Chad and Niger) to West Africa (today's Mali and Senegal). The empire was founded by Sundiata Keita, whose exploits remain celebrated in Mali today. In the Epic of Sundiata, King Nar Maghann Konat offered his son Sundiata a griot, Balla Fassk, to advise him in his reign. Balla Fassk is considered the founder of the Kouyat line of griots that exists to this day.\\r\\nEach aristocratic family of griots accompanied a higher-ranked family of warrior-kings or emperors, called jatigi. In traditional culture, no griot can be without a jatigi, and no jatigi can be without a griot; the two are inseparable and worthless without the other. However, the jatigi can accept a \\"loan\\" of his griot to another jatigi.\\r\\nMost villages also had their own griot, who told tales of births, deaths, marriages, battles, hunts, affairs, and hundreds of other things.\\r\\nIn Mande society, the jeli was an historian, advisor, arbitrator, praise singer (patronage), and storyteller. Essentially, these musicians were walking history books, preserving their ancient stories and traditions through song. Their inherited tradition was passed down through generations. Their name, jeli, means \\"blood\\" in Manika language. They were said to have deep connections to spiritual, social, or political powers as music is associated as such. Speech is said to have power as it can recreate history and relationships.\\r\\nDespite the authority of griots and the perceived power of their songs, griots are not treated as positively in west Africa as we may imagine. In fact, as Thomas A. Hale puts it: \\" Another [reason for ambivalence towards griots] is an ancient tradition that marks them as a separate people categorized all too simplistically as members of a \\"caste,\\" a term that has come under increasing attack as a distortion of the social structure in the region. In the worst case, that difference meant burial for griots in trees rather than in the ground in order to avoid polluting the earth (Conrad and Frank 1995:4-7). Today, although these traditions are changing, griots and people of griot origin still find it very difficult to marry outside of the group of artisans to which they belong.\\"[2] Fortunately, such discrimination is now deemed illegal.\\r\\nIn addition to being singers and social commentators, griots are often skilled musicians. Their instruments include the kora, the khalam (also spelled xalam), the goje (called n'ko in the Mandinka language), the balafon and the ngoni.\\r\\nThe kora is a long-necked lute-like instrument.with 21 strings. The xalam is a variation of the kora, and usually consists of less than 5 string. Both have gourd bodies that act as resonator. The ngoni is also similar to these two instruments, and has 5 to 6 strings. The balafon is a wooden xylophone, while the goje is a stringed instruments that is played with a bow, much like a fiddle.\\r\\nAccording to the Encyclop?dia Britannica: \\"West African plucked lutes such as the konting, khalam, and the nkoni (which was noted by Ibn Ba???ah in 1353) may have originated in ancient Egypt. The khalam is claimed to be the ancestor of the banjo. Another long-necked lute is the ramkie of South Africa.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nGriots also wrote stories for their time that younger children enjoyed listening too. these stories were passed down from them to their kids and so on.\\r\\nToday, performing is one of the most common functions of a griot. Their range of exposure has widened, and many griots now travel all over the world singing and playing the kora or other instruments. Bakari Sumano, head of the Association of Bamako Griots in Mali from 1994 to 2003, was an internationally-known advocate for the importance of the griot in West African society.","input":"What role did griots play in west african society?"},{"output":"Nebula","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nKaren Gillan (born 28 November 1987)[1] is a Scottish actress, director, screenwriter and model.

Bundesliga club SC Freiburg. He returned to the club twice (1982, 1985) and holds the club's overall goal scoring record.[1] In 1980, L?w joined VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga, but he had difficulties establishing himself in the starting lineup and played only four matches.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1981ÿ82 season, L?w played for Eintracht Frankfurt (24 matches, five goals), but he returned to Freiburg the following year.

Klinsmann and L?w had met years earlier at a coaching school and both shared a philosophy focused on attacking football. Under their reign, Klinsmann and L?w's German team reached the semi-final stage at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany lost 3ÿ2 to Brazil in the semi-final of the 2005 Confederations Cup.

A last minute 1ÿ0 win over Poland and a 3ÿ0 over Ecuador followed. Germany defeated Sweden in the round of 16 with two Lukas Podolski goals, followed by a grueling battle with Argentina. In the penalties after finishing extra time at 1ÿ1, the coaching staff gave Jens Lehmann a prepared list of possible Argentinian penalty takers and their preferred way to shoot, which was reported to have helped ensure Germany's victory. The semi-final match with Italy was a disappointment however, with the hosts falling 2ÿ0 after reaching the 119th minute in extra time with the score at 0ÿ0. Germany, however, turned in a dominant performance against Portugal in the third place match, winning 3ÿ1 on two Bastian Schweinsteiger goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides a focus on attacking football and youth development, Klinsmann's staff also introduced an alternative B-team: Team 2006, to experiment with new aspiring players suitable to play at the home World Cup. Also introduced were an enhanced fitness coaching staff, as well as Oliver Bierhoff as \\"Business Manager\\" ÿ this job revolves around public relations, general management and everything not directly related to coaching ÿ and finally a mental coach, Dr. Hans-Dieter Hermann, who has the job of preparing the German players for stressful situations in major tournaments.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 July 2006,[11] following Klinsmann's decision not to renew his contract, L?w was named as the new manager of Germany. L?w obtained a contract for two years and announced that he wanted to continue in the philosophy developed with Klinsmann to play with an offensive style. L?w was particularly concerned with the amount of time his players hold on to the ball before passing. During his tenure, he reduced this time significantly, increasing the pace of the German game. He declared that his aim was to win Euro 2008. His first game in charge, a friendly against Sweden in Gelsenkirchen on 16 August 2006,[25] was a 3ÿ0 success in which Miroslav Klose scored twice and Bernd Schneider scored the other.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nL?w had a successful start in qualifying for Euro 2008 with wins over the Republic of Ireland[27] and San Marino.[28] On 7 October 2006, Germany won 2ÿ0 against Georgia in the Ostseestadion in Rostock,[29] which was the fourth consecutive success for L?w and his team,[29] the best start of a new head coach of the German national team ever. The team extended this record to five wins in the next match, the Euro 2008 qualifier against Slovakia in Bratislava on 11 October, with a 4ÿ1 victory.[30] The Slovaks' strike was the first goal conceded by Germany under L?w's reign.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next match saw the end of L?w's perfect record, with the qualifying match on 15 November in Nicosia against Cyprus ending in a disappointing 1ÿ1 draw.[31] 2007 started with a 3ÿ1 win against Switzerland on 7 February and a 2ÿ1 win against the Czech Republic on 24 March.[32] L?w's first loss as manager came in his eighth game on 28 March 2007, an experimental squad lost 0ÿ1 against Denmark.[33] He had given Robert Enke and Patrick Helmes their debuts.[33] When qualification for Euro 2008 was ensured, L?w's record stood at 11 wins, 1 loss and 1 draw from 13 matches and a 41:6 goal difference. This includes the first win over England in London's new Wembley Stadium.[34] Germany lost to the Czech Republic in qualifying on 17 October 2007.[35] This was the second loss for L?w.[35] Germany finished qualifying in second place.[36] In the final match of 2007, Germany and Wales finished in a 0ÿ0 draw.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany started 2008 with 3ÿ0 win against Austria on 6 February and a 4ÿ0 win against Switzerland on 26 March.[37] Then Germany and Belarus finished in a 2ÿ2 draw.[37] Germany had a 2ÿ0 lead at halfÿtime.[38] In their final match before Euro 2008, Germany defeated Serbia 2ÿ1.[39] At Euro 2008, Germany defeated Poland 2ÿ0 in their first game, with two goals from Lukas Podolski.[40] In their second game, Germany were beaten 2ÿ1 by Croatia,[41] while in their final group game, against Austria, L?w was sent to the stands by the referee Manuel Mejuto Gonzlez ÿ along with his Austrian counterpart Josef Hickersberger ÿ for arguing with the fourth official.[42] Following his dismissal, he was seen talking to Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel about the incident. Nonetheless, Germany won the match 1ÿ0 with a goal from Michael Ballack to progress to the quarter-finals[42] as runners up because of their earlier loss to Croatia.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nL?w changed the 4ÿ4ÿ2 system after the group stages to a 4ÿ2ÿ3ÿ1 system, and left striker Mario G܇mez out of the starting lineup. Though he was forced to watch from the sidelines, his team defeated Portugal 3ÿ2.[44] In the quarter-final, L?w was banned from giving any directions to his team even through telephone calls. Later L?w declared that he had put seven different scenarios with his assistant Hansi Flick in order to contain Portugal.[45] In an exciting match against Turkey in the semi-finals, Germany won 3ÿ2.[46] Germany then lost 1ÿ0 to Spain in the final on 29 June 2008.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther progress was evident in qualifying for South Africa as Germany booked their place at the 2010 World Cup undefeated. In their penultimate match on 10 October 2009, Germany secured first place in their qualifying group for the 2010 World Cup by beating second placed Russia in Moscow 1ÿ0,[48] sending Guus Hiddink's side into playoffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2010 World Cup, L?w introduced new young players and fielded the second youngest team of the tournament, Germany's youngest since 1934. Germany topped Group D and met England in the first round of the knockout stage, beating them 4ÿ1 before defeating Argentina 4ÿ0 in the quarter-finals.[49] Germany then lost the semi-final to Spain 1ÿ0.[50] On 10 July 2010, they went on to win the third place play-off against Uruguay by 3ÿ2 to collect the bronze medals and third place at the 2010 World Cup.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany qualified for Euro 2012 and topped their group with ten wins out of ten matches. This includes a 4ÿ0 win against Kazakhstan and a 6ÿ2 win against Austria.[52] During the qualification campaign, L?w signed a new contract that would keep him with Germany until 2014.[53] Germany then proceeded to top their group in the tournament, the only team to win all three of their group matches as they defeated Portugal 1ÿ0,[54] the Netherlands 2ÿ1,[54] and Denmark 2ÿ1.[54] In the quarter-finals, Germany beat Greece 4ÿ2, but were eliminated in the semi-finals following a 2ÿ1 loss to Italy.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany started qualification with a 3ÿ0 win against the Faroe Islands.[54] Germany started 2013 with a 2ÿ1 win against France.[56] Germany started their 2014 World Cup group stage with a 4ÿ0 victory over Portugal. In the second game, against Ghana, Germany came from behind to draw the match 2ÿ2,[57] while in the third match, Germany beat the United States ÿ led by former German coach Jrgen Klinsmann ÿ 1ÿ0, with the lone goal scored by Thomas Mller. In the second round match against Algeria, L?w's tactics were called into question after playing a high defensive line allowing Algeria to break through on numerous occasions. Nonetheless, Germany won 2ÿ1 after extra time, thereby setting up a quarter-final clash with France. Germany edged France 1ÿ0.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the semi-final match, Germany defeated hosts Brazil 7ÿ1 to reach the tournament's final; the result was Brazil's worst defeat in FIFA World Cup history. L?w led Germany to their fourth World Cup title win with a 1ÿ0 victory in extra time against Argentina in the final.[58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany started Euro 2016 qualifying with a 2ÿ1 win against Scotland.[60] Then Germany lost to Poland, 2ÿ0.[61] Germany had 28 shots in the match and the result put them in fourth place.[61] Germany tied the Republic of Ireland 1ÿ1 on 14 October 2014;[62] John O'Shea had scored the equalizer for Ireland in the fourth minute of stoppage time.[62] In the following month, meanwhile, Germany defeated Gibraltar 4ÿ0.[63] On 13 March 2015, L?w signed a contract extension until 2018.[64] On 29 March 2015, Germany defeated Georgia 2ÿ0,[65] Germany remained in second place.[65] and on 10 June, in a friendly match, Germany lost 2ÿ1 to the United States.[66] This was the first victory for the U.S. in Germany.[66] Germany defeated Gibraltar 7ÿ0 on 13 June 2015[67] and Poland 3ÿ1 on 4 September 2015.[68] Three days later, Germany again defeated Scotland,[69] but on 8 October 2015, Ireland would defeat Germany 1ÿ0.[70] Germany finished off[71] qualifying with a 2ÿ1 win against Georgia.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the lead up to the final tournament, Germany faced France,[71] England,[73] Italy[73] Slovakia,[73] and Hungary.[73] France defeated Germany 2ÿ0 on 13 November 2015,[74] England defeated Germany 3ÿ2 on 26 March 2016[75] and three days later, Germany would defeat Italy 4ÿ1,[76] marking the first time since 1995 that Germany had defeated Italy.[76] Slovakia defeated Germany 3ÿ1 on 31 May 2016.[77] In their final match before the start of the tournament,[73] Germany defeated Hungary 2ÿ0.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the tournament proper, Germany were grouped into Group C alongside Ukraine, Poland and Northern Ireland.[73] Germany defeated Ukraine (2ÿ0)[79] and Northern Ireland (1ÿ0),[80] while it tied Poland (0ÿ0).[81] Finishing level on seven points with Poland but with a superior goal differential, Germany qualified for the round of 16 as Group C winners.[80] At this stage they would defeat Slovakia 3ÿ0 on 26 June 2016,[82][82] setting up a quarter-final match against Italy on 2 July.[83] After the match finished in a 1ÿ1 draw, Germany advanced to the semi-finals after winning the shootout,[83] matching up with tournament hosts France.[84] France would defeat Germany 2ÿ0, inflicting its first loss on Germany in a major tournament for the first time since 1958.[84] Despite losing, L?w thought that Germany were the \\"better team\\" in the match.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany started their 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup mission with a 3-2 victory over Australia in their first group stage match.[86] In the next match, Germany ended the match with a 1-1 draw over Chile.[87][88] Germany then won against Cameroon with a 3-1 victory in their last group stage match and sealed their place in the semi-final.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany faced Mexico in the semi-final and defeated them with a 4-1 victory to make it to the final for the first time in the tournament.[90] On 2 July 2017, L?w led Germany to their FIFA Confederations Cup title win for the first time after a 1-0 victory against Chile in the final at the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Euro 2016, L?w opted to stay on as Germany manager.[92] Germany were drawn into Group C alongside the Czech Republic, Northern Ireland, Norway, Azerbaijan and San Marino for 2018 World Cup qualifying.[93] On 15 May 2018, he extended his contract with Germany until 2022.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany lost their first group match 0ÿ1 against Mexico.[95][96] L?w played a 4-2-3-1 formation but allowed right-back, Joshua Kimmich, to attack that flank, giving Mexico space on that side. Moreover, playing two defensive midfielders but having them to push forward in attack left the German backline vulnerable to the Mexican counter.[97] Germany went on to defeat Sweden with a 2ÿ1 victory.[98] Germany were eliminated in the first round of the World Cup for the first time since 1938, and encountered its first ever group stage exit after losing 2ÿ0 to South Korea.[99][100]\\r\\n\\r\\nL?w decided to stay on as national team coach[101][102] despite the Group Stage exit from the World Cup.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nL?w has been married to Daniela since 1986; they have no children. The couple met in 1978 and dated for eight years before they got married.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nL?w lost his driver's licence twice, once in 2006 (for one month) and once in 2014 (for six months) because of his reckless behaviour behind the wheel (excessive speed and phoning).[104][105]","input":"Who is the german national soccer team coach?"},{"output":"February 26, 1919","context":"Grand Canyon National Park is the 15th site in the United States to have been named a national park. Named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, the park is located in northwestern Arizona. The park's central feature is the Grand Canyon, a gorge of the Colorado River, which is often considered one of the Wonders of the World. The park, which covers 1,217,262 acres (1,901.972?sq?mi; 492,608?ha; 4,926.08?km2) of unincorporated area in Coconino and Mohave counties, received nearly six million recreational visitors in 2016, which is the second highest count of all U.S. national parks after Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Grand Canyon\\" was officially designated a national park on February 26, 1919,[5] though the landmark had been well known to Americans for over thirty years prior.[6] In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited the site and said: \\"The Grand Canyon fills me with awe. It is beyond comparisonbeyond description; absolutely unparalleled through-out the wide world... Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is. Do nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness. You cannot improve on it. But what you can do is to keep it for your children, your children's children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight which every American should see.\\"[7]\\r\\nDespite Roosevelt's enthusiasm and strong interest in preserving land for public use, the Grand Canyon was not immediately designated as a national park. The first bill to establish Grand Canyon National Park was introduced in 1882 by then-Senator Benjamin Harrison, which would have established Grand Canyon as the second national park in the United States after Yellowstone. Harrison unsuccessfully reintroduced his bill in 1883 and 1886; after his election to the presidency, he established the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve in 1893. Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve by proclamation on 28 November 1906,[8] and the Grand Canyon National Monument in 1908.[9] Further Senate bills to establish the site as a national park were introduced and defeated in 1910 and 1911, before the Grand Canyon National Park Act was finally signed by President Woodrow Wilson in 1919. The National Park Service, established in 1916, assumed administration of the park.\\r\\nThe creation of the park was an early success of the conservation movement. Its national park status may have helped thwart proposals to dam the Colorado River within its boundaries. (Later, the Glen Canyon Dam would be built upriver.) In 1975, the former Marble Canyon National Monument, which followed the Colorado River northeast from the Grand Canyon to Lee's Ferry, was made part of Grand Canyon National Park. In 1979, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site.\\r\\nIn 2010, Grand Canyon National Park was honored with its own coin under the America the Beautiful Quarters program.[10]\\r\\nThe Grand Canyon, including its extensive system of tributary canyons, is valued for its combination of size, depth, and exposed layers of colorful rocks dating back to Precambrian times. The canyon itself was created by the incision of the Colorado River and its tributaries after the Colorado Plateau was uplifted, causing the Colorado River system to develop along its present path.\\r\\nThe primary public areas of the park are the North and South Rims of the Grand Canyon itself. The rest of the park is extremely rugged and remote, although many places are accessible by pack trail and backcountry roads. Only the Navajo Bridge near Page connects the rims by road in Arizona; this journey can take around five hours by car. Otherwise, the two rims of the Canyon are connected via the Mike O'CallaghanÿPat Tillman Memorial Bridge and the Hoover Dam.[11]\\r\\nThe park headquarters are at Grand Canyon Village, not far from the south entrance to the park, near one of the most popular viewpoints.\\r\\nThe North Rim is a smaller, more remote area with less tourist activity. It is accessed by Arizona State Route 67.[12]\\r\\nThe South Rim is more accessible than the North Rim;[13] most visitors to the park come to the South Rim, arriving on Arizona State Route 64. The highway enters the park through the South Entrance, near Tusayan, Arizona, and heads eastward, leaving the park through the East Entrance.[13] Interstate 40 provides access to the area from the south. From the north, U.S. Route 89 connects Utah, Colorado, and the North Rim to the South Rim.[14] Overall, some 30 miles of the South Rim are accessible by road.[citation needed]\\r\\nGrand Canyon Village is located at the north end of U.S. Route 180, coming from Flagstaff. It is a full-service community, including lodging, fuel, food, souvenirs, a hospital, churches, and access to trails and guided walks and talks.[11]\\r\\nSeveral lodging facilities are available along the South Rim. Hotels and other lodging include: El Tovar, Bright Angel Lodge, Kachina Lodge, Thunderbird Lodge, and Maswik Lodge, all of which are located in the village area, and Phantom Ranch, located on the canyon floor. There is also an RV Park named Trailer Village. All of these facilities are managed by Xanterra Parks & Resorts, while the Yavapai Lodge (also in the village area) is managed by Delaware North.[15]\\r\\nOn the North rim there is the historic Grand Canyon Lodge[15] managed by Forever Resorts and a campground near the lodge, managed by the National Park staff.[16]\\r\\nA variety of activities at the South Rim cater to park visitors. The South Rim Drive (35 miles (56?km) is a driving tour split into two segments. The western drive to Hermit's Point is 8 miles (13?km) with several overlooks along the way, including Mohave Point, Hopi Point, and the Powell Memorial.[11] From March to December, access to Hermit's Rest is restricted to the free shuttle provided by the Park Service. The eastern portion to Desert View is 25 miles (40?km), and is open to private vehicles year round.\\r\\nWalking tours include the Rim Trail, which runs west from the Pipe Creek viewpoint for about 8 miles (13?km) of paved road, followed by 7 miles (11?km) unpaved to Hermit's Rest. Hikes can begin almost anywhere along this trail, and a shuttle can return hikers to their point of origin. Mather Point, the first view most people reach when entering from the South Entrance, is a popular place to begin.\\r\\nPrivate canyon flyovers are provided by helicopters and small airplanes out of Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Grand Canyon National Park Airport. Due to a crash in the 1990s, scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1,500 feet (460?m) of the rim within the Grand Canyon National Park.[17] Flights within the canyon are still available outside of park boundaries.[18]\\r\\nOn the North Rim there are few roads, however, there are some notable vehicle accessible lookout points including Point Imperial, Roosevelt Point, and Cape Royal. Mule rides are also available that go to a variety of places including several thousand feet down into the canyon.\\r\\nMany visitors to the North Rim choose to make use of the variety of hiking trails including the Widforss Trail, Uncle Jim's Trail, the Transept Trail, and the North Kaibab Trail, the latter of which can be followed all the way down to the Colorado River, and to across to the South Kaibab Trail and the Bright Angel Trail, which continue up to the south rim of the Grand Canyon.\\r\\nThe Toroweap Overlook is located in the western part of the park on the North Rim. Access is via unpaved roads off Route 389 west of Fredonia, Arizona. The roads lead through Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument and to the overlook.\\r\\nThe US government had halted development of a 1.6 million acres area including the National Park from 1966 to 2009, during the Bennett Freeze, because of an ownership dispute between Hopi and Navajo.[19]\\r\\nThe Grand Canyon Association (GCA) is the National Park Service's official nonprofit partner. It raises private funds to benefit Grand Canyon National Park by operating retail shops and visitor centers within the park, and providing educational opportunities about the natural and cultural history of the region.\\r\\n1938 poster of the park\\r\\nLittle Colorado River\\r\\nColorado River from the South Rim\\r\\nA rockfall from the North Rim\\r\\nFrom the South Rim in winter\\r\\nAmerica The Beautiful Quarter","input":"When was the grand canyon national park founded?"},{"output":"Bob Seger","context":"\\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" is a song written by George Jackson and recorded by Bob Seger on his 1978 album Stranger in Town. It was also released as a single in 1979. It is a sentimentalized look back at the music of the original rock 'n' roll era. The song gained substantial popularity after being featured in the 1983 film Risky Business. It has since become a standard in popular music and was ranked number two on the Amusement & Music Operators Association's survey of the Top 40 Jukebox Singles of All Time in 1996.[1] It was also listed as one of the Songs of the Century in 2001 and ranked #100 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs poll in 2004 of the top songs in American cinema. The song was recorded at the Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Sheffield, Alabama and Sound Suite Studios[2] in Detroit, Michigan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, who often backed Seger in his studio recordings, sent Seger a demo of the song during the recording of Stranger in Town.[3] He said in 2006 (and also on the \\"Stranger in Town\\" episode of the US radio show In the Studio with Redbeard a few years earlier):\\r\\nAll I kept from the original was: \\"Old time rock and roll, that kind of music just soothes the soul, I reminisce about the days of old with that old time rock and roll\\". I rewrote the verses and I never took credit. That was the dumbest thing I ever did. And Tom Jones (Thomas E. Jones) and George Jackson know it, too. But I just wanted to finish the record [Stranger in Town]. I rewrote every verse you hear except for the choruses. I didn't ask for credit. My manager said: \\"You should ask for a third of the credit.\\" And I said: \\"Nah. Nobody's gonna like it.\\" I'm not credited on it so I couldn't control the copyright either. Meanwhile it got into a Hardee's commercial because I couldn't control it. Oh my God, it was awful!\\"[4]\\r\\nHowever, George Stephenson of Malaco Records claimed:\\r\\n\\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" is truly [George] Jackson's song, and he has the tapes to prove it, despite Seger's claims that he altered it. Bob had pretty much finished his recording at Muscle Shoals and he asked them if they had any other songs he could listen to for the future..\\"[5]\\r\\nOriginally, the Silver Bullet Band was displeased with its inclusion on Stranger in Town, claiming, according to Seger, that the song was not \\"Silver Bullety\\". However, upon hearing audience reactions to it during their tour in Europe, the band grew to like the song.[6]\\r\\nIn 1990, Seger joined Billy Joel on one occasion and Don Henley on another to play the song during their concerts in Auburn Hills, Michigan.[7] He also performed the song at his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony.\\r\\nThe song was featured in the 1983 film Risky Business, starring Tom Cruise. Cruise's character, Joel Goodson, famously lip-syncs and dances in his underwear as this song plays after his parents leave him home alone. The sequence was simulated in the teaser trailer for Garfield: The Movie, the 1984 Alvin and the Chipmunks episode \\"The Victrola Awards\\" as performed by Alvin and the Chipmunks, and commercials for Guitar Hero on Tour: Decades, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica, and more recently Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero. Activision created a series of television advertisements directed by Brett Ratner based on the scene, each featuring a different set of celebrities lip-sync to the lyrics while using the new instrument controllers. The first ad included athletes Kobe Bryant, Tony Hawk, Alex Rodriguez, and Michael Phelps.[8] Another ad spot featured model Heidi Klum; two versions of Klum's ad exist, one a \\"director's cut\\" where she is wearing less clothing.[9] A subsequent commercial featuring model Marisa Miller was banned from airing as too racy.[10] Two separate ads featured David Cook, the winner of the seventh season of American Idol, along with fellow finalist David Archuleta.\\r\\nThe song was featured in the TV series ALF, The Nanny, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, Growing Pains, Scrubs, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air and South Park. Most recently, the song was sung on the episode \\"Girls (And Boys) On Film\\" from American TV series Glee, in a mash-up with Kenny Loggins' song \\"Danger Zone\\" from the 1986 film Top Gun, also starring Cruise and The Goldbergs, where Barry Goldberg tries to do the Risky Business dance move that Tom Cruise did in his button up shirt without pants.\\r\\nAmerican Singer and actress Cher did a cover on the song during her 2008-2011 residency show, Cher (2008ÿ2011).\\r\\nIn a running gag called \\"Hot Sax\\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (and before that Late Night with Jimmy Fallon), the host, sidekick and house band take turns miming the song's saxophone solo while a recording of it is played.\\r\\nThe South African trio Mark Haze (from Idols South Africa season seven), Dozi and Ghapi recorded a version on their album Rocking Buddies in 2013.[11]\\r\\nIn 2014, on the opening night of Mexico Tiene Talento (Mexico Got Talent), Pablo Lopez, a homeless man who sings on the Mexico City subway system, debuted at the auditions with a rendition in a nearly identical voice to that of Seger; causing a total amusement and a golden button for the next stage.[12]\\r\\n\\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" achieved substantial album-oriented rock radio airplay and as the fourth single from Stranger in Town, it reached number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1979. It was re-released in 1983 after its inclusion in the film Risky Business and reached number 48 on the Billboard chart.[13] The song remains a staple on classic rock radio.\\r\\nIn Australia, the song was released twice and charted for a total of 55 weeks. The first run was in 1983 after its use in the film Risky Business, reaching number 53 on the charts. The second run saw it reach #3 in late 1987.\\r\\nIn 2000 the british rock band Status Quo recorded a version of this song on their album Famous in the Last Century. They played it at Top of the Pops and published it as a single which charted in UK and Norway.","input":"Who sings old time rock and roll song?"},{"output":"American Revolution","context":"This is a

phase that occurs when the aircraft levels after a climb to a set altitude and before it begins to descend. [1]\\r\\nCruising usually consumes the majority of a flight, and it may include changes in heading (direction of flight) at a constant airspeed and altitude.\\r\\nFor most passenger aircraft, the cruise phase consumes most of the aircraft's fuel. This lightens the aircraft and raises the optimum altitude for fuel economy. For traffic control reasons it is usually necessary for an aircraft to stay at the cleared flight level.

It is unique among the ancient pre-ecumenical councils in that it is considered by Catholics and Orthodox to be a prototype and forerunner of the later ecumenical councils and a key part of Christian ethics. The council decided that Gentile converts to Christianity were not obligated to keep most of the Law of Moses, including the rules concerning circumcision of males. The Council did, however, retain the prohibitions on eating blood, meat containing blood, and meat of animals not properly slain, and on fornication and idolatry, sometimes referred to as the Apostolic Decree or Jerusalem Quadrilateral.\\r\\nAccounts of the council are found in Acts of the Apostles chapter 15 (in two different forms, the Alexandrian and Western versions) and also possibly in Paul's letter to the Galatians chapter 2.[1] Some scholars dispute that Galatians 2 is about the Council of Jerusalem (notably because Galatians 2 describes a private meeting) while other scholars dispute the historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Council of Jerusalem is generally dated to 48 AD, roughly 15 to 25 years after the crucifixion of Jesus, between 26 and 36 AD. Acts 15 and Galatians 2 both suggest that the meeting was called to debate whether or not male Gentiles who were converting to become followers of Jesus were required to become circumcised; circumcision was considered repulsive during the period of Hellenization of the Eastern Mediterranean.[2]\\r\\nAt the time, most followers of Jesus (which historians refer to as Jewish Christians) were Jewish by birth and even converts would have considered the early Christians as a part of Judaism. According to Alister McGrath, the Jewish Christians affirmed every aspect of the then contemporary Second Temple Judaism with the addition of the belief that Jesus was the Messiah.[3] Unless males were circumcised, they could not be God's People. The meeting was called to decide whether circumcision for gentile converts was requisite for community membership since certain individuals were teaching that \\"[u]nless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved\\".[4]\\r\\nCircumcision as a mandate was associated with Abraham (see also Abrahamic covenant), but it is cited as \\"the custom of Moses\\" because Moses is considered the traditional giver of the Law as a whole. The circumcision mandate was made more official and binding in the Mosaic Law Covenant. In John 7:22 the words of Jesus are reported to be that Moses gave the people circumcision.\\r\\nThe purpose of the meeting, according to Acts, was to resolve a disagreement in Antioch, which had wider implications than just circumcision, since circumcision is the \\"everlasting\\" sign of the Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 17:9ÿ14). Some of the Pharisees who had become believers insisted that it was \\"needful to circumcise them, and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses\\" (KJV).[5]\\r\\nThe primary issue which was addressed related to the requirement of circumcision, as the author of Acts relates, but other important matters arose as well, as the Apostolic Decree indicates. The dispute was between those, such as the followers of the \\"Pillars of the Church\\", led by James, who believed, following his interpretation of the Great Commission, that the church must observe the Torah, i.e. the rules of traditional Judaism,[1] and Paul the Apostle, who believed there was no such necessity. (See also Supersessionism, New Covenant, Antinomianism, Hellenistic Judaism, Paul the Apostle and Judaism.)\\r\\nAt the Council, following advice offered by Simon Peter (Acts 15:7ÿ11 and Acts 15:14), Barnabas and Paul gave an account of their ministry among the gentiles (Acts 15:12), and the apostle James quoted from the words of the prophet Amos (Acts 15:16ÿ17, quoting Amos 9:11ÿ12). James added his own words[6] to the quotation: \\"Known to God from eternity are all His works\\"[7] and then submitted a proposal, which was accepted by the Church and became known as the Apostolic Decree:\\r\\nIt is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood.[2] For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath. (Acts 15:19ÿ21)\\r\\nActs 15:23ÿ29 sets out the content of the letter written in accordance with James' proposal.\\r\\nThe Western version of Acts (see Acts of the Apostles: Manuscripts) adds the negative form of the Golden Rule (\\"and whatever things ye would not have done to yourselves, do not do to another\\").[3]\\r\\nThis determined questions wider than that of circumcision, particularly dietary questions, but also fornication and idolatry and blood, and also the application of Biblical law to non-Jews. It was stated by the Apostles and Elders in the Council: \\"the Holy Spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you, except these necessary things, to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper.\\" (Acts 15:27ÿ28) And this Apostolic Decree was considered binding on all the other local Christian congregations in other regions.[8] See also Biblical law directed at non-Jews, Seven Laws of Noah, Biblical law in Christianity, and the Ten Commandments in Christianity.\\r\\nThe writer of Acts gives an account of a restatement by James and the elders in Jerusalem of the contents of the letter on the occasion of Paul's final Jerusalem visit, immediately prior to Paul's arrest at the temple, recounting: \\"When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.\\" (Acts 21:17ÿ18, ESV) The elders then proceed to notify Paul of what seems to have been a common concern among Jewish believers, that he was teaching Diaspora Jewish converts to Christianity \\"to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs.\\" They remind the assembly that, \\"as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality\\". In the view of some scholars, the reminder of James and the elders here is an expression of concern that Paul was not fully teaching the decision of the Jerusalem Council's letter to Gentiles,[9] particularly in regard to non-strangled kosher meat,[10] which contrasts with Paul's advice to Gentiles in Corinth,[11] to \\"eat whatever is sold in the meat markets\\" (1 Corinthians 10:25).[12]\\r\\nThe description of the Apostolic Council in Acts 15, generally considered the same event described in Galatians 2,[13] is considered by some scholars to be contradictory to the Galatians account.[14] The historicity of Luke's account has been challenged,[15][16][17] and was rejected completely by some scholars in the mid to late 20th century.[18] However, more recent scholarship inclines towards treating the Jerusalem Council and its rulings as a historical event,[19] though this is sometimes expressed with caution.[20] Bruce Metzger's Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament includes a summary of current research on the topic as of about 1994:\\r\\nIn conclusion, therefore, it appears that the least unsatisfactory solution of the complicated textual and exegetical problems of the Apostolic Decree is to regard the fourfold decree[21] as original (foods offered to idols, strangled meat, eating blood, and unchastitywhether ritual or moral), and to explain the two forms of the threefold decree[21] in some such way as those suggested above.[22] An extensive literature exists on the text and exegesis of the Apostolic Decree. ... According to Jacques Dupont, \\"Present day scholarship is practically unanimous in considering the 'Eastern' text of the decree as the only authentic text (in four items) and in interpreting its prescriptions in a sense not ethical but ritual\\" [Les problmes du Livre des Actes d'aprs les travaux rcents (Louvain, 1950), p.70].[23]\\r\\nJames's Apostolic Decree was that most Mosaic law,[24] including the requirement for circumcision of males, was not obligatory for Gentile converts, possibly in order to make it easier for them to join the movement.[4] However, the Council did retain the prohibitions against Gentile converts eating meat containing blood, or meat of animals not properly slain. It also retained the prohibitions against \\"fornication\\" and \\"idol worship\\". See also Old Testament Law directed at non-Jews. In effect, the Jerusalem Church created a flexible approach which some accuse of being a double-standard: one for Jewish Christians and one for Gentile converts (for the parallel in Judaism, see Convert to Judaism and Noahides). The Decree may be a major act of differentiation of the Church from its Jewish roots,[25] depending on when Jewish Noahide law was developed.[26] Around the same time period, the authorities of Rabbinic Judaism made their circumcision requirement even stricter.[27][full citation needed] The decision created a category of persons who were members of the Christian community (which still considered itself to be part of the Jewish community) who, in certain situations, would be unacceptable to the wider Jewish community, because they were uncircumcised, besides other objections relating to the 613 mitzvot. On the other hand, some in the early Church did not take long to decide that the Torah requirements were not necessary for Jewish converts either (see the Epistle to the Hebrews, and Justin Martyr's Dialog with Trypho[28] and Marcionism; Paul also repeatedly states that Jews and Gentiles are one in Christ, which may be interpreted as saying that they are not distinguished in any way, including their relationship to the Mosaic Law, but this is just one interpretation and the issues of Paul the Apostle and Judaism and interpretation of Pauline passages supporting antinomianism and Pauline passages opposing antinomianism are still widely disputed. See also Criticism of Dual-Covenant theology).\\r\\nDetermining what followed depends on how reliable one believes the various texts to be. Some scholars have taken a very skeptical view of the probity of Acts.[5] Moreover, Paul seems to have refused \\"to be tied down to particular patterns of behavior and practice\\".[6] For example, see 1 Corinthians 9:20ÿ23. He does not engage in a dispute with those Corinthians who apparently feel quite free to eat anything offered to idols, never appealing or even mentioning the Jerusalem council. He rather attempts to persuade them by appealing to the care they should have for other believers who might not feel so free.\\r\\nThe question of the relationship with Jews and Jewish Christians continued for some time, indeed it is still debated today.\\r\\nJewish Encyclopedia: New Testament  Spirit of Jewish Proselytism in Christianity states:\\r\\nFor great as was the success of Barnabas and Paul in the heathen world, the authorities in Jerusalem insisted upon circumcision as the condition of admission of members into the church, until, on the initiative of Peter, and of James, the head of the Jerusalem church, it was agreed that acceptance of the Noachian Lawsnamely, regarding avoidance of idolatry, fornication, and the eating of flesh cut from a living animalshould be demanded of the heathen desirous of entering the Church.\\r\\nJewish Encyclopedia: Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah states:\\r\\nR. Emden, in a remarkable apology for Christianity contained in his appendix to \\"Seder 'Olam\\" (pp. 32b-34b, Hamburg, 1752), gives it as his opinion that the original intention of Jesus, and especially of Paul, was to convert only the Gentiles to the seven moral laws of Noah and to let the Jews follow the Mosaic lawwhich explains the apparent contradictions in the New Testament regarding the laws of Moses and the Sabbath.\\r\\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia article on Judaizers states:\\r\\nPaul, on the other hand, not only did not object to the observance of the Mosaic Law, as long as it did not interfere with the liberty of the Gentiles, but he conformed to its prescriptions when occasion required (1Corinthians 9:20). Thus he shortly after circumcised Timothy (Acts 16:1ÿ3), and he was in the very act of observing the Mosaic ritual when he was arrested at Jerusalem (Acts 21:26 sqq.)\\r\\nJoseph Fitzmyer[29] disputes the claim that the Apostolic Decree is based on Noahide Law (Gen 9) and instead proposes Lev 17ÿ18 as the basis, see also Leviticus 18. He also argues that the decision was meant as a practical compromise to help Jewish and Gentile Christians to get along, not a theological statement intended to bind Christians for all time.\\r\\nAccording to the 19th-century Roman Catholic Bishop Karl Josef von Hefele, the Apostolic Decree of the Jerusalem Council \\"has been obsolete for centuries in the West\\", though it is still recognized and observed by the Greek Orthodox Church.[30] Acts 28 Hyperdispensationalists, such as the 20th century Anglican E. W. Bullinger, would be another example of a group that believes the decree (and everything before Acts 28) no longer applies.\\r\\nMost Christians consider circumcision to be only an optional ritual[citation needed], but Orthodox Judaism considers it one of the mandatory 613 mitzvot, following Genesis 17:10ÿ27, and the signature-law (or eternal sign) by which men signed the covenant with God, in blood, and thereby became a People of God, subject to God's protection and curse. This, according to the Torah, was the way that Abraham signed the covenant with God and thereby started Judaism, see also Abrahamic religions#Circumcision. In the 1st century AD, modern anesthesia and antibiotics did not exist and the death-rates were high from even minor medical operations[citation needed]. Demanding a Gentile adult male be circumcised in order to become a follower of Jesus, may not only have been terrifying, but it may have been life-threatening.[original research?] This is the reason why this Council was called by Jesus' apostle James[citation needed], who, according to Paul's account in Galatians 2:10 concluded that Paul would not have to demand his men to become circumcised, and according to Luke's account in Acts 15:13ÿ21, James not only permitted uncircumcised men to remain in the group, but he said in closing the Council (Acts 15:19) \\"We should not trouble the Gentiles who are turning to God.\\"\\r\\nAs for Orthodox Judaism today, the rabbis do not believe that Gentiles need to be circumcised, unless they wish to convert to Judaism, which is discouraged. Instead, Gentiles need only follow the Seven Laws of Noah to be assured of a place in the \\"World to Come\\".","input":"What was the outcome of the jerusalem council?"},{"output":"Milan Central","context":"Milan Central or Milano Centrale is the main railway station of the city of Milan, Italy and one of the main railway stations in Europe.

There are currently 49 such countries, including five partially recognised states. Only two, Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, lie outside Afro-Eurasia (the Old World).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a rule, being landlocked creates political and economic handicaps that access to the high seas avoids. For this reason, states large and small across history have striven to gain access to open waters, even at great expense in wealth, bloodshed, and political capital.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic disadvantages of being landlocked can be alleviated or aggravated depending on degree of development, language barriers, and other considerations. Some landlocked countries are quite affluent, such as Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Austria, all of which frequently employ neutrality to their political advantage.  The majority, however, are classified as Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs).[2] Nine of the twelve countries with the lowest Human Development Indices (HDI) are landlocked.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, being landlocked has been disadvantageous to a country's development. It cuts a nation off from important sea resources such as fishing, and impedes or prevents direct access to seaborne trade, a crucial component of economic and social advance.  As such, coastal regions tended to be wealthier and more heavily populated than inland ones. Paul Collier in his book The Bottom Billion argues that being landlocked in a poor geographic neighborhood is one of four major development \\"traps\\" by which a country can be held back. In general, he found that when a neighboring country experiences better growth, it tends to spill over into favorable development for the country itself. For landlocked countries, the effect is particularly strong, as they are limited in their trading activity with the rest of the world. He states, \\"If you are coastal, you serve the world; if you are landlocked, you serve your neighbors.\\"[4] Others have argued that being landlocked may actually be a blessing as it creates a \\"natural tariff barrier\\" which protects the country from cheap imports. In some instances, this has led to more robust local food systems.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlocked developing countries have significantly higher costs of international cargo transportation compared to coastal developing countries (in Asia the ratio is 3:1).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nCountries thus have made particular efforts to avoid being landlocked, by acquiring land that reaches the sea:\\r\\n\\r\\nCountries can make agreements on getting free transport of goods through neighbour countries:\\r\\n\\r\\nLosing access to the sea is generally a great blow to a nation, politically, militarily, and economically. The following are examples of countries becoming landlocked. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea now gives a landlocked country a right of access to and from the sea without taxation of traffic through transit states. The United Nations has a programme of action to assist landlocked developing countries,[10] and the current responsible Undersecretary-General is Anwarul Karim Chowdhury.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome countries have a long coastline, but much of it may not be readily usable for trade and commerce. For instance, in its early history, Russia's only ports were on the Arctic Ocean and frozen shut for much of the year. The wish to gain control of a warm-water port was a major motivator of Russian expansion towards the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Pacific Ocean. On the other hand, some landlocked countries can have access to the ocean along wide navigable rivers. For instance, Paraguay (and Bolivia to a lesser extent) have access to the ocean by the Paraguay and Parana rivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral countries have coastlines on landlocked seas, such as the Caspian and the Dead. Since these seas are in effect lakes without access to wider seaborne trade, countries such as Kazakhstan are still considered landlocked. Although the Caspian Sea is connected to the Black Sea via the man-made VolgaÿDon Canal, large oceangoing ships are unable to traverse it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlocked countries may be bordered by a single country having direct access to the high seas, two or more such countries, or be surrounded by other landlocked countries, making a country doubly landlocked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree countries are landlocked by a single country (enclaved countries):\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven landlocked countries are surrounded by only two mutually bordering neighbours (semi-enclaved countries):\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this group could be added three de facto states with no or limited international recognition:\\r\\n\\r\\nA country is \\"doubly landlocked\\" or \\"double-landlocked\\" when it is surrounded entirely by one or more landlocked countries (requiring the crossing of at least two national borders to reach a coastline).[11][12] There are two such countries:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no doubly landlocked countries from the unification of Germany in 1871 until the end of World War I. Liechtenstein bordered the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which had an Adriatic coastline, and Uzbekistan was then part of the Russian Empire, which had both ocean and sea access.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918 and creation of an independent, landlocked Austria, Liechtenstein became the sole doubly landlocked country until 1938. In the Nazi Anschluss that year, Austria was absorbed into the Third Reich, which possessed a border on the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. After World War II, Austria regained its independence and Liechtenstein once again became doubly landlocked. \\r\\n\\r\\nUzbekistan, which had been absorbed by the Soviet Union upon the toppling of the Russian throne in 1917, gained its independence with the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. in 1991 and became the second doubly landlocked country.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Uzbekistan's doubly landlocked status depends on the Caspian Sea's status dispute: some countries, especially Iran and Turkmenistan, claim that the Caspian Sea should be considered as a real sea (mainly because this way they would have larger oil and gas fields), which would make Uzbekistan only a simple landlocked country because its neighbours Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan have access to the Caspian Sea.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey can be grouped in contiguous groups as follows:[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Transnistria is included then Moldova and Transnistria form their own cluster, listed in parentheses in the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it were not for the 40?km (25?mi) of coastline at Muanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo would join the two African clusters into one, making them the biggest contiguous group in the world. Also, the Central Asian and Caucasian clusters can be considered contiguous, joined by the landlocked Caspian Sea. Mongolia is almost part of this cluster too, being separated from Kazakhstan by only 30?km (19?mi), across Russian or Chinese territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are the following \\"single\\" landlocked countries (each of them borders no other landlocked country):\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Caucasian countries and Kazakhstan are counted as part of Europe, then Europe has the most landlocked countries, at 20. If these transcontinental countries are included in Asia, then Africa has the most, at 16. Depending on the status of the three transcontinental countries, Asia has between 9 and 15, while South America has only 2. North America and Australia are the only continents with no landlocked countries (not including Antarctica, which has no countries).","input":"What are south americas only 2 landlocked countries?"},{"output":"Emmeline Pankhurst","context":"The Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) was a women-only political movement and leading militant organisation campaigning for women's suffrage in the United Kingdom from 1903 to 1917. Known from 1906 as the suffragettes, its membership and policies were tightly controlled by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Christabel and Sylvia (although Sylvia was eventually expelled).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe WSPU membership became known for civil disobedience and direct action. It heckled politicians, held demonstrations and marches, broke the law to force arrests, broke windows in prominent buildings, set fire to post boxes, committed night-time arson of unoccupied houses and churches, andwhen imprisonedwent on hunger strike and endured force-feeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Women's Social and Political Union was founded as an independent women's movement on 10 October 1903 at 62 Nelson Street, Manchester, home of the Pankhurst family.[1] Emmeline Pankhurst, along with two of her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia, and her husband, Richard, before his death in 1898, had been active in the Independent Labour Party (ILP), founded in 1893 by Keir Hardie, a family friend.[2] (Hardie later founded the Labour Party.)\\r\\n\\r\\nEmmeline Pankhurst had increasing felt that the ILP was not there for women.[2] On 9 October 1903 she invited a group of ILP women to meet at her home the next day, telling them: \\"Women, we must do the work ourselves. We must have an independent women's movement. Come to my house tomorrow and we will arrange it!\\"[3] Membership of the WSPU was open to women only, and it had no party affiliation.[2] In January 1906 the Daily Mailwhich supported women's suffragedescribed the WSPU for the first time as suffragettes, a term they embraced.[a]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1905 the group convinced the Member of Parliament Bamford Slack to introduce a women's suffrage bill, which was ultimately talked out, but the publicity spurred rapid expansion of the group. The WSPU changed tactics following the failure of the bill; they focused on attacking whichever political party was in government and refused to support any legislation which did not include enfranchisement for women. This translated into abandoning their initial commitment to also supporting immediate social reforms.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1906 the group began a series of demonstrations and lobbies of Parliament, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of growing numbers of their members. An attempt to achieve equal franchise gained national attention when an envoy of 300 women, representing over 125,000?suffragettes, argued for women's suffrage with the Prime Minister, Sir?Henry Campbell-Bannerman. The Prime Minister agreed with their argument but \\"was obliged to do nothing at all about it\\" and so urged the women to \\"go on pestering\\" and to exercise \\"the virtue of patience\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the women Campbell-Bannerman advised to be patient had been working for women's rights for as many as fifty years: his advice to \\"go on pestering\\" would prove quite unwise. His thoughtless words infuriated the protesters and \\"by those foolish words the militant movement became irrevocably established, and the stage of revolt began\\".[6] In 1907 the organisation held the first of several of their \\"Women's Parliaments\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Labour Party then voted to support universal suffrage. This split them from the WSPU, which had always accepted the property qualifications which already applied to women's participation in local elections. Under Christabel's direction, the group began to more explicitly organise exclusively among middle class women, and stated their opposition to all political parties. This led a small group of prominent members to leave and form the Women's Freedom League.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately following the WSPU/WFL split, in autumn?1907, Frederick and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence founded the WSPU's own newspaper, Votes for Women. The Pethick Lawrences, who were part of the leadership of the WSPU until 1912, edited the newspaper and supported it financially in the early years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1908 the WSPU adopted purple, white, and green as its official colours. These colours were chosen by Emmeline Pethick Lawrence because \\"Purple...stands for the royal blood that flows in the veins of every suffragette...white stands for purity in private and public life...green is the colour of hope and the emblem of spring\\".[7] June?1908 saw the first major public use of these colours when the WSPU held a 300,000-strong \\"Women's Sunday\\" rally in Hyde Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February?1907 the WSPU founded the Woman's Press, which oversaw publishing and propaganda for the organisation, and marketed a range of products from 1908 featuring the WSPU's name or colours. The woman's Press in London and WSPU chains throughout the UK operated stores selling WSPU products.[8] A board game named Suffragetto was published circa 1908. Until January?1911, the WSPU's official anthem was \\"The Women's Marseillaise\\",[9] a setting of words by Florence Macaulay to the tune of \\"La Marseillaise\\".[10] In that month the anthem was changed to \\"The March of the Women\\",[9] newly composed by Ethel Smyth with words by Cicely Hamilton.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn opposition to the continuing and repeated imprisonment of many of their members, the WSPU introduced the prison hunger strike to Britain, and the authorities' policy of force feeding won the suffragettes great sympathy from the public. The government later passed the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act?1913 (more commonly known as the \\"Cat and Mouse Act\\"), which allowed the release of suffragettes who were close to death due to malnourishment. Officers, however, could re-imprison them again once they were healthy. This was an attempt to avoid force-feeding.[5] In response, the WSPU organised an all-women security team known as the Bodyguard, trained by Edith Margaret Garrud and led by Gertrude Harding, whose role was to protect fugitive suffragettes from re-imprisonment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new suffrage bill was introduced in 1910, but growing impatient, the WSPU launched a heightened campaign of protest in 1912 on the basis of targeting property and avoiding violence against any person. Initially this involved smashing shop windows, but ultimately escalated to burning stately homes and bombing public buildings including Westminster Abbey. It also famously led to the death of IDK Emily Davison as she was trampled by the King's horse, Anmer, (over which she was attempting to drape a suffragette banner) at The Derby in 1913.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncluded in the many militant acts performed were the night-time arson of unoccupied houses (including that of Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George) and churches. Suffragettes smashed windows of upscale shops and government offices. They cut telephone lines, spat at police and politicians, cut or burned pro-suffrage slogans into stadium turf,[12] sent letter bombs, destroyed greenhouses at Kew gardens, chained themselves to railings and blew up houses. A doctor was attacked with a rhino whip, and in one case suffragettes rushed the House of Commons. On 18?July?1912, Mary Leigh threw a hatchet at Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the evening of 9 March 1914, about 40 militant suffragettes, including members of the Bodyguard team, brawled with several squads of police constables who were attempting to re-arrest Emmeline Pankhurst during a pro-suffrage rally at St. Andrew's Hall in Glasgow. The following day, suffragette Mary Richardson (known as one of the most militant activists, also called \\"Slasher\\" Richardson) walked into the National Gallery and attacked Diego Velzquez's painting, Rokeby Venus with a meat cleaver. In 1913 suffragette militancy caused S54,000 worth of damage, S36,000 of which occurred in April alone.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe organisation also suffered divisions. The editors of Votes for Women, Frederick and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence, were expelled in 1912, later founding the United Suffragists.  This caused the WSPU to launch a new journal, The Suffragette, edited by Christabel Pankhurst. The East London Federation of mostly working-class women and led by Sylvia Pankhurst was expelled in 1914.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Christabel Pankhurst was living in Paris, in order to run the organisation without fear of arrest. Her autocratic control enabled her, over the objections of Kitty Marion and others,[12] to declare soon after war broke out that the WSPU should abandon its campaigns in favour of a nationalistic stance, supporting the British government in the war. The WSPU stopped publishing The Suffragette, and in April?1915 it launched a new journal, Britannia. While the majority of WSPU members supported the war, a small number formed the Suffragettes of the Women's Social Political Union (SWSPU) and the Independent Women's Social and Political Union (IWSPU). The WSPU faded from public attention and was dissolved in 1917, with Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst founding the Women's Party.[5]","input":"Who founded the women's social and political union?"},{"output":"Ed, Edd n Eddy","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nEd, Edd n Eddy is a Canadian-American animated comedy television series created by Danny Antonucci for Cartoon Network, and the sixth of the network's Cartoon Cartoons. The series revolves around three preteen boys named Ed, Edd (called \\"Double D\\" to avoid confusion with Ed), and Eddycollectively known as \\"the Eds\\"who live in a suburban cul-de-sac in the fictional town of Peach Creek. Under the unofficial leadership of Eddy, the trio frequently invent schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favorite confectionery, jawbreakers. Their plans usually fail, leaving them in various, often humiliating, predicaments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdult cartoonist Antonucci was dared to create a children's cartoon; while designing a commercial, he conceived Ed, Edd n Eddy, designing it to resemble classic cartoons from the 1940sÿ1970s. He pitched the series to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, but the latter demanded creative control, leading to him making a deal with the former and the series premiering on January 4, 1999. During the show's run, several specials and shorts were produced in addition to the regular television series. The series concluded with a TV movie, Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, on November 8, 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nEd, Edd n Eddy received generally positive reviews from critics and became one of Cartoon Network's most successful original series. It won a Reuben Award, two Leo Awards and a SOCAN Award, and was also nominated for another four Leo Awards, an Annie Award and two Kids' Choice Awards. The show attracted an audience of 31 million households, was broadcast in 120 countries, and proved to be popular among children, teenagers, and adults. With a 10-year run, Ed, Edd n Eddy was the longest-running Cartoon Network original series at the time of its end.\\r\\n\\r\\nEd, Edd n Eddy follows the lives of \\"the Eds\\", three preteen boys who all share variations of the name Ed, but differ greatly in their personalities: Ed (voiced by Matt Hill) is the strong, dim-witted dogsbody of the group; Edd (Samuel Vincent), called Double D, is an inventor, neat freak, and the most intelligent of the Eds; and Eddy (Tony Sampson) is a devious, quick-tempered, bitter con artist, and self-appointed leader of the Eds. The three devise plans to scam the cul-de-sac kids out of their money, which they want to use to buy jawbreakers. However, problems always ensue, and the Eds' schemes usually end in failure and humiliation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cul-de-sac kids do not include the Eds as part of their group, making the trio outcasts. The group of kids consist of: Jonny 2G4 (David Paul \\"Buck\\" Grove) is a loner whom his peers consider to be a nuisance, and spends most of his time with his imaginary friend, a wooden board named Plank; Jimmy (Keenan Christensen) is a weak, insecure, and innocent yet accident-prone child, who is most often seen spending his time with Sarah (Janyse Jaud), Ed's spoiled and ill-tempered younger sister; Rolf (Peter Kelamis) is an immigrant, who often participates in unconventional customs; Kevin (Kathleen Barr) is a cynical and sardonic jock who detests the Eds, particularly Eddy; Nazz (Tabitha St. Germain; Jenn Forgie; Erin Fitzgerald), usually seen with Kevin, is a stereotypical dumb blonde and an unattainable love interest for the cul-de-sac kids. All of the cul-de-sac kids share a common fear of the Kanker Sisters, Lee (Janyse Jaud), May (Erin Fitzgerald; Jenn Forgie), and Marie (Kathleen Barr), three teenage girls who live in a nearby trailer park and are in love with the Eds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from the Eds, the other cul-de-sac kids, and the Kanker Sisters, no other characters appeared in the series until the fifth season, when the silhouettes of other people were occasionally shown, and in \\"Mission Ed-Possible\\", the arms of Eddy's father and Ed's mother were seen. In the series finale, Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, Eddy's adult brother (Terry Klassen) was seen for the first time, making him the only non-main character, and the only adult character to ever fully appear on the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series took place mostly within the fictional town of Peach Creek, and new locations were rarely introduced. The first four seasons of the show are set during a seemingly endless summer vacation, though from the fifth season onwards, the characters are shown attending junior high school in the fall and winter months.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough cartoonist Danny Antonucci began his career by working as an animator on various children's series for Hanna-Barbera, his later solo works were edgy and aimed at adult audiences. He gained notoriety with the 1987 short film Lupo the Butcher and then, after founding his own production studio, a.k.a. Cartoon in 1994, created the series The Brothers Grunt for MTV. It was quickly cancelled, however, upon being met with generally poor reviews.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a dare, Antonucci then decided that he would try producing a children's animated series of his own. While designing a commercial, he ended up drawing three characters that he felt particularly pleased with. Growing excited over their potential, he named them Ed, Edd, and Eddy and spent the following months developing a show around them.[3] He faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon in 1996.[3][4] Both studios quickly responded, Cartoon Network in only 20 minutes, and were enthusiastic and wanted to see more; they each demanded creative control, however, and Antonucci refused.[1] After Cartoon Network agreed to let Antonucci have control of the show, conversations between Antonucci and the studio continued.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nVice president of programming and production of Cartoon Network, Mike Lazzo, showed high interest in the series and requested a show bible, which came through by fax, a few pages at a time, over a period of the next few months.[4] After an affirmative response from Cartoon Network president Betty Cohen, the legal paperwork and deal-making began, followed by a start-up meeting at the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles. A deal was made that Antonucci's studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce Ed, Edd n Eddy, the first Cartoon Network original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Cartoon Network's Hanna-Barbera. The series also entered production and bypassed a seven-minute short; this marked the first time that one of the studio's original series had ever done this.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Antonucci, he based the characters on real people in his life. The personalities of Ed, Double D, and Eddy are based on his own traits as well as the activities of his two sons, while the cul-de-sac children and the Kanker sisters were all based on children he grew up with.[5] Rolf is based on Antonucci and his cousins, since he was part of an Italian immigrant family, and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living, compared to those born in Canada.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nRolf is me and all of my cousins. My parents were right off the boat so I grew up playing to two worlds, the modern world and the 1950s Italian world. My parents like Rolf's lived? still live in the past, with strong traditions and strange cooking and having a hard time assimilating to modern life.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n Jimmy is based on one of his cousins, who was rather feminine and spent most of his time playing with girls rather than with boys.[3] Jonny and Plank are inspired by one of Antonucci's childhood friends, a loner who spent most of his time outside with his blanket.[3] He stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, and that he \\"thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own\\" and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do.[5] Some wanted Plank to be able to talk, smile and blink as if he was alive, but Antonucci insisted that it should be treated as a piece of wood, brought to life by Jonny's imagination.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMatt Hill, Samuel Vincent, and Tony Sampson were respectively cast as Ed, Double D, and Eddy. David Paul \\"Buck\\" Grove and Keenan Christensen played the parts of Jonny 2G4 and Jimmy, respectively, while Sarah was voiced by Janyse Jaud. Peter Kelamis voiced Rolf, while Kathleen Barr was cast as Kevin. Nazz was voiced by Tabitha St. Germain in season 1, Jenn Forgie in season 3 and Erin Fitzgerald in seasons 2, 4, 5 and 6. Fitzgerald also played the part of May, one of the Kanker Sisters, except in season 3 when she was voiced by Jenn Forgie. The other two Kanker sisters, Marie and Lee, were voiced by Kathleen Barr and Janyse Jaud. Eddy's adult brother is mentioned frequently throughout the series but does not appear until Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, where he is voiced by series voice director Terry Klassen.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAntonucci, an advocate of hand-drawn animation, wanted to ensure Ed, Edd n Eddy was produced in a way similar to cartoons from the 1940s to 1970s. As a result, the series was the last major animated series to use traditional cel animation; the cels were shipped to Korea for creating the initial animation, and then later edited back at Antonucci's a.k.a. Cartoon studio.[1] The first four seasons were produced traditionally. Starting with Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle in 2004, the series switched to digital ink and paint.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo give the impression of movement, Ed, Edd n Eddy uses \\"boiling lines\\" or shimmering outlines which Antonucci likens it to cartoons of the 1930s.[1] IGN has compared to Squigglevision,[8] and Animation World Magazine wrote that the way the line varies and shakes gives the animation a distinctive and spontaneous feeling, as if it were drawn by children.[9] The boiling line is created by tracing off a drawing three times through sheets of paper.[3] Antonucci explained that he felt it \\"helps keep the characters alive\\" and that he wanted to depart from other Cartoon Network series and pay homage to the classic cartoon era.[1][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the children have multicolored tongues; Antonucci said that the idea came after he saw his son and his friends with different-colored tongues because of eating different candy while he was working on a storyboard.[3] The characters went through a number of \\"walking cycles,\\" a process used to determine how each character should walk or run, turn around, blink, etc. before the crew came up with the final product.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAntonucci showed the theme song to the studios when first pitching the series, thinking it would be better than only looking at drawings.[3] It was inspired by the Bob Crosby and The Big Cats song \\"Big Noise from Winnetka,\\" which was whistled, something Antonucci enjoyed doing as a child.[3] Composed by Patric Caird, who created all the music in the series, Antonucci performed the whistling himself.[3] The theme song was featured on the compilation album Cartoon Medley.[10] The title sequence was created by Paul Boyd.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Ed, Edd n Eddy was originally set to premiere on November 7, 1998,[12] the pilot, \\"The Ed-touchables / Nagged to Ed,\\" aired on January 4, 1999, as the sixth Cartoon Cartoon, due to minor post-production delays.[13] During the series' original run, episodes often aired as a part of Cartoon Network's weekly programming block \\"Cartoon Cartoon Fridays.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nCartoon Network ran several marathons for either commercial promotions or special airings of one of their shows. The eight-hour \\"Boy Girl, Boy Girl\\" marathon ran on March 7, 1999, airing episodes of Ed, Edd n Eddy and The Powerpuff Girls, which had been Cartoon Network's two newest series at the time.[15][16] Later that year, Ed, Edd n Eddy was featured with other original Cartoon Network series in the third annual \\"Cartoon Cartoon Weekend,\\" a fifty-three-hour marathon, which ran from August 20 to August 22.[17] In 2002, the show was included in the similar \\"Cartoon Cartoon Marathon Weekend,\\" which ran from August 23 to August 25.[18] The six-hour \\"Ed's Day Off Marathon\\" aired 22 episodes on January 19, 2004, in celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The Best Day Edder,\\" in which every episode was shown in chronological order, ran from April 27 to April 28, 2007, and ended with the previously unbroadcast season five finale, which was promoted as the \\"final episode ever.\\"[20] However, it was quickly followed by \\"The Eds are Coming\\" in the next month, as part of a special alien-themed event called \\"Cartoon Network Invaded.\\"[21] As of May 2, 2007, \\"The Best Day Edder\\" provided Cartoon Network their best ratings of the year.[22] A seven-hour Sunday marathon, which ran before the premiere of Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, posted double-digit delivery gains among children ages 9ÿ14 (up 14%), boys ages 9ÿ14 (up 16%) and girls ages 6ÿ11 (up 17%), compared to the same time frame last year, highlighting the network's weekend performance.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series' fourth season was originally ordered as the last, but two additional seasons and four specials, including a movie, were ordered as a result of the series' popularity.[8][24] The series' finale movie, Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with an additional fifth and sixth season, Cartoon Network ordered three holiday specials that originally aired in 2004 and 2005.[24] \\"Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle,\\" the first, is a Christmas special aired on December 3, 2004.[26] Valentine's Day's \\"Ed, Edd n Eddy's Hanky Panky Hullabaloo\\" originally aired on February 11, 2005.[27] The final, Halloween special, \\"Ed, Edd n Eddy's Boo Haw Haw\\" aired on October 28, 2005.[28] Antonucci stated that \\"Boo Haw Haw\\" was one of his favorite Ed, Edd n Eddy episodes that he worked on.[6] On May 11, 2007, a fourth special, \\"The Eds are Coming, the Eds are Coming\\" aired; however, it was not a holiday special, but an adjunct to other Cartoon Network series Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, My Gym Partner's a Monkey, Camp Lazlo, and The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy in the alien-themed mini-series Cartoon Network Invaded that aired all five specials from May 4 to May 28, 2007.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides their own series, Ed, Double D, and Eddy have also appeared in other cartoon series. They appeared in an episode of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends and were drawn using that series' style of animation,[29] and made a short cameo in \\"The Grim Adventures of the KND,\\" a crossover of The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy and Codename: Kids Next Door. They also appeared on a small crossover poster during its credits entitled Ed, Edd n Mandy.[30] In 2012, Double D made an appearance in the animated sketch comedy Cartoon Network series Mad episode \\"Once Upon a Toon.\\"[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show was featured in the 2002 edition of Cartoon Network's fictional awards program, The 1st 13th Annual Fancy Anvil Awards Show Program Special: Live in Stereo. It won Best Performance by an Inanimate Object in a Dramatic Role for the character of Plank, and Best Performance by a Team in a Cartoon Series for the characters of Ed, Double D, and Eddy. The character of Sarah was nominated for Best Performance by a Female in a Cartoon Series, but lost to Bubbles from The Powerpuff Girls.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, the Eds appeared in a short series of basketball commercials with NBA All-Star Steve Francis.[33] Ed appeared in the \\"Cartoon Network Elections 2004\\" with Grim from The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy as a team, and they ended up winning, due to the highest number of votes by viewers.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nEd, Edd n Eddy attracted an audience of 31 million households, was broadcast in 120 countries, and was popular among both children and adults.[25][35] According to Cartoon Network executive Linda Simensky, the first season did \\"remarkably well\\" in ratings following its premiere, becoming one of the top-rated series on the network.[4] It was Cartoon Network's most popular show among boys ages 2ÿ11.[36] In 2005, it was reported that Ed, Edd n Eddy was the number one rated show on Cartoon Network and was known to 79% of children aged 6ÿ11.[37] The series ran for nearly 11 years, making it the longest-running Cartoon Network original series,\\r\\nand at the time of its finale, the longest running Canadian-produced animated series.[25][38] It is tied with Blue's Clues , Wonder Pets! and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse as the ninth longest-running American animated series.\\r\\n\\r\\nEd, Edd n Eddy received generally positive reviews from critics. David Cornelius of DVD Talk considered the Eds to be child equivalents of The Three Stooges, believing that \\"the series revels in the sort of frantic, often gross humor kids love so much, and there's just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults giggle just as easily.\\"[39] Cornelius also wrote that the \\"animation is colorful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming the characters and backgrounds wiggle and morph in a delirious haze. This is animation that's, well, really animated.\\"[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite this, not all reception of the show was positive. Terrence Briggs of Animation World Magazine considered every second of the show \\"filler\\" and lamented that the main characters are drawn as \\"products from the school of acid-trip caricature.\\"[40] After Briggs' review was published, a large number of letters supportive of the show were sent to the magazine, prompting it to \\"take a second look\\" at the show. Different reviewers then gave it a positive review, calling it a \\"fresh show with very different approaches.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its run, Ed, Edd n Eddy was nominated for a Reuben Award, six Leo Awards, an Annie Award, two Kids' Choice Awards and a SOCAN Award, winning the Reuben Award, two Leo Awards and the SOCAN Award. It was ranked seventh on ScrewAttack's \\"Top Twenty Cartoon Network Shows.\\"[41] Desi Jedeikin of Smosh.com listed Ed, Edd n Eddy on the website's list of \\"9 Cartoons That Need a Reboot.\\"[42] Complex included Eddy's room on their list of \\"Movie and TV Characters' Bedrooms You Wished Were Yours,\\"[43] and ranked Jimmy 14th on their list of \\"15 Artistic Characters We Miss From Our Childhood.\\"[44] Cracked.com praised the show's high level of violence, stating that it \\"set the bar on cartoon violence for anything that was played on Cartoon Network, and thus far, none have surpassed them.\\"[45] Bob Higgins, head of creative at Wild Brain, considered Ed, Edd n Eddy to be a \\"landmark in animation.\\"[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nCartoon Network produced short cartoons involving the Eds which were shown during commercial breaks. A short music video was produced with stylized versions of Ed, Edd, Eddy and Sarah, entitled \\"The Incredible Shrinking Day\\" (listed on the Season 2 DVD as \\"I'm Not Coming in Anymore\\"),[3] which aired on Cartoon Network in 2002 and 2003. In the video, Sarah uses a potion to shrink the Eds to a size capable of playing in her dollhouse, with predictable results.[58] Plank starred in a similar video called \\"My Best Friend Plank,\\" which aired in 2002.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe made-for-TV movie Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show served as the series' finale and premiered in the United States on November 8, 2009; although it had completed production a year earlier and first aired in Scandinavia, Australia, and Southeast Asia.[60][61] The plot focuses on the Eds' search for Eddy's Brother, a character mentioned several times throughout the series, but never seen until the film. He is voiced by series voice director Terry Klassen.[7][62] The film was directed by Antonucci, who also co-wrote the script with Rachel Connor, Jono Howard, Mike Kubat, and Stacy Warnick.[62] The story was written by Joel Dickie, Steve Garcia, Jim Miller, Raven Molisee, and Scott Underwood,[7] while the score was written by series composer Patric Caird.[62] The film achieved huge ratings success for Cartoon Network with high delivery gains.[23][25][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nEd, Edd n Eddy was regularly featured in DC Comics' Cartoon Network Block Party (originally Cartoon Cartoons, the collective name of original Cartoon Network series from 1995 to 2003) comic books, along with other Cartoon Network series.[63] Two books based on the series have been released, both published by Scholastic Inc. in 2005: Ed, Edd n Eddy: Lots of Laughs, written by Jesse Leon McCann,[64] and Ed, Edd n Eddy: Book of Extreme Excuses, written by Howie Dewin.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour video games based on the series have been produced. Ed, Edd n Eddy: Jawbreakers! was released on September 15, 2003, for the Game Boy Advance.[66] Ed, Edd n Eddy: Giant Jawbreakers was released on March 4, 2004, for mobile phones.[67] Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures was released in 2005 for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and PC.[68] The most recent game, Ed, Edd n Eddy: Scam of the Century, was released for the Nintendo DS on October 26, 2007.[69] The games were met with generally mixed reception.[70][71][72][73]\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacters and locations from the show appear in other Cartoon Network video games, including 2003's Cartoon Network: Block Party and Cartoon Network Speedway.[74][75] All three main characters, and the Kanker sisters, appear as non-playable \\"Nano\\" characters in the massively multiplayer online game Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first two seasons of Ed, Edd n Eddy were released as DVD box sets by Warner Home Video and Madman Entertainment in 2006 and 2007. The Fools' Par-Ed-Ise DVD, the box sets of the first two seasons, and several Ed, Edd n Eddy T-shirts are available for purchase on the Cartoon Network Shop.[78] Selected episodes from the series were also featured on various Cartoon Network compilation DVDs.[79] All five seasons of the series, as well as Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, are available for download on the iTunes Store.[80] The first four seasons were available on Netflix from March 2013 [81] until March 2015.[82] The third season can be downloaded at Google Play and Amazon. The Eds and Sarah have been free toys in children's meals for Subway.[83] In the United Kingdom the character of Eddy was given away in Kelloggs cereal boxes as one of the Cartoon Network Wobble Heads in 2003 .[84]","input":"What's the longest running cartoon network show?"},{"output":"FIFA series","context":"EA Sports is a division and brand of Electronic Arts that creates and develops sports video games. Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts, in which they tried to imitate real-life sports networks by calling themselves the \\"EA Sports Network\\" (EASN) with pictures or endorsements with real commentators such as John Madden, it soon grew up to become a sub-label on its own, releasing game series such as NBA Live, FIFA, NHL, Madden NFL, and NASCAR. The best selling EA Sports series is the FIFA series with over 100 million units sold.[2]\\r\\nMost games under this brand are developed by EA Canada, the studio of Electronic Arts in Burnaby, British Columbia, as well as EA Blackbox, Vancouver, British Columbia and EA Tiburon in Maitland, Florida. The main rival to EA Sports is 2K Sports. Notably, both companies compete over the realm of NBA games. Konami is its rival in association football games.\\r\\nEA Sports inherits its motto \\"It's in the game\\" from the parent company, Electronic Arts. It was voiced by journalist Andrew Anthony.\\r\\nUnlike some other sports game companies, EA Sports has no special ties to a single platform, which means that all games are released for the best-selling active platforms, sometimes long after most of the other companies abandon them. For example, FIFA 98, Madden NFL 98, NBA Live 98, and NHL 98 were released for the Sega Genesis and the Super NES throughout 1997; Madden NFL 2005 and FIFA 2005 had PlayStation released in 2004 (FIFA 2005 was also the last PlayStation title to be released); and NCAA Football 08 had an Xbox released in 2007. Madden NFL 08 also had Xbox and Nintendo GameCube releases in 2007, and was the final title released for the GameCube, with Madden NFL 09 following as the final Xbox title. Additionally, NASCAR Thunder 2003 and NASCAR Thunder 2004 were released not only for the PlayStation 2, but for the original PlayStation as well. EA Sports brand name is used to sponsor English Football League One team Swindon Town F.C. from the 2009ÿ10 season onward and the EA Sports Cup in the Republic of Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost EA Sports games are distinguished by year, as most games are released on a yearly basis. Nevertheless, as EA Sports is the leading purchaser of official licenses, it is not uncommon that in a short span several games of the same sport but with different licenses are released: FIFA 98 was shortly followed by World Cup 98 (as EA has the license for the FIFA World Cup and the European Football Championship, each happening regularly in four-year intervals), and college football and basketball games are released that are based on Madden NFL and NBA Live, respectively.\\r\\nIn 2002, EA purchased the license to NASCAR for six years, ending competition from Papyrus and Infogrames. They lost the NASCAR license in 2009 and the NASCAR license would be owned by Polyphony Digital for the Gran Turismo series starting with Gran Turismo 5, and also Eutechnyx for NASCAR The Game series until its inception in 2015.\\r\\nOn December 13, 2004, EA Sports signed an exclusive deal with the National Football League (NFL) and its Players' Union for five years. On February 12, 2008, EA Sports announced the extension of its exclusive deal until the 2012 NFL season.\\r\\nLess than a month after the NFL Exclusive deal, EA Sports signed a four-year exclusive deal with the Arena Football League (AFL).\\r\\nOn April 11, 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and EA Sports signed a deal to grant EA Sports the sole rights to produce college football games for six years.\\r\\nEA lost the rights for Major League Baseball (MLB) games to 2K Sports in 2005, ending EA's MVP series; however, EA made NCAA Baseball games in 2006 and 2007 after losing the MLB license. In January 2008, EA Sports decided not to renew their NCAA College Baseball license while they evaluate the status of their MVP game engine.[4]\\r\\nIn 2005, EA Sports and ESPN signed a massive 15-year deal for ESPN to be integrated into EA Sports video games from 2K Sports and Sega. EA's use of the ESPN license has steadily increased over the early life of the deal. EA's early usage of the ESPN license began with ESPN Radio and a sports ticker in titles like Madden NFL, NBA Live, Tiger Woods PGA Tour, and NCAA Baseball and Football. The ESPN integration now includes streaming podcasts, text articles (including content only available previously to ESPN Insider subscribers), and ESPN Motion video (including such programs as Pardon the Interruption).\\r\\nIn 2012, EA signs a \\"multi-year, multi-product\\" partnership with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, taking over from THQ.\\r\\nIn June 2009, EA Sports announced that for 2010, the games Madden NFL, NCAA Football, NASCAR, NHL, NBA Live, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour would not be shipped for PC platforms (Microsoft Windows and/or Mac OS X).[5][6] The NCAA Football series hadn't been released on the PC since 1998, The Tiger Woods series' last PC game was Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08, the NASCAR series hadn't had a PC version since NASCAR SimRacing in 2005, and the Madden series' last PC game was Madden NFL 08. The NHL series' last PC game was NHL 09. Likewise, NBA Live 08 was the final PC version for NBA Live.\\r\\nThe head of EA Sports at that time, Peter Moore, cited piracy and the fact that the \\"PC as a platform for authentic, fully-licensed, simulation sports games has declined radically in the past three years as the next generation consoles [...] have attracted millions of consumers.\\"[7][8]\\r\\nEA Sports released FIFA World as a free-to-play massively multi-player game which is exclusive to the PC on the 12th November 2013.\\r\\nThe company noted that the FIFA and FIFA Manager series would still be released for the PC platform.\\r\\nOn April 23, 2009, EA Sports released the long-awaited \\"EA Sports Complex\\" space for the PlayStation 3's online community-based service, PlayStation Home in the European and North American versions.[9] In the Complex, users can play a series of mini-games, including poker, kart racing, golf, and it also features a Virtual EA Shop. There are also a number of advertisements for upcoming EA Sports games. Each mini-game that the Complex features has a reward or rewards.

The EA Sports Complex featured racing and had a golfing range that was unavailable to play. The Upstairs had four poker tables that users could play at any time. With the June 18, 2009 update, the Complex's name changed to the EA Sports Racing Complex and the Upstairs changed to the EA Sports Complex Green Poker Room.[11] Other than the name change, the update took away the golfing range and added four more karts for users to play Racing at and it also added one red poker table to the poker room.\\r\\nThe July 2, 2009 update added golf and another poker room making four rooms for the Complex; the EA Sports Racing Complex, the EA Sports Golf Complex, the EA Sports Complex Green Poker Room, and the EA Sports Complex Red Poker Room. The Racing Complex features Racing with a total of eight karts; four on each side of the Complex. The Golf Complex features two Practice Ranges for golfing; one range on each side of the Complex. A Golf Pro-shop is coming soon for the Golf Complex. The Green Poker Room featured four green poker tables that users can play anytime. The Red Poker Room featured four red poker tables but requires users to have 2,000 points to play.\\r\\nOn July 16, 2009, EA Sports released another room for the Complex making five rooms for the Complex. This room is the game space for Fight Night Round 4 called \\"Club Fight Night\\" featuring a mini-game called Club DJ and coming soon, robot boxing.[12]\\r\\nOn July 30, 2009, EA Sports added a Black Poker Table to the EA Sports Complex Red Poker Room for the higher level players. In time, there will be a room dedicated for this table just like the Green Poker Room and the Red Poker Room. They also added a fifth green table to the Green Poker Room. The update also included the addition of the EA Sports Pro Shop where users can purchase full boxing outfits and furniture from Fight Night Round 4. The Pro Shop is found in the Racing Complex.[13] The August 16, 2009 update replaced the fifth green table in the Green Poker Room with a red table. They also reduced the amount of points for the Black Table from 20,000 to 10,000. The August 27, 2009 update separated the scoreboards for each level of play - Green, Red, and Black - and into Daily boards and Season boards (left side and right side), improved card readability, additional rail seating near the poker tables, player removal on lock-up while playing poker, and player buy-in refund on removal (does not refund on Home disconnect) while playing poker.[14]\\r\\nOn October 9, 2009, EA Sports released the EA Sports Complex to the Japanese version of Home. They also released NFL jerseys for every team in the league for purchase inside of the EA Sports Complex and in Home's shopping complex. EA Sports have also teamed up with the Home team to produce and distribute exclusive virtual items that serve to support National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 100% of proceeds for these items went go to the Brees Dream Foundation in support of breast cancer research and awareness programs. The items are black jerseys with a pink number 9 on the front and the name Brees on the back also in pink. These jerseys were available from October 15, 2009 to November 25, 2009.[15][16] On November 5, 2009, for those who purchased the Brees Breast Cancer jersey, they received a free DJ kit that is featured in the Club Fight Night space by entering one of the two EA Sports Complex poker rooms between November 5, 2009 and November 25, 2009.

Produced for CBS, the series premiered as part of the network's Saturday morning schedule on September 13, 1969, and aired for two seasons until October 31, 1970. In 1978, a selection of episodes from the later series Scooby's All-Stars and The Scooby-Doo Show were aired on ABC under the Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! name and, as such, is sometimes marketed as its third season.[5]\\r\\nThe series centers on a group of characters consisting of four teenagersFred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Norville \\"Shaggy\\" Rogersand the title character, a semi-anthropomorphic Great Dane. The group travel in a van named the Mystery Machine, solving mysteries involving several local legends; in doing so, they discover that the perpetrator is almost invariably a disguised person who seeks to exploit the legend for personal gain.\\r\\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You! was the first incarnation of what would eventually become a long-running media franchise, which primarily consists of subsequent animated series, several films, and related merchandise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScooby Doo, Where Are You! was the result of CBS and Hanna-Barbera's plans to create a non-violent Saturday morning program that would appease the parent watch groups that had protested the superhero-based programs of the mid-1960s.[6] Originally titled Mysteries Five, and later Who's S-S-Scared?, Scooby Doo, Where Are You! underwent a number of changes from script to screen (the most notable of which was the downplaying of the musical group angle borrowed from The Archie Show). However, the basic conceptfour teenagers (Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Shaggy) and a cowardly, clumsy Great Dane (Scooby-Doo) solving supernatural-related mysterieswas always in place.[7]\\r\\nScooby-Doo creators Joe Ruby and Ken Spears served as the story supervisors on the series.[8] Ruby, Spears, and Bill Lutz wrote all of the scripts for the seventeen first-season episodes, while Lutz, Larz Bourne, and Tom Dagenais wrote the eight second-season episodes with Ruby and Spears. The plot varied little from episode to episode. The main concept was as follows:\\r\\nThe second season featured bubblegum \\"chase scene\\" songs produced by La La Productions (which had originally been contracted to create the music for Josie and the Pussycats, the first of many animated series made from the same mold as Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!). These songs were written by Danny Janssen and Austin Roberts, and were performed by Roberts, who also made a new recording of the Scooby Doo, Where Are You! theme song for the second season. The series' theme song has been covered by several subsequent artists, including Matthew Sweet for the 1995 TV special and album Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits; Third Eye Blind for the 1998 film Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island; Billy Ray Cyrus for Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost (1999); Jennifer Love Hewitt for Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders (2000); the B-52's (Cindy, Kate and Fred) for Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase (2001); MxPx for the live-action Scooby-Doo film (2002); and Krystal Harris for Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire (2003).\\r\\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You! utilized a laugh track, a common feature in most animated TV series until the late 1970s. It was removed for syndication in the 1980s. Following Turner's purchase of Hanna-Barbera and its networks' (TBS, TNT and Cartoon Network) initial broadcast of the series in 1994, the laugh track was reinstated in 1997.\\r\\nScooby Doo, Where Are You! was a hit for Hanna-Barbera and CBS, which led Hanna-Barbera to eventually create series with similar concepts on ABC, NBC, and CBS, including, Josie and the Pussycats, The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show, The Pebbles, Dino and Bamm-Bamm segments on The Flintstone Comedy Show, The Funky Phantom, Speed Buggy, Jeannie, Jabberjaw, The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan, Inch High Private Eye, Goober and the Ghost Chasers, Clue Club, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids, and The New Shmoo.\\r\\nIn 2005, Scooby Doo, Where Are You! came 49th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Cartoons,[9] in the UK, and was more recently voted the 8th greatest Kids' TV Show by viewers of the same channel.[10] It was ranked the 24th greatest cartoon on IGN's Top 100 Animated Series.[11]\\r\\nOn July 4, 2002, Warner Home Video released four episodes from the series on a compilation DVD in Region 1 entitled Scooby-Doo's Creepiest Capers.

Arthur on August 3, 1882. It imposed a head tax on noncitizens of the United States who came to American ports and restricted certain classes of people from immigrating to America, including criminals, the insane, or \\"any person unable to take care of him or herself.\\" The act created what is recognized as the first federal immigration bureaucracy and laid the foundation for more regulations on immigration, such as the Immigration Act of 1891.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the passage of the Immigration Act of 1882, the United States Congress had passed two significant acts regarding immigration. The first was the Page Act of 1875, which restricted the immigration of forced laborers coming from Asia. This had a major effect on the immigration of Asian indentured workers and women; specifically women presumed to be immigrating to work as prostitutes. The second was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. This act halted all legal immigration of Chinese laborers and is considered by many to be the first major exclusionary immigration restriction on an entire nationality enacted by the United States. While both of these acts resulted from public fear of the Chinese influence in the labor market and the economy, they also derived from simple prejudice and the public perception of these immigrants' inability to assimilate into American culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the same time that America immigration was restricting Asian (specifically Chinese) immigration, many also criticized the influx of European immigrants ÿ later referred to as the \\"Great Wave\\" ÿ coming to the United States. As Europe's urban industrialization was changing the demographic landscape of life in many European cities, millions looked to immigrate in order to find opportunity in America. Calling it the \\"most massive of all human migrations to date,\\" scholar Otis. L. Graham reported that almost \\"27 million immigrants settled in the United States between 1880 and 1930\\".[1] Furthermore, as explained in Debating American Immigration: 1882ÿPresent, Roger Daniels explained how \\"great growth in the volume of immigration in the Gilded Age made some kind of organized administration necessary\\".[2] This need and call for an \\"organized administration\\" would later be somewhat realized in the administrative outcomes of the Immigration Act of 1882.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Immigration Act of 1882 shared the principle of immigration restriction with the two aforementioned acts, it was different in a fundamental way. Unlike the Chinese Exclusion act, the Immigration Act of 1882 would not limit all immigration from a certain country or region.  Certain European immigrants were considered extremely desirable, so to limit by region would deny desirable immigrants as well. Instead, to limit immigration based on excluding certain kinds of people who were deemed \\"undesirable\\", there needed to be a piece of legislation capable of adhering to a more comprehensive, exclusionary approach that would be administered through a federal government agency with federal policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 3, 1882, the forty-seventh United States Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1882.  It is considered by many to be \\"first general immigration law\\" due to the fact that it created the guidelines of exclusion through the creation of \\"a new category of inadmissible aliens.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two main components of the Immigration Act of 1882. The first was to create a \\"head tax\\" that would be imposed upon certain immigrants entering the country. The Act states that \\"There shall be levied, collected and paid a duty of fifty cents for each and every passenger not a citizen of the United States who shall come by steam or sail vessel from a foreign port to any port within the United States.\\" This money would be paid into the United States Treasury and \\"shall constitute a fund called the immigration fund.\\" These funds would be used to \\"defray the expense of regulating immigration under this act.\\" Scholar Roger Daniels commented that the head tax eventually \\"would rise, in stages, to eight dollars by 1917. In most years the government collected more in head taxes than it spent on administration.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creation of such administration, and the need to collect and disburse the head taxes throughout the bureaucratic chain, lead to the creation of \\"the first immigration bureaucracy.\\"[5] It was a significant turning point of immigration policy in terms of relying on federal level legislation and administration. While this was not the first federal immigration law, as others were mentioned previously, states and local levels of immigration ports were mainly in control of immigration policy. The Immigration Act of 1882 was the beginning of the \\"contours of federal oversight\\" in immigration policy administration.[6] In addition to the head tax, the Act also stipulated the responsibility of government agents to inspect ports and vessels bringing immigrants into the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis then lead to the second historically significant component of the Act. Upon inquiry of the vessels transporting immigrants, immigration officials were given the authority to expel certain immigrants based on criteria laid out within the Act. The legislation dictated that \\"If on such examination there shall be found among such passengers any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of him or herself without becoming a public charge, they shall report the same in writing to the collector of such port, and such person shall not be permitted to land.\\" Furthermore, if a criminal was found to be on board, it was the fiscal responsibility of the ship that brought the immigrant there to take them back out of the United States. The criminal provision of the act did not include immigrants who were \\"convicted of political offenses, reflecting the traditional American belief that the United States is a haven for those persecuted by foreign tyrants.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the long-lasting legacies of this act is the undesirable category called \\"likely to become a public charge.\\" At the time, this status could be assigned to any number of people including pregnant or single women, the disabled, the sick, or the poor. Daniels commented that the \\"'LPC clause' originally only kept out persons who were obviously unable to support themselves, but in the twentieth century the executive branch broadened it, first to keep out poor Asian Indians and Mexicans and then to keep out poor people generally.\\" [8] The Immigration Act of 1882 was the first piece of immigration regulation to contain this kind of comprehensive subjective restriction, and it would continue on into contemporary conversations and debates regarding immigration.","input":"When did america pass its first immigration law?"},{"output":"Christ the Redeemer","context":"","input":"What is the name of rio de janeiro's famous landmark?"},{"output":"at least 1,500","context":"","input":"How many passing attempts does tom brady have?"},{"output":"Paleo-Indian","context":"The history of Oklahoma refers to the history of the state of Oklahoma and the land that the state now occupies. Areas of Oklahoma east of its panhandle were acquired in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, while the Panhandle was not acquired until the U.S. land acquisitions following the MexicanÿAmerican War.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of Oklahoma was set aside as Indian Territory before the Civil War. It was opened for general settlement around 1890the \\"Sooners\\" were settlers who jumped the gun. Statehood came to the poor ranching and farming state in Oklahoma, but soon oil was discovered and new wealth poured in.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorians David Baird and Danney Goble have searched for the essence of the historical experiences of the people of Oklahoma. They find that, \\"The shared experiences of Oklahoma's people over time speak of optimism, innovation, perseverance, entrepreneurialism, common sense, collective courage, and simple decency. Those, not victimization, were the core values.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nTopographically, Oklahoma is situated between the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf of Mexico watershed.\\r\\n[2] The western part of the state is subjected to extended periods of drought and high winds in the region may then generate Dust storms. The eastern part of the state is humid subtropical climate zone. The Dry line, an imaginary line that separates moist air from an eastern body of water and dry desert air from the west, usually bisects the state and is arguably an important factor in pre-historic settlement, with agrarian tribes settling in the eastern part of the state and Hunter-gatherer tribes settling in the western part of the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople have lived in what is now Oklahoma as long as the oldest known documented Paleo-Indian cultures in the field of archaeology/anthropology. From the earliest known projectile points of the Clovis Culture to the highly advanced Folsom and breaking off down into the lesser known cultures whose artifacts and kill sites have been well documented all over the state (Dalton, Midland, HellGap, Alberta/Scottsbluff, Calf Creek), humans were present and very active in what is now today known as the State of Oklahoma.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded European to enter the region was Spanish Conquistador Hernando de Soto, who encountered many cultures of Caddoan languages-speakers, including the Caddo, Wichita, Pawnee, and Kichai peoples.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween AD 800 and 1450, much of the midwestern and southeastern US (including the eastern part of what is now Oklahoma) was home to a group of dynamic cultural communities that are generally known as the Mississippian culture. These cultures were agrarian, their communities often built ceremonial platform and burial mounds, and trade between communities was based on river travel. There were multiple chiefdoms that never controlled large areas or lasted more than a few hundred years.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caddoan Mississippian culture appears to have emerged from earlier groups of Woodland period groups, the Fourche Maline and Mossy Grove culture peoples who were living in the area around 200 BC to 800 AD.[4] By 800 AD early Caddoan society had begun to coalesce into one of the earlier Mississippian cultures. Some villages began to gain prominence as ritual centers, with elite residences and platform mound constructions. The mounds were arranged around open plazas, which were usually kept swept clean and were often used for ceremonial occasions. The Caddoan homeland was on the geographical and cultural edge of the Mississippian world and had similarities to both Mississippian Culture and Plains Traditions. The Caddoan communities were not as large as other eastern and southern Mississippian communities, they were not fortified, and they did not establish large, complex chiefdoms; with the possible exception of the Spiro Mounds on the Arkansas River. As complex religious and social ideas developed, some people and family lineages gained prominence over others. This hierarchical structure is marked in the archaeological record by the appearance of large tombs with exotic grave offerings of obvious symbols of authority and prestige, such as those found in the \\"Great Mortuary\\" at Spiro.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaeologists believe that ancestors of the Wichita people occupied the eastern Great Plains from the Red River north to Nebraska for at least 2,000 years.[6] These early Wichita people were hunters and gatherers who gradually adopted agriculture. Southern Plains villagers flourished throughout central and western Oklahoma from 900 to 1400.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout AD 900, on terraces above the Washita and South Canadian Rivers in Oklahoma, farming villages began to appear. The inhabitants of these villages grew corn, beans, squash, marsh elder, and tobacco. They hunted deer, rabbit, turkey, and increasingly bison, and caught fish and collected mussels in the rivers. These villagers lived in rectangular thatched houses.[7] They became numerous, with villages of up to 20 houses spaced every two or so miles along the rivers.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1500, Apache groups had also begun moving into formerly Wichita areas of Oklahoma. However, it appears that the two people co-existed in the region for some time. In addition to Apache influence, the Wichita of southwestern Oklahoma appear to have had regular trade contact with tribes in current Texas and New Mexico.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn historic times, the Kiowa and Apache have a history that is closely related. Both were hunter gatherers who used dogs to carry their belongings as they hunted from place to place. Both migrated from Canada to the Southwest around the time Francisco Coronado explored the Southwest and introduced the horse into the environment. And both tribes adapted their cultures to include the horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, linguistically, they are quite different. The Apache are a Southern Athabaskan group that traditionally live on the Southern Plains of North America. The Kiowa are part of a Tanoan group located in the Pueblos of New Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kiowa language is part of the Kiowa-Tanoan language family. Tanoan languages are those that were spoken in the Jemez, Piro, Tiwa, and Tewa pueblos of New Mexico. Linguists who study the history of languages, however, believe that Kiowa split from Tanoan branch over 3,000 years ago and moved to the far north.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kiowa and Apache adopted many of the same lifestyle traits, but remained ethnically distinct. Rather than learning each other's language, they communicated using Plains Indian Sign Language. The Kiowa and Plains Apache lived in the plains adjacent to the Arkansas River in southeastern Colorado and western Kansas and the Red River drainage of the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kiowas had a well structured tribal government like most tribes on the Northern Plains. They had a yearly Sun Dance gathering and a chieftain who was considered to be the leader of the entire tribe. There were warrior societies and religious societies that made up the Kiowa society.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, the Apache culture seems to have been similar to the Pueblo peoples of the area. However, once the Spanish exercised their power over the area, traditional trade patterns between the tribes was disrupted and the Pueblo were forced to work Spanish mission lands and care for mission flocks. The Pueblo became subsistence laborers; they had fewer surplus goods to trade with their neighbors. The Apache quickly acquired horses, improving their mobility for quick raids on settlements.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1682, Ren-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle claimed all of the Mississippi River and its tributaries for the Kingdom of France.  As such, the land that would become Oklahoma was under French control from 1682ÿ1763 as part of the territory of Louisiana (New France). Colonization efforts primarily occurred in the northern aspects (e.g., Illinois) and the Mississippi River valley; Oklahoma would be untouched by French colonial efforts. At the conclusion of the Seven Years' War and its North American counterpart, the French and Indian War, France was forced to cede the eastern part of the territory in 1763 to the British as part of the Treaty of Paris. France had already ceded the entire territory to the Kingdom of Spain in 1762 in the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau; the transfer to Spain was not publicly announced until 1764. Spain, which ceded Spanish Florida to the British in the Treaty of Paris in order to regain its colonies in Havana and Manila, did not contest British authority over the eastern part of French Louisiana as it desired the western portion that was adjacent to its colony of New Spain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish colonization efforts focused on New Orleans and its surroundings, and so Oklahoma remained free from European settlement during Spanish rule.  In 1800, France regained sovereignty of the western territory of Louisiana in the secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. But, strained by obligations in Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte decided to sell the territory to the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the United States acquired France's 828,000 square mile claim to the watersheds of the Mississippi River (west of the river) and Missouri River. The purchase encompassed all or part of 15 current U.S. states] (including all of Oklahoma) and parts of two Canadian provinces.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the Louisiana Purchase, Louisiana Territory and Orleans Territory were organized. Orleans Territory became the state of Louisiana in 1812, and Louisiana Territory was renamed Missouri Territory to avoid confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nArkansas Territory was created out of the southern part of Missouri Territory in 1819. The border was established at parallel 3630' north with the exception of the Missouri Bootheel. Arkansas Territory thus included all of the present state of Oklahoma south of this latitude.  When Missouri achieved statehood in 1821, the territorial lands not included within the state's boundaries effectively became an unorganized territory.  On November 15, 1824, the westernmost portion of Arkansas Territory was removed and included with the unorganized territory to the north, and a second westernmost portion was removed on May 6, 1828, reducing Arkansas Territory to the extent of the present state of Arkansas.  This new western border of Arkansas was originally intended to follow the western border of Missouri due south to the Red River. However, during negotiations with the Choctaw in 1820, Andrew Jackson unknowingly ceded more of Arkansas Territory to them than was realized. Then in 1824, after further negotiations, the Choctaw agreed to move farther west, but only by \\"100 paces\\" of the garrison on Belle Point. This resulted in the bend in the Arkansas/Oklahoma border at Fort Smith, Arkansas.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AdamsÿOns Treaty of 1819 was between the United States and Spain. Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the U.S., the U.S. gave fringe areas in the West to Spain, and the boundary was established between the U.S. and New Spain. The new boundary was to be the Sabine River north from the Gulf of Mexico to the 32nd parallel north, then due north to the Red River, west along the Red River to the 100th meridian west, due north to the Arkansas River, west to its headwaters, north to the 42nd parallel north, and finally west along that parallel to the Pacific Ocean. Informally this was called the \\"Step Boundary\\", although its step-like shape was not apparent for several decades. This is because the source of the Arkansas, which was believed to be near the 42nd parallel, is actually hundreds of miles south of that latitude, a fact that was not known until John C. Frmont discovered it in the 1840s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AdamsÿOns Treaty thus delineated the southern (Red River) and primary western (100th meridian west) borders of the future state of Oklahoma. It was also by this treaty that the land comprising the Oklahoma Panhandle was separated from the rest of the future state and ceded to the Spanish government.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early history of the United States as a nation, a challenging issue was the management of frontier settlement in the traditional lands of the Native Americans. One approach to obtain land in or near the established states was to relocate tribes to unsettled territory further west.  In 1820 (Treaty of Doak's Stand) and 1825 (Treaty of Washington City), the Choctaw were given lands in the Arkansas Territory (including in the current state of Oklahoma) in exchange for part of their homeland, primarily in the state of Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis approach became more formalized in 1830 via the passage of the Indian Removal Act. This act gave President Andrew Jackson the power to negotiate treaties for removal with Indian tribes living east of the Mississippi River. The treaty called for the Indians to give up their eastern land for land in the west. Those who wished to stay behind were required to assimilate and become citizens in their state. For the tribes that agreed to Jackson's terms, the removal was peaceful, however those who resisted were eventually forced to leave.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of what became Oklahoma was designated as the home for the relocation of the Five Civilized Tribes; it was \\"at the time the only available location where the Indians would not be in the way of white expansion.\\"[15]:140 Later the area would be referred to as Indian Country or Canadian Indian Territory. The goal was to provide ample lands for the relocation of Native Americans in the eastern states who did not wish to assimilate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Choctaw was the first of the \\"Five Civilized Tribes\\" to be removed from the southeastern United States. In September 1830, Choctaws in Mississippi agreed to terms of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek and prepared to move west.[16][17]\\r\\nThe phrase \\"Trail of Tears\\" originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831, although the term is also used in reference to the Cherokee removal in 1838-39.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Creek refused to relocate and signed a treaty in March 1832 to open up a large portion of their land in exchange for protection of ownership of their remaining lands. The United States failed to protect the Creeks, and in 1837, they were militarily removed without ever signing a treaty.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chickasaw saw the relocation as inevitable and signed a treaty in 1832 which included protection until their move. The Chickasaws were forced to move early as a result of white settlers and the War Department's refusal to protect the Indian's lands.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1833, a small group of Seminoles signed a relocation treaty. However, the treaty was declared illegitimate by a majority of the tribe. The result was the Second Seminole War (1835ÿ42) and Third Seminole War (1855-58). Those that survived the wars eventually were paid to move west.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Treaty of New Echota of 1835 gave the Cherokees living in the state of Georgia two years to move west, or they would be forced to move. At the end of the two years only 2,000 Cherokees had migrated westward and 16,000 remained on their lands. The U.S. sent 7,000 soldiers to force the Cherokee to move without the time to gather their belongings. This march westward is known as the Trail of Tears, in which 4,000 Cherokee died.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1821, New Spain gained its independence and became the short-lived Mexican Empire, followed by the Mexican Republic in 1824. Thus Mexico was the new owner of the lands to the south and west of the U.S. Territories. Texas, a province within Mexico, declared its independence from Mexico in 1836 following the Texas Revolution. The Republic of Texas existed as a separate country from 1836 to 1845.\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas was annexed as a state into the United States in 1845, and the MexicanÿAmerican War followed from 1846ÿ1848.  The war was concluded by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, in which the U.S. received the lands contentiously claimed from Mexico by Texas (including the Oklahoma Panhandle), as well as lands west of the Rio Grande to the Pacific Ocean (the Mexican Cession).  Statehood for Texas was politically charged, as it added another \\"slave state\\" to the Union, and the conditions for its statehood were not resolved until the Compromise of 1850.  One of the conditions was that to be admitted as a slave state, Texas had to set its northern border at parallel 3630' north as per the Missouri Compromise.  In addition to relinquishing claims on lands north of this parallel, Texas also had to give up its claim to parts of what is now New Mexico east of the Rio Grande, however in exchange the U.S. assumed Texas' $10 million debt.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 30, 1854, the Kansas and Nebraska Territories were established from the Indian Territory. The southern boundary of the Kansas Territory was set at the 37th parallel north, establishing the northern border of the future state of Oklahoma.  This also resulted in an unassigned strip of land existing between Kansas's southern border and the northern border of the Texas Panhandle at 3630' north, a neutral strip or \\"No Man's Land\\" that eventually became the Oklahoma Panhandle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1860, the Indian Territory had a population of 55,000 Indians, 8,400 black slaves owned by Indians, and 3000 whites. In 1861, as the American Civil War began, Texas forces moved north and the United States withdrew its military forces from the territory. Confederate Commissioner Albert Pike signed formal treaties of alliance with all the major tribes, and the territories sent a delegate to the Confederate Congress in Richmond. However, there were minority factions who opposed the Confederacy, with the result that a small-scale Civil War raged inside the territory. A force of Union troops and loyal Indians invaded Indian Territory and won a strategic victory at Honey Springs on July 17, 1863. By late summer 1863, Union forces controlled Fort Smith in neighboring Arkansas, and Confederate hopes for retaining control of the territory collapsed. Many pro-Confederate Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole Indians fled south, becoming refugees among the Chickasaw and Choctaws. However, Confederate Brigadier General Stand Watie, a Cherokee, captured Union supplies and kept the insurgency active. Watie was the last Confederate general to give up; he surrendered on June 23, 1865.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Civil War, Congress passed a statute (still in effect) that gave the President the authority to suspend the appropriations of any tribe if the tribe is \\"in a state of actual hostility to the government of the United States  and, by proclamation, to declare all treaties with such tribe to be abrogated by such tribe.\\" (25 USC Sec. 72)[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1866 the federal government forced the tribes that had allied with the Confederacy into new Reconstruction Treaties. Most of the land in central and western Indian Territory was ceded to the government. Some of the land was given to other tribes, but the central part, the so-called Unassigned Lands, remained with the government. Another concession allowed railroads to cross Indian lands. Furthermore, the practice of slavery was outlawed. Some nations were integrated racially with their slaves, but other nations were extremely hostile to the former slaves and wanted them exiled from their territory. It was also during this time that the policy of the federal government gradually shifted from Indian removal and relocation to one of assimilation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1870s, a movement began by whites and blacks wanting to settle the government lands in the Indian Territory under the Homestead Act of 1862. They referred to the Unassigned Lands as Oklahoma and to themselves as \\"Boomers\\". In 1884, in United States v. Payne, the United States District Court in Topeka, Kansas, ruled that settling on the lands ceded to the government by the Indians under the 1866 treaties was not a crime. The government at first resisted, but Congress soon enacted laws authorizing settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1880s, early settlers of the state's very sparsely populated Panhandle region tried to form the Cimarron Territory but lost a lawsuit against the federal government. This prompted a judge in Paris, Texas, to unintentionally create a moniker for the area. \\"That is land that can be owned by no man\\", the judge said, and after that the panhandle was referred to as No Man's Land until statehood arrived decades later.\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress passed the Dawes Act, or General Allotment Act, in 1887 requiring the government to negotiate agreements with the tribes to divide Indian lands into individual holdings. Under the allotment system, tribal lands left over would be surveyed for settlement by non-Indians. Following settlement, many whites accused Republican officials of giving preferential treatment to ex-slaves in land disputes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States entered into two new treaties with the Creeks and the Seminoles. Under these treaties, tribes would sell at least part of their land in Oklahoma to the U.S. to settle other Indian tribes and freemen.[21][22] This land would be widely called the Unassigned Lands or Oklahoma Country in the 1880s due to it remaining uninhabited for over a decade.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1879, part-Cherokee Elias C. Boudinot argued that these Unassigned Lands be open for settlement because the title to these lands belonged to the United States and \\"whatever may have been the desire or intention of the United States Government in 1866 to locate Indians and negroes upon these lands, it is certain that no such desire or intention exists in 1879. The Negro since that date, has become a citizen of the United States, and Congress has recently enacted laws which practically forbid the removal of any more Indians into the Territory\\".[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 23, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison signed legislation which opened up the two million acres (8,000?km2) of the Unassigned Lands for settlement on April 22, 1889. It was to be the first of many land runs, but later land openings were conducted by means of a lottery because of widespread cheatingsome of the settlers were called Sooners because they had already staked their land claims before the land was officially opened for settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian Territory (lands owned by the Five Civilized Tribes and other Indian tribes from east of the Mississippi River) and Oklahoma Territory (lands set aside to relocate Plains Indians and other Midwestern tribes, as well as the recently settled \\"Unassigned Lands\\" and the Neutral Strip) were formally constituted by Congress on May 2, 1890 in the Oklahoma Organic Act. An Organic Act is a statute used by the U.S. Congress to create organized incorporated territories in anticipation of them being admitted to the Union as state(s). The following 16 years saw Congress pass several laws whose purpose was to join Oklahoma and Indian territories into a single State of Oklahoma.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1893, the government purchased the rights to settle the Cherokee Outlet, or Cherokee Strip, from the Cherokee Nation. The Cherokee Outlet was part of the lands ceded to the government in the 1866 treaty, but the Cherokees retained access to the area and had leased it to several Chicago meat-packing plants for huge cattle ranches. The Cherokee Strip was opened to settlement by land run in 1893. Also in 1893 Congress set up the Dawes Commission to negotiate agreements with each of the Five Civilized Tribes for the allotment of tribal lands to individual Indians. Finally, the Curtis Act of 1898 abolished tribal jurisdiction over all of Indian Territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngie Debo's landmark work, And Still the Waters Run: The Betrayal of the Five Civilized Tribes (1940), detailed how the allotment policy of the Dawes Commission and the Curtis Act of 1898 was systematically manipulated to deprive the Native Americans of their lands and resources.[25] In the words of historian Ellen Fitzpatrick, Debo's book \\"advanced a crushing analysis of the corruption, moral depravity, and criminal activity that underlay white administration and execution of the allotment policy.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOklahoma is best known to the rest of the world for its frontier history, famously represented in the 1943 Broadway hit musical Oklahoma! and its 1955 cinema version. The musical is based on Lynn Riggs' 1931 play, Green Grow the Lilacs.  It is set in Oklahoma Territory outside the town of Claremore in 1906.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1902, the leaders of Indian Territory sought to become their own state, to be named Sequoyah. They held a convention in Eufaula, consisting of representatives from the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Muscogee (Creek), and Seminole tribes, known as the Five Civilized Tribes. They met again next year to establish a constitutional convention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sequoyah Constitutional Convention met in Muskogee, on August 21, 1905. General Pleasant Porter, Principal Chief of the Muscogee Creek Nation, was selected as president of the convention. The elected delegates decided that the executive officers of the Five Civilized Tribes would also be appointed as vice-presidents: William Charles Rogers, Principal Chief of the Cherokees; William H. Murray, appointed by Chickasaw Governor Douglas H. Johnston to represent the Chickasaws; Chief Green McCurtain of the Choctaws; Chief John Brown of the Seminoles; and Charles N. Haskell, selected to represent the Creeks (as General Porter had been elected President).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe convention drafted the constitution, established an organizational plan for a government, outlined proposed county designations in the new state, and elected delegates to go to the United States Congress to petition for statehood. If this had happened, the Sequoyah would have been the first state to have a Native American majority population.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe convention's proposals were overwhelmingly endorsed by the residents of Indian Territory in a referendum election in 1905. The U.S. government, however, reacted coolly to the idea of Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory becoming separate states; they preferred to have them share a singular state.\\r\\n\\r\\nMurray, known for his eccentricities and political astuteness, foresaw this possibility prior to the constitutional convention. When Johnston asked Murray to represent the Chickasaw Nation during Sequoyah's attempt at statehood, Murray predicted the plan would not succeed in Washington, D.C.. He suggested that if the attempt failed, the Indian Territory should work with the Oklahoma Territory to become one state. President Theodore Roosevelt and Congress turned down the Indian Territory proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing an opportunity for statehood, Murray and Haskell proposed another convention for the combined territories to be named Oklahoma. In 1906, the Oklahoma Enabling Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and approved by President Roosevelt. The act established several specific requirements for the proposed constitution.[28] Using the constitution from the Sequoyah convention as a basis (and the majority) of the new state constitution, Haskell and Murray returned to Washington with the proposal for statehood. On November 16, 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt signed the proclamation establishing Oklahoma as the nation's 46th state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early years of statehood were marked with political activity. In 1910, the Democrats moved the capital to Oklahoma City, three years before the Oklahoma Organic Act allowed, in order to move away from the Republican hotbed of Guthrie. Socialism became a growing force among struggling farmers, and Oklahoma grew to have the largest Socialist population in the United States at the time, with the Socialist vote doubling in every election until the American entry into World War I in 1917.[29] However, the war drove food prices up, allowing the farmers to prosper, and the movement faded away. By the 1920s, the Republican Party, taking advantage of rifts within the Democratic Party, gained control in the state. The economy continued to improve, in the areas of cattle ranching, cotton, wheat, and especially, oil. Throughout the 1920s, new oil fields were continually discovered and Oklahoma produced over 1.8 billion barrels of petroleum, valued at over 3.5 million dollars for the decade.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the first oil well in the United States was completed July 1850 in the old Cherokee Nation near Salina, it was in the early 20th century the oil business really began to get underway. Huge pools of underground oil were discovered in places like Glenpool near Tulsa. Many whites flooded into the state to make money. Many of the \\"old money\\" elite families of Oklahoma can date their rise to this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the 1920s, new oil fields were continually discovered and Oklahoma produced over 1.8 billion barrels of petroleum, valued at over 3.5 million dollars for the decade. In 1920 the spectacular Osage County oil field was opened, followed in 1926 by the Greater Seminole Oil Field. When the Great Depression Oklahoma and Texas oil was flooding the market and prices fell to pennies a gallon. In 1931 Governor William H. Murray, acting with characteristic decisiveness, used the National Guard to shut down all of Oklahoma's oil wells in an effort to stabilize prices. National policy became using the Texas Railroad Commission to set allotments in Texas, which raised prices as well for Oklahoma crude.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prosperity of the 1920s can be seen in the surviving architecture from the period, such as the Tulsa mansion which was converted into the Philbrook Museum of Art or the art deco architecture of downtown Tulsa.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Oklahoma, the early quarter of the 20th century was politically turbulent. Many different groups had flooded into the state; \\"black towns\\", or towns made of groups of African Americans choosing to live separately from whites, sprouted all over the state, while most of the state abided by the Jim Crow laws within each individual city, racially separating people with a bias against any non-white \\"race\\". Greenwood, a neighborhood in Northern Tulsa, was known as Black Wall Street because of the vibrant business, cultural, and religious community there. The area was destroyed in the 1921 Tulsa race riot, one of the United States' deadliest race riots.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile many all-black towns sprang up in the early days of Oklahoma, many have disappeared. The table below lists 13 such towns that have survived to the present.\\r\\n\\r\\nPopulation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oklahoma Socialist Party achieved a large degree of success in this era (the small party had its highest per-capita membership in Oklahoma at this time with 12,000 dues-paying members in 1914), including the publication of dozens of party newspapers and the election of several hundred local elected officials. Much of their success came from their willingness to reach out to Black and American Indian voters (they were the only party to continue to resist Jim Crow laws), and their willingness to alter traditional Marxist ideology when it made sense to do so (the biggest changes were the party's support of widespread small-scale land ownership, and their willingness to use religion positively to preach the \\"Socialist gospel\\"). The state party also delivered presidential candidate Eugene Debs some of his highest vote counts in the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party was later crushed into virtual non-existence during the \\"white terror\\" that followed the ultra-repressive environment following the Green Corn Rebellion and the World War I era paranoia against anyone who spoke against the war or capitalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Industrial Workers of the World tried to gain headway during this period but achieved little success.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisgruntled Oklahoma farmers and laborers handed left-wing Democrat Jack C. Walton an easy election victory in 1922 as governor. One scandal followed anotherWalton's questionable administrative practices included payroll padding, jailhouse pardons, removal of college administrators, and an enormous increase in the governor's salary. The conservative elements successfully petitioned for a special legislative recall session. To regain the initiative, Walton retaliated by attacking Oklahoma's Ku Klux Klan with a ban on parades, declaration of martial law, and employment of outsiders to 'keep the peace.'  He declared martial law in the entire state and tried to call out the National Guard to block the legislature from holding the special session. That failed, and legislators charged Walton with corruption, impeached him, and removed him from office in 1923.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Depression lasted from 1929 to the late 1930s. Times were especially hard in 1930ÿ33, as the prices of oil and farm products plunged, while debts remained high. Many banks and businesses went bankrupt. The Depression was made much worse for parts of the state by the Dust Bowl conditions. Farmers were hit the hardest and many relocated to the cities and established poor communities known as Hoovervilles. It also initiated a mass migration to California of \\"Okies\\" (to use the disparaging term common in California) in search of a better life, an image that would be popularized in American culture by John Steinbeck's novel, The Grapes of Wrath.  The book, with photographs by Dorothea Lange, and songs of Woody Guthrie tales of woe from the era. The negative images of the \\"Okie\\" as a sort of rootless migrant laborer living in a near-animal state of scrounging for food greatly offended many Oklahomans. These works often mix the experiences of former sharecroppers of the western American South with those of the exodusters fleeing the fierce dust storms of the High Plains. Although they primarily feature the extremely destitute, the vast majority of the people, both staying in and fleeing from Oklahoma, suffered great poverty in the Depression years. Grapes of Wrath was a powerful but simplistic view of the complex conditions in rural Oklahoma, and fails to mention the great majority of people remained in Oklahoma.[33]\\r\\nThe federal Agricultural Adjustment Act paid them to reduce production; prices rose and the distress was over,\\r\\n\\r\\nShort-term drought and long-term poor agricultural practices led to the Dust Bowl, when massive dust storms blew away the soil from large tracts of arable land and deposited it on nearby farms or even far-distant locations. The resulting crop failures forced many small farmers to flee the state altogether. Although the most persistent dust storms primarily affected the Panhandle, much of the state experienced occasional dusters, intermittent severe drought, and occasional searing heat. Towns such as Alva, Altus, and Poteau each recorded temperatures of 120?F (49?C) during the epic summer of 1936.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economy was clearly recovering by 1940, as farm and cattle prices rose. So did the price of oil. Massive Federal spending on infrastructure during the Depression was also beginning to show payoffs. Even before World War II broke out, the Oklahoma industrial economy saw increased demand for its products. The Federal government created such defense-related facilities as the Oklahoma Ordnance Works near Pryor, Oklahoma and the Douglas Aircraft plant adjacent to the Tulsa Municipal Airport. Numerous air bases dotted the map of Oklahoma. (See Oklahoma World War II Army Airfields).\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert S. Kerr, governor 1943ÿ46 was an oilman who supported the New Deal and used his network of connections in Washington to secure federal money. Oklahoma built and expanded numerous army and navy installations and air bases, which in turn brought thousands of well-paid jobs. Kerr went on to become a powerful Senator (1949ÿ63) who watched out for the state's interests and especially for the oil and gas industry.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nOklahoma consistently rated among the top 10 states in war-bond sales, as it used showmanship, the spirit of competition, house-to-house solicitations, and direct appeals to big business to mobilize patriotism, state pride, and the need to save some of the high wages that could not be spent because of rationing and shortages. The bond drives enlisted schoolchildren, housewives and retired men, giving everyone a sense of direct participation in the war effort.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Okie\\" in recent years has taken on a new meaning in the past few decades, with many Oklahomans (both former and present) wearing the label as a badge of honor (as a symbol of the Okie survivor attitude). Others (mostly alive during the Dust Bowl era) still see the term negatively because they see the \\"Okie\\" migrants as quitters and transplants to the West Coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor trends in Oklahoma history after the Depression era included the rise again of tribal sovereignty (including the issuance of tribal automobile license plates, and the opening of tribal smoke shops, casinos, grocery stores, and other commercial enterprises), the rapid growth of suburban Oklahoma City and Tulsa, the drop in population in Western Oklahoma, the oil boom of the 1980s and the oil bust of the 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, major efforts have been made by state and local leaders to revive Oklahoma's small towns and population centers, which had seen major decline following the oil bust. But Oklahoma City and Tulsa remain economically active in their effort to diversify as the state focuses more into medical research, health, finance, and manufacturing.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcluding governmental and education sectors, the largest single employers in the state tend to be in the aeronautical sector. The building of Tinker Air Force Base and the FAA's Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City, and American Airlines Engineering center, Maintenance Facility and Data Center in Tulsa provide the state with a comparative advantage in the Aeronautical sector of the economy. AAR Corporation has operations in both Oklahoma City and Tulsa, and The Boeing Company and Pratt & Whitney are building a regional presence next to Tinker AFB.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state has a significant military (Air Force) presence with bases in Enid, Oklahoma (Vance Air Force Base) and Altus, Oklahoma (Altus Air Force Base), in addition to Tinker AFB in Oklahoma City. Additionally, Tinker houses the Navy's Strategic Communications Wing One.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Aeronautical education and training, Tulsa hosts the Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology that offers training in aviation and aircraft maintenance. Oklahoma University and Oklahoma State University both offer aviation programs. The FAA's Academy is responsible for training Air Traffic Controllers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oil and natural gas industry has historically been a dominant factor in the state's economy, second only to agriculture. The Tulsa Metropolitan Area has been home to more traditional oil companies such as ONEOK, Williams Companies, Helmerich & Payne, Magellan Midstream Partners with significant presence from ConocoPhillips. Oklahoma City is home to energy companies such as Devon Energy, Chesapeake Energy, OGE Energy, SandRidge Energy, Continental Resources. Duncan, Oklahoma is the birthplace of Halliburton Corporation. Significant research and education is done in the field by the Oklahoma University's Mewbourne College of Earth and Energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state has a surprisingly large concentration of companies that manufacture products that heat and cool buildings (HVAC). Among the companies in Tulsa are AAON (the former John Zink Company). In Oklahoma City are International Environmental, ClimateMaster, and Climate Control (subsidiaries of LSB Industries). Also, Governair and Temptrol (subsidiaries of CES Group) and York Unitary division of Johnson Controls have a major presence in the Oklahoma City metro. Also, Oklahoma State University has a major research effort in developing the Geothermal heat pump, and is headquarters for the International Ground Source Heat Pump Association.[36] Oklahoma State UniversityÿOkmulgee is known in the industry for its Air Conditioning Technology programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 19, 1995, in the Oklahoma City bombing, Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people, including 19 children. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were the convicted perpetrators of the attack, although many believe others were involved. Timothy McVeigh was later sentenced to death by lethal injection, while his partner, Terry Nichols, who was convicted of 161 counts of first degree murder received life in prison without the possibility of parole. It is said that McVeigh stayed at the El Siesta motel, a small town motel on US 64 in Vian, Oklahoma.","input":"Which culture established the first villages in oklahoma?"},{"output":"the rust-resistant composition of the metals used in its construction","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iron pillar of Delhi is a 7?m (23?ft) kirti stambha (column of fame or victory column), originally erected and dedicated as dhvaja (banner) to Hindu deity lord Vishnu in 3rd to 4th century CE by king Chandragupta II , currently standing in the Qutb complex at Mehrauli in Delhi, India.[1] It is famous for the rust-resistant composition of the metals used in its construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pillar has attracted the attention of archaeologists and materials scientists because of its high resistance to corrosion and has been called a \\"testimony to the high level of skill achieved by the ancient Indian iron smiths in the extraction and processing of iron.\\"[2][3] The corrosion resistance results from an even layer of crystalline iron hydrogen phosphate hydrate forming on the high-phosphorus-content iron, which serves to protect it from the effects of the Delhi climate.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pillar weighs over 6,000?kg (13,000?lb) and is thought to have originally been erected in what is now Udayagiri by one of the Gupta monarchs in approximately 402 CE, though the precise date and location are a matter of dispute.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe height of the pillar, from the top of its capital to the bottom of its base, is 7.21?m (23?ft 8?in), 1.12?m (3?ft 8?in) of which is below ground. Its bell pattern capital is 1.07?m (3?ft 6?in) in height, and its bulb-shaped base is 0.71?m (2?ft 4?in) high. The base rests on a grid of iron bars soldered with lead into the upper layer of the dressed stone pavement. The pillar's lower diameter is 420?mm (17?in), and its upper diameter is 306?mm (12?in). It is estimated to weigh more than six tonnes (13,228?lb).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA fence was erected around the pillar in 1997 in response to damage caused by visitors. There is a popular tradition that it was considered good luck if one could stand with one's back to the pillar and make one's hands meet behind it. The practice led to significant wear and visible discolouration on the lower portion of the pillar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pillar carries a number of inscriptions and graffiti of different dates, some of which have not been studied systematically despite the pillar's prominent location and easy access.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest inscription on the pillar is that of a king named Chandra (IAST: Candra), generally identified as the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inscription covers an area of 2'9.5\\" G 10.5\\". The ancient writing is preserved well because of the corrosion-resistant iron on which it is engraved. However, during the engraving process, iron appears to have closed up over some of the strokes, making some of the letters imperfect.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt contains verses composed in Sanskrit language, in shardulvikridita metre.[8] It is written in the eastern variety of the Gupta script. The letters vary from 0.3125\\" to 0.5\\" in size, and resemble closely to the letters on the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta. However, it had distinctive matras (diacritics), similar to the ones in the Bilsad inscription of Kumaragupta I.[9] While the edges of the characters on the Allahabad inscription are more curved, the ones on the Delhi inscription have more straight edges. This can be attributed to the fact that the Allahabad inscription was inscribed on softer sandstone, while the Delhi inscription is engraved on the harder material (iron).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe text has some unusual deviations from the standard Sanskrit spelling, such as:[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1831, the East India Company officer William Elliott made a facsimile of the inscription. Based on this facsimile, in 1834, James Prinsep published a lithograph in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland (JASB). However, this lithograph did not represent even a single letter of the inscription correctly. Some years later, British engineer T. S. Burt made an ink impression of the inscription. Based on this, in 1838, Prinsep published an improved lithograph in the same journal, with his reading of the script and translation of the text.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nDecades later, Bhagwan Lal Indraji made another copy of the inscription on a cloth. Based on this copy, Bhau Daji Lad published a revised text and translation in 1875, in Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (JBBRAS). This reading was the first one to correctly mention the king's name as Chandra. In 1888, John Faithfull Fleet published a critical edition of the text in Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1945, Govardhan Rai Sharma dated the inscription to the first half of the 5th century CE, on paleographic grounds.[12] He observed that its script was similar to the writing on other Gupta-era inscriptions, including the ones discovered at Bilsad (415 CE), Baigram (449 CE), and Kahanum (449 CE).[10] R. Balasubramaniam (2005) noted that the characters of the Delhi inscription closely resembled the dated inscriptions of Chandragupta II, found at Udayagiri in Madhya Pradesh.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inscription is undated, and contains a eulogy of a king named Chandra, whose dynasty it does not mention.[9] The identity of this king, and thus the date of the pillar, has been the subject of much debate. The various viewpoints about the identity of the issuer were assembled and analyzed in a volume edited by M. C. Joshi and published in 1989.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king is now generally identified with the Gupta King Chandragupta II.[15] This identification is based on several points:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the inscription is a eulogy and states that the king has abandoned the earth, there has been some discussion as to whether it is posthumous, i.e. whether king Chandra was dead when the record was created. Dasharatha Sharma (1938) argued that it was non-posthumous.[18] According to B. Chhabra and G. S. Gai, the inscription states that the king's mind is \\"fixed upon Vishnu with devotion\\", and therefore, indicates that the king was alive at the time. They theorize that it may have been recorded when Chandragupta II abdicated his throne, and settled down as a vanaprastha (retiree) in Vishnupada.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a volume published in 2009, Michael Willis has summarised the debates and re-translated the relevant portions of the epigraph. He concludes: \\"Candragupta may have passed away but the legacy of his achievement is so great that he seems to remain on earth by virtue of his fame. Emphasis is placed on Candraguptas conquest of enemies and the merit of his deeds, ideas which are also found in coin legends: k?itim avajitya sucaritair diva? jayati vikramditya?, i.e. Having conquered the earth with good conduct, Vikramditya conquered heaven. The kings conquest of heaven combined with the description of him resorting to the other world in bodily form (gm ?ritasyetar? mrty), confirms our understanding of the worthy dead as autonomous theomorphic entities.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing is the Roman script transliteration of the text:[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nJ. F. Fleet's 1888 translation is as follows:[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the tablets installed on the building in 1903 by Pandit Banke Rai, the reading provided by him enjoys wide currency. However, Bankelal's reading and interpretation have been challenged by more recent scholarship. The inscription has been revisited by Michael Willis in his book Archaeology of Hindu Ritual, his special concern being the nature of the king's spiritual identity after death. His reading and translation of verse 2 is as follows:[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sanskrit portion given above can be translated as follows:[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nWillis concludes: \\"Candragupta may have passed away but the legacy of his achievement is so great that he seems to remain on earth by virtue of his fame.

Alexander Cunningham (1862-63) read the inscription as follows:[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on this reading, Cunningham theorized that Anangpal had moved the pillar to its current location while establishing the city of Delhi. However, his reading has been contested by the later scholars. Buddha Rashmi Mani (1997) read it as follows:[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the pillar was certainly used as a trophy in building the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque and the Qutb complex, its original location, whether on the site itself or from elsewhere, is debated.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the inscription of king Chandra, the pillar was erected at Vishnupadagiri (Vishnupada). J. F. Fleet (1898) identified this place with Mathura, because of its proximity to Delhi (the find spot of the inscription) and the city's reputation as a Vasihnavite pilgrimage centre. However, archaeological evidence indicates that during the Gupta period, Mathura was a major centre of Buddhism, although Vaishnavism may have existed there. Moreover, Mathura lies in plains, and only contains some small hillocks and mounds: there is no true giri (hill) in Mathura.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on paleographic similarity to the dated inscriptions from Udayagiri, the Gupta-era iconography, analysis of metallurgy and other evidence, Meera Dass and R. Balasubramaniam (2004) theorized that the iron pillar was originally erected at Udayagiri.[13][27] According to them, the pillar, with a wheel or discus at the top, was originally located at the Udayagiri Caves.[28] This conclusion was partly based on the fact that the inscription mentions Vishnupada-giri (IAST: Vi??upadagiri, meaning \\"hill with footprint of Vi??u\\"). This conclusion was endorsed and elaborated by Michael Willis in his Archaeology of Hindu Ritual, published in 2009.[29] The key point in favour of placing the iron pillar at Udayagiri is that this site was closely associated with Chandragupta and the worship of Vishnu in the Gupta period. In addition, there are well-established traditions of mining and working iron in central India, documented particularly by the iron pillar at Dhar and local place names like Lohapura and Lohangؐ Pؐr (see Vidisha). The king of Delhi, Iltutmish, is known to have attacked and sacked Vidisha in the thirteenth century and this would have given him an opportunity to remove the pillar as a trophy to Delhi, just as the Tughluq rulers brought Asokan pillars to Delhi in the 1300s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not certain when the pillar was moved to Delhi from its original location. Alexander Cunningham attributed the relocation to the Tomara king Anangpal, based on the short pillar inscription ascribed to this king.[23] Pasanaha Chariu, an 1132 CE Jain Apabhramsha text composed by Vibudh Shridhar, states that \\"the weight of his pillar caused the Lord of the Snakes to tremble\\". The identification of this pillar with the iron pillar lends support to the theory that the pillar was already in Delhi during Anangpal's reign.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother theory is that the relocation happened during the Muslim rule in Delhi. Some scholars have assumed that it happened around 1200 CE, when Qutb al-Din Aibak commenced the construction of the Qutb complex as a general of Muhammad of Ghor.[31] Finbarr Barry Flood (2009) theorizes that it was Qutb al-Din's successor Iltutmish (r. 1210-36 CE), who moved the pillar to Delhi.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pillar was manufactured by the forge welding of pieces of wrought iron. In a report published in the journal Current Science, R. Balasubramaniam of the IIT Kanpur explains how the pillar's resistance to corrosion is due to a passive protective film at the iron-rust interface. The presence of second-phase particles (slag and unreduced iron oxides) in the microstructure of the iron, that of high amounts of phosphorus in the metal, and the alternate wetting and drying existing under atmospheric conditions are the three main factors in the three-stage formation of that protective passive film.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nLepidocrocite and goethite are the first amorphous iron oxyhydroxides that appear upon oxidation of iron. High corrosion rates are initially observed. Then, an essential chemical reaction intervenes: slag and unreduced iron oxides (second phase particles) in the iron microstructure alter the polarisation characteristics and enrich the metalÿscale interface with phosphorus, thus indirectly promoting passivation of the iron[33] (cessation of rusting activity). The second-phase particles act as a cathode, and the metal itself serves as anode, for a mini-galvanic corrosion reaction during environment exposure. Part of the initial iron oxyhydroxides is also transformed into magnetite, which somewhat slows down the process of corrosion. The ongoing reduction of lepidocrocite and the diffusion of oxygen and complementary corrosion through the cracks and pores in the rust still contribute to the corrosion mechanism from atmospheric conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next main agent to intervene in protection from oxidation is phosphorus, enhanced at the metalÿscale interface by the same chemical interaction previously described between the slags and the metal. The ancient Indian smiths did not add lime to their furnaces. The use of limestone as in modern blast furnaces yields pig iron that is later converted into steel; in the process, most phosphorus is carried away by the slag.[34] The absence of lime in the slag and the use of specific quantities of wood with high phosphorus content (for example, Cassia auriculata) during the smelting induces a higher phosphorus content (> 0.1%, average 0.25%) than in modern iron produced in blast furnaces (usually less than 0.05%). One analysis gives 0.10% in the slags for 0.18% in the iron itself. This high phosphorus content and particular repartition are essential catalysts in the formation of a passive protective film of misawite (d-FeOOH), an amorphous iron oxyhydroxide that forms a barrier by adhering next to the interface between metal and rust. Misawite, the initial corrosion-resistance agent, was thus named because of the pioneering studies of Misawa and co-workers on the effects of phosphorus and copper and those of alternating atmospheric conditions in rust formation.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most critical corrosion-resistance agent is iron hydrogen phosphate hydrate (FePO4-H3PO4-4H2O) under its crystalline form and building up as a thin layer next to the interface between metal and rust. Rust initially contains iron oxide/oxyhydroxides in their amorphous forms. Due to the initial corrosion of metal, there is more phosphorus at the metalÿscale interface than in the bulk of the metal. Alternate environmental wetting and drying cycles provide the moisture for phosphoric-acid formation. Over time, the amorphous phosphate is precipitated into its crystalline form (the latter being therefore an indicator of old age, as this precipitation is a rather slow happening). The crystalline phosphate eventually forms a continuous layer next to the metal, which results in an excellent corrosion resistance layer.[2] In 1,600 years, the film has grown just one-twentieth of a millimetre thick.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1969, in his first book, Chariots of the Gods?, Erich von D?niken cited the absence of corrosion on the Delhi pillar and the unknown nature of its creation as evidence of extraterrestrial visitation.[36] When informed by an interviewer, in 1974, that the column was not in fact rust-free, and that its method of construction was well-understood, von D?niken responded that he no longer considered the pillar or its creation to be a mystery.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nBalasubramaniam states that the pillar is \\"a living testimony to the skill of metallurgists of ancient India\\". An interview with Balasubramaniam and his work can be seen in the 2005 article by the writer and editor Matthew Veazey.[39] Further research published in 2009 showed that corrosion has developed evenly over the surface of the pillar.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was claimed in the 1920s that iron manufactured in Mirjati near Jamshedpur is similar to the iron of the Delhi pillar.[41] Further work on Adivasi (tribal) iron by the National Metallurgical Laboratory in the 1960s did not verify this claim.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nA significant indentation on the middle section of the pillar, approximately 4?m (13?ft) from the current courtyard ground level, has been shown to be the result of a cannonball fired at close range.[43]  The impact caused horizontal fissuring of the column in the area diametrically opposite to the indentation site, but the column itself remained intact. While no contemporaneous records, inscriptions, or documents describing the event are known to exist, historians generally agree that Nadir Shah is likely to have ordered the pillar's destruction during his invasion of Delhi in 1739, as he would have considered a Hindu temple monument undesirable within an Islamic mosque complex.[44]  Alternatively, he may have sought to dislodge the decorative top portion of the pillar in search of hidden precious stones or other items of value.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo additional damage attributable to cannon fire has been found on the pillar, suggesting that no further shots were taken. Historians have speculated that ricocheting fragments of the cannonball may have damaged the nearby Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque  which is known to have suffered damage to its southwestern portion during the same period  and the assault on the pillar might have been abandoned as a result.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 283128.76N 77116.25E? / ?28.5246556N 77.1850694E? / 28.5246556; 77.1850694","input":"What is the mehrauli pillar in the complex of qutub minar primarily famous for?"},{"output":"about 9 days after ovulation","context":"In humans, implantation is the stage of pregnancy at which the already fertilized egg adheres to the wall of the uterus. At this stage of prenatal development, the conceptus is a blastocyst. It is by this adhesion that the fetus receives oxygen and nutrients from the mother to be able to grow.\\r\\nIn humans, implantation of a fertilized ovum is most likely to occur about 9 days after ovulation, ranging between 6 and 12 days.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reception-ready phase of the endometrium of the uterus is usually termed the \\"implantation window\\" and lasts about 4 days. The implantation window follows around 6 days after the peak in luteinizing hormone levels. With some disparity between sources, it has been stated to occur from 7 days after ovulation until 9 days after ovulation,[2] or days 6-10 postovulation.[3] On average, it occurs during the 20th to the 23rd day after the last menstrual period.[4]\\r\\nThe implantation window is characterized by changes to the endometrium cells, which aid in the absorption of the uterine fluid. These changes are collectively known as the plasma membrane transformation and bring the blastocyst nearer to the endometrium and immobilize it. During this stage the blastocyst can still be eliminated by being flushed out of the uterus. Scientists have hypothesized that the hormones cause a swelling that fills the flattened out uterine cavity just prior to this stage, which may also help press the blastocyst against the endometrium.[5] The implantation window may also be initiated by other preparations in the endometrium of the uterus, both structurally and in the composition of its secretions.\\r\\nTo enable implantation, the uterus goes through changes in order to be able to receive the conceptus.\\r\\nThe endometrium increases thickness, becomes vascularized and its glands grow to be tortuous and boosted in their secretions. These changes reach their maximum about 7 days after ovulation.\\r\\nFurthermore, the surface of the endometrium produces a kind of rounded cells, which cover the whole area toward the uterine cavity. This happens about 9 to 10 days after ovulation.[6] These cells are called decidual cells, which emphasises that the whole layer of them is shed off in every menstruation if no pregnancy occurs, just as leaves of deciduous trees. The uterine glands, on the other hand, decrease in activity and degenerate already 8 to 9 days[6] after ovulation in absence of pregnancy.\\r\\nThe decidual cells originate from the stromal cells that are always present in the endometrium. However, the decidual cells make up a new layer, the decidua. The rest of the endometrium, in addition, expresses differences between the luminal and the basal sides. The luminal cells form the zona compacta of the endometrium, in contrast to the basalolateral zona spongiosa, which consists of the rather spongy stromal cells.[6]\\r\\nDecidualization succeeds predecidualization if pregnancy occurs. This is an expansion of it, further developing the uterine glands, the zona compacta and the epithelium of decidual cells lining it. The decidual cells become filled with lipids and glycogen and take the polyhedral shape characteristic for decidual cells.\\r\\nIt is likely that the blastocyst itself makes the main contribution to this additional growing and sustaining of the decidua. An indication of this is that decidualization occurs at a higher degree in conception cycles than in nonconception cycles.[6] Furthermore, similar changes are observed when giving stimuli mimicking the natural invasion of the embryo.[6]\\r\\nThe decidua can be organized into separate sections, although they have the same composition.\\r\\nAfter implantation the decidua remains, at least through the first trimester.[6] However, its most prominent time is during the early stages of pregnancy, during implantation. Its function as a surrounding tissue is replaced by the definitive placenta. However, some elements of the decidualization remain throughout pregnancy.[6]\\r\\nThe compacta and spongiosa layers are still observable beneath the decidua in pregnancy. The glands of the spongiosa layer continue to secrete during the first trimester, when they degenerate. However, before that disappearance, some glands secrete unequally much. This phenomenon of hypersecretion is called the Arias-Stella phenomenon,[6] after the pathologist Javier Arias-Stella.\\r\\nPinopodes are small, finger-like protrusions from the endometrium. They appear between day 19 and day 21[6] of gestational age. This corresponds to a fertilization age of approximately 5 to 7 days, which corresponds well with the time of implantation. They only persist for 2 to 3 days.[6] The development of them is enhanced by progesterone but inhibited by estrogens.\\r\\nPinopodes endocytose uterine fluid and macromolecules in it. By doing so, the volume of the uterus decreases, taking the walls closer to the embryoblast floating in it. Thus, the period of active pinocytes might also limit the implantation window.[6]\\r\\nPinopodes continue to absorb fluid, and removes most of it during the early stages of implantation.\\r\\nsecreted by the endometrial glands[6]\\r\\nalpha-2-globulin (alpha-2-PEG)\\r\\n(PAPP-A)\\r\\nNot only the lining of the uterus transforms, but in addition, the secretion from its epithelial glands changes. This change is induced by increased levels of progesterone from the corpus luteum. The target of the secretions is the embryoblast, and has several functions on it.\\r\\nThe embryoblast spends approximately 72 hours[6] in the uterine cavity before implanting. In that time, it cannot receive nourishment directly from the blood of the mother, and must rely on secreted nutrients into the uterine cavity, e.g. iron[6] and fat-soluble vitamins.[6]\\r\\nIn addition to nourishment, the endometrium secretes several steroid-dependent proteins,[6] important for growth and implantation. Cholesterol[6] and steroids[6] are also secreted. Implantation is further facilitated by synthesis of matrix substances, adhesion molecules and surface receptors for the matrix substances. When the sperm nucleus and the egg nucleus have fused together, they form a zygote\\r\\nImplantation is initiated when the blastocyst comes into contact with the uterine wall.\\r\\nTo be able to perform implantation, the blastocyst first needs to get rid of its zona pellucida. This process can be called \\"hatching\\".\\r\\nLytic factors in the uterine cavity, as well as factors from the blastocyst itself are essential for this process. Mechanisms in the latter are indicated by that the zona pellucida remains intact if an unfertilized egg is placed in the uterus under the same conditions.[6] A substance probably involved is plasmin. Plasminogen, the plasmin precursor, is found in the uterine cavity, and blastocyst factors contribute to its conversion to active plasmin. This hypothesis is supported by lytic effects in vitro by plasmin.[6] Furthermore, plasmin inhibitors also inhibit the entire zona hatching in rat experiments.[6]\\r\\nThe very first, albeit loose, connection between the blastocyst and the endometrium is called the apposition.[6]\\r\\nOn the endometrium, the apposition is usually made where there is a small crypt in it, perhaps because it increases the area of contact with the rather spherical blastocyst.\\r\\nOn the blastocyst, on the other hand, it occurs at a location where there has been enough lysis of the zona pellucida to have created a rupture to enable direct contact between the underlying trophoblast and the decidua of the endometrium.[6] However, ultimately, the inner cell mass, inside the trophoblast layer, is aligned closest to the decidua. Nevertheless, the apposition on the blastocyst is not dependent on if it is on the same side of the blastocyst as the inner cell mass. Rather, the inner cell mass rotates inside the trophoblast to align to the apposition.[6] In short, the entire surface of the blastocyst has a potential to form the apposition to the decidua.\\r\\nThe identity of the molecules on the trophoblast and the endometrial epithelia that mediate the initial interaction between the two remain unidentified. However, a number of research groups have proposed that MUC1, a member of the Mucin family of glycosylated proteins, is involved.[7] MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed at the apical surface of endometrial epithelial cells during the window of implantation in humans and has been shown to be differentially expressed between fertile and infertile subjects during this time.[7] MUC1 displays carbohydrate moieties on its extracellular domain that are ligands of L-selectin, a protein expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells.[8] An in vitro model of implantation developed by Genbacev et al., gave evidence to support the hypothesis that L-selectin mediates apposition of the blastocyst to the uterine epithelium by interacting with its ligands.[9]\\r\\nAdhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.\\r\\nThe trophoblasts adhere by penetrating the endometrium, with protrusions of trophoblast cells.\\r\\nThere is massive communication between the blastocyst and the endometrium at this stage. The blastocyst signals to the endometrium to adapt further to its presence, e.g. by changes in the cytoskeleton of decidual cells. This, in turn, dislodges the decidual cells from their connection to the underlying basal lamina, which enables the blastocyst to perform the succeeding invasion.[6]\\r\\nThis communication is conveyed by receptor-ligand-interactions, both integrin-matrix and proteoglycan ones.\\r\\nAnother ligand-receptor system involved in adhesion is proteoglycan receptors, found on the surface of the decidua of the uterus. Their counterparts, the proteoglycans, are found around the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst. This ligand-receptor system also is present just at the implantation window.[6]\\r\\nInvasion is an even further establishment of the blastocyst in the endometrium.\\r\\nThe protrusions of trophoblast cells that adhere into the endometrium continue to proliferate and penetrate into the endometrium. As these trophoblast cells penetrate, they differentiate to become a new type of cells, syncytiotrophoblast. The prefix syn- refers to the transformation that occurs as the boundaries between these cells disappear to form a single mass of many cell nuclei (a syncytium). The rest of the trophoblasts, surrounding the inner cell mass, are hereafter called cytotrophoblasts.\\r\\nInvasion continues with the syncytiotrophoblasts reaching the basal membrane beneath the decidual cells, penetrating it and further invading into the uterine stroma. Finally, the whole embryo is embedded in the endometrium. Eventually, the syncytiotrophoblasts come into contact with maternal blood and form chorionic villi. This is the initiation of forming the placenta.\\r\\nThe blastocyst secretes factors for a multitude of purposes during invasion. It secretes several autocrine factors, targeting itself and stimulating it to further invade the endometrium.[6] Furthermore, secretions loosen decidual cells from each other, prevent the embryo from being rejected by the mother, trigger the final decidualization and prevent menstruation.\\r\\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin is an autocrine growth factor for the blastocyst.[6] Insulin-like growth factor 2,[6] on the other hand, stimulates the invasiveness of it.\\r\\nThe syncytiotrophoblasts dislodges decidual cells in their way, both by degradation of cell adhesion molecules linking the decidual cells together as well as degradation of the extracellular matrix between them.\\r\\nCell adhesion molecules are degraded by syncytiotrophoblast secretion of Tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This inhibits the expression of cadherins and beta-catenin.[6] Cadherins are cell adhesion molecules, and beta-catenin helps to anchor them to the cell membrane. Inhibited expression of these molecules thus loosens the connection between decidual cells, permitting the syncytotrophoblasts and the whole embryo with them to invade into the endometrium.\\r\\nThe extracellular matrix is degraded by serine endopeptidases and metalloproteinases. Examples of such metalloproteinases are collagenases, gelatinases and stromelysins.[6] These collagenases digest Type-I collagen, Type-II collagen, Type-III collagen, Type-VII collagen and Type-X collagen.[6] The gelatinases exist in two forms; one digesting Type-IV collagen and one digesting gelatin.[6]\\r\\nThe embryo differs from the cells of the mother, and would be rejected as a parasite by the immune system of the mother if it didn't secrete immunosuppressive agents. Such agents are Platelet-activating factor, human chorionic gonadotropin, early pregnancy factor, immunosuppressive factor, Prostaglandin E2, Interleukin 1-alpha, Interleukin 6, interferon-alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor and Colony-Stimulating Factor.\\r\\nFactors from the blastocyst also trigger the final formation of decidual cells into their proper form. In contrast, some decidual cells in the proximity of the blastocyst degenerate, providing nutrients for it.[6]\\r\\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) not only acts as an immunosuppressive,[6] but also \\"notifies\\" the mother's body that she is pregnant, preventing menstruation by sustaining the function of the corpus luteum.\\r\\nOther factors secreted by the blastocyst are;\\r\\nImplantation failure is considered to be caused by inadequate uterine receptivity in two-thirds of cases, and by problems with the embryo itself in the other third.[11]\\r\\nInadequate uterine receptivity may be caused by abnormal cytokine and hormonal signaling as well as epigenetic alterations.[12] Recurrent implantation failure is a cause of female infertility. Therefore, pregnancy rates can be improved by optimizing endometrial receptivity for implantation.[12] Evaluation of implantation markers may help to predict pregnancy outcome and detect occult implantation deficiency.[12]\\r\\nLuteal support is the administration of medication, generally progestins, for the purpose of increasing the success rate of implantation and early embryogenesis, thereby complementing the function of the corpus luteum.\\r\\nIn women with more than 3 implantation failures in assisted reproduction, a review of several small randomized controlled studies estimated that the use of adjunct low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) improves live birth rate by approximately 80%.[13]","input":"When does an embryo attach to the uterus?"},{"output":"November 2004","context":"Abbey National plc was a bank based in the United Kingdom and former building society, which latterly traded under the Abbey brand name. As the former Abbey National Building Society, it was the first building society in the United Kingdom to demutualise, doing so in July 1989. The bank expanded through a number of acquisitions in the 1990s, including James Hay, Scottish Mutual, Scottish Provident and the rail leasing company Porterbrook. Abbey National launched an online bank, Cahoot, in June 2000.\\r\\nIn September 2003, the bank rebranded as Abbey, and in November 2004, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Spanish Santander Group, with a rebrand following in February 2005. In January 2010, the savings business of Bradford & Bingley was combined with the bank, and Abbey National plc was renamed Santander UK plc.[1] Prior to the takeover, Abbey National plc was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Freehold Land Society, officially named the National Permanent Mutual Benefit Building Society to give it legal existence under the Building Societies Act 1836, was established by two Liberal members of parliament, Sir Joshua Walmsley and Richard Cobden, in 1849, joined a year later by John Bright. In 1856, it formed the British Land Company, which separated in 1878. Meanwhile, the Abbey Road & St. John's Wood Permanent Benefit Building Society was founded in 1874, based in a Baptist church on Abbey Road in Kilburn.\\r\\nIn 1932, the society moved into new headquarters, Abbey House, at 219ÿ229 Baker Street, London, which it occupied until 2002. The site was thought to include 221B Baker Street, the fictional home of Sherlock Holmes,[2][3] and for many years Abbey employed a secretary charged with answering mail sent to Holmes at that address.\\r\\nThe Abbey National Building Society was formed following the merger in 1944 of what had become Abbey Road Building Society (already the second largest) and National Building Society (at the time the sixth largest). The Swansea Thrift Permanent transferred engagements in 1949, followed by the Definite Permanent in 1968, The State Building Society in 1970, Highgate Building Society in 1974 and the Oak Co-operative in 1979.[4]\\r\\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Abbey National gained a reputation for innovation and, sometimes disruptive, change. It was an early user of computer systems and in the late 1970s, all branches became on-line to a real-time system that maintained customer accounts. Under Chief general manager Clive Thornton, new types of savings accounts were introduced as well as a cheque account.\\r\\nThe administration of the cheque account was restricted by building society rules and the need to find a partner that could clear Abbey's cheques (The Co-operative Bank). Later, Abbey became a full member of the Bankers' Automated Clearing Services (BACS) and the former Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS). Thornton also acted to break the building societies' interest rate consensus.\\r\\nThe Abbey National Building Society became the first of the United Kingdom building societies to demutualise, and became a public limited company as Abbey National plc on 12 July 1989. It was floated on the London Stock Exchange at S1.30 per share, resulting in an unusually large number of small shareholders ÿ approximately 1.8 million initially.\\r\\nThe demutualisation process was marred by the discovery of a large number of undelivered share certificates awaiting destruction at a contractor's premises. Abbey National shares peaked at more than S14 in 2000, before the stock market began a long decline.[5]\\r\\nIn July 1994, Abbey National purchased James Hay, one of the United Kingdom's foremost independent providers of self-administered pensions.[6] James Hay then went on to grow in straight[clarification needed] and launched Abbey Wrap, the first Wrap a service in which IFAs can keep the clients' ISAs, PEPs, Offshore bonds, and SIPP in one place. Abbey Wrap Managers was FSA approved in August 2003. This was relaunched as James Hay Wrap in June 2005.[7]\\r\\nIn February 1995, Abbey National Baring Derivatives were taken down along with Barings Bank, due to failures in regulation and control, especially in regards to Nick Leeson of Barings Bank. Two life assurance companies were demutualised and acquired, Scottish Mutual in 1992 and Scottish Provident in 2001, which enabled Abbey to pursue the bancassurance model.[8]\\r\\nIn August 1996, Abbey National took over the National & Provincial Building Society, which was itself the product of a 1982 merger between the Provincial Building Society and the Burnley Building Society. This merger increased Abbey National's branch network by almost two hundred branches and brought in three million more customers.[9]\\r\\nIn April 2000, Abbey bought Porterbrook from Stagecoach Group for S773 million. Porterbrook was one of the three railway rolling stock operating companies created from by the privatisation of British Rail, leasing rolling stock to the train operating companies in the United Kingdom.[10]\\r\\nThe bank launched its online bank, Cahoot, in June 2000.[11]\\r\\nLloyds TSB attempted to merge with the bank in July 2001, though that was ultimately rejected by the Competition Commission.[12] Abbey also ventured into the wholesale loans business. At first this provided a good profit stream, despite the criticisms of some analysts. This eventually undid the company, however, when Enron turned out to be unsafe and the 11 September attacks in New York damaged confidence in various financial areas. From this point, Abbey struggled from financial losses and a tarnished image. The chief executive, Ian Harley, a long-time Abbey employee, resigned and his post was filled by an outsider, Luqman Arnold.[13]\\r\\nArnold spearheaded a major reorganisation of the bank in September 2003 that also saw the brand name shortened to Abbey, the abbey.com domain name launched and the Abbey National umbrella logo dropped. Banking literature was also simplified as part of the programme, labelled 'turning banking on its head'.[14][15]\\r\\nOn 26 July 2004 Abbey National plc and Banco Santander Central Hispano, SA announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended acquisition by Banco Santander of Abbey. Following shareholders' approval at the EGMs of Abbey (95 per cent voted in favour, despite vocal opposition from most of those present) and Santander, the acquisition was formally approved by the courts and Abbey became part of the Santander Group on 12 November 2004.[16]\\r\\nFrancisco G܇mez Roldn took over as chief executive from Luqman Arnold, who received a rumoured S5 million, made up of pay off and share options. G܇mez-Roldn died suddenly in July 2006, three weeks before being succeeded by Antonio Horta Osorio.[17]\\r\\nIn June 2006, Abbey agreed to sell its life businesses to Resolution plc.[18] The businesses sold to Resolution were Scottish Mutual Assurance, Scottish Provident Limited and Abbey National Life, two offshore life companies, Scottish Mutual International and Scottish Provident International Life Assurance Limited. Abbey retained all of its branch based investment and asset management business, James Hay, Abbey's self-invested personal pension company and James Hay Wrap.\\r\\nIn July 2007, Abbey admitted that errors that it made in the 1980s have contributed to many borrowers mortgage terms being extended by up to 15 years. During this period?ÿ which saw considerable turbulence in interest rates?ÿ Abbey extended the terms on customers repayment style mortgages without their knowledge. The Financial Ombudsman Service stated that Abbey customers may be eligible for compensation.[19]\\r\\nAs a result of the 2008 banking crisis, Abbey purchased the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley in September 2008 following the nationalisation of B&B by HM Government.[20] The purchase of Alliance & Leicester by Santander had been agreed earlier that month.[21]\\r\\nAbbey migrated all customer accounts to the Partenon computer software used by Santander in June 2008.[22]\\r\\nOn 27 October 2008 Abbey reached an agreement to sell Porterbrook to a consortium of Deutsche Bank, Lloyds TSB and Antin Infrastructure Partners.[23]\\r\\nThe Santander Group announced in May 2009 that Abbey and the Bradford & Bingley branch network would be renamed under the Santander brand on 11 January 2010. Credit cards issued by Abbey were the first to change to Santander.[1] The Abbey name was retained for the Abbey for Intermediaries mortgage division and was retained for a time for Abbey International before the latter was subsequently rebranded as Santander Private Banking.\\r\\nThe Cater Allen, James Hay and Cahoot brands remained.[24] Santander UK plc also retained the name Abbey National Treasury Services ltd (\\"ANTS\\") for the division responsible for managing its liquidity, risk management and wholesale banking needs.[25]\\r\\nAbbey's registered office was in London (built on the site of the former Thames Television studios in Euston Road) and its main corporate centre in Milton Keynes. Its savings and banking administration departments were in Bradford, with mortgage centres in Thornaby-on-Tees and Whiteley (which was due to close later in 2010).[26] Abbey had Banking Contact Centres in Belfast, Glasgow, Sheffield, and Bootle. Business Banking operations, both administrative and telephony, were also based in Glasgow, having been moved from Taunton and Newport early in 2005.\\r\\nAbbey previously operated contact centres in Derby, Liverpool and Gateshead. The Derby and Liverpool centres were closed as part of a cost-cutting exercise. Those jobs moved to Bangalore and Pune in India in 2003. Following the takeover by the Santander Group, the Gateshead operations also closed in March 2005.\\r\\nInvestments were previously branded as Inscape but were renamed Premium Investments in late 2008, provided by Santander Portfolio Management.[27] This was subsequently subsumed into the more general telephony operations and the original contact centre based in Billericay was closed in April 2009.","input":"When was abbey national taken over by santander?"},{"output":"Sixty","context":"The NBA draft is an annual event dating back to 1947 in which the (now thirty) teams from the National Basketball Association (NBA) can draft players who are eligible and wish to join the league. These are typically college basketball players, but international players are also eligible to be drafted. College players who have finished their four-year college eligibility are automatically eligible for selection, while the underclassmen have to declare their eligibility and give up their remaining college eligibility. International players who are at least 22 years old are automatically eligible for selection, while the players younger than 22 have to declare their eligibility. Players who are not automatically eligible but have declared their eligibility are often called \\"early-entrants\\" or \\"early-entry candidates\\". The draft usually takes place at the end of June, during the NBA offseason. Since 1989, the draft has consisted of two rounds; this is much shorter than the entry drafts of the other major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, all of which run at least seven rounds. Sixty players are selected in each draft. No player may sign with the NBA until he has been eligible for at least one draft.[1]\\r\\nIn the past, high school players were also eligible to be selected. However, starting in the 2006 draft, high school players were not eligible to enter the draft directly after graduating from high school. The rules now state that high school players will gain eligibility for draft selection one year after their high school graduation, and they must also be at least 19 years old as of the end of the calendar year of the draft. Some players have chosen to use that year to play professionally overseas for example, such as Brandon Jennings (Italy), Emmanuel Mudiay (China), and Terrance Ferguson (Australia). Thon Maker was eligible for the 2016 draft despite not going to college because he chose to undertake a postgraduate year, so he was technically one year removed from graduation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome players must be at least 19 years of age during the calendar year of the draft, and a player who completed basketball eligibility at an American high school must also be at least one year removed from the graduation of his high school class. Restrictions exist on players signing with sports agents and on declaring for, then withdrawing, from draftsalthough most of them are enforced by the NCAA rather than the NBA. There had been only 44 draftees from high school to college to play in the NBA throughout this process. Any players who are not an \\"international player\\", must be at least one year out of the graduation of his high school class in order for them to qualify for the upcoming draft. Not many high school players went directly to the NBA draft for almost 20 years after Darryl Dawkins in 1975 because of the exposure of the college games.\\r\\nIn the early years of the draft, teams would select players until they ran out of prospects. The 1960 and 1968 drafts went 21 rounds. By 1974, it had stabilized to 10 rounds, which held up until 1985, when the draft was shortened to seven rounds. By agreement with the National Basketball Players Association, the drafts from 1989 onward have been limited to two rounds, which gives undrafted players the chance to try out for any team.[2]\\r\\nFrom 2009 through 2015, the college underclassmen had until the day before the April signing period to withdraw their name from the draft and retain NCAA eligibility. Beginning in 2016, players could enter the draft and participate in the NBA Draft Combine multiple times and retain NCAA eligibility by withdrawing from the draft within 10 days after the end of the mid-May NBA draft combine.[3]\\r\\nThe NBA Draft Lottery is an annual event held by the NBA, where the teams who did not make the playoffs in the past year participate in a state-lottery style process in order to determine the first three picks of the draft.[4] The team with the worst record receives the best odds of receiving the first pick. The NBA introduced the lottery process in 1985. The league was attempting to counter accusations that certain teams were purposefully losing in order to gain a chance to participate in the annual coin flip, where the worst team in each division flips a coin to see who will receive the first pick in the upcoming draft.[5]\\r\\nIn the current lottery system, the league uses \\"a lottery-style ping-pong ball machine with 14 balls numbered 1-14, and 1,000 four-digit combinations are assigned to the 14 lottery teams.\\"[4] The worst team receives 250 combinations, the second worst getting 199, the third worst team 156, and so on.[4] After the first three draft picks are determined, the rest of the teams are ordered in reverse order based on their record in the previous season.\\r\\nThe lottery is generally held in the third or fourth week of May. The NBA goes to great lengths in order to keep the selection process both fair and not tampered with in any way. \\"The actual Lottery procedure will take place in a separate room just prior to the national broadcast on ESPN. Select media members, NBA officials and representatives of the participating teams and the accounting firm of Ernst & Young will be in attendance for the drawing.\\"[6] Attendees aren't allowed cell phone or any other electronic access until the number one pick is revealed on the television broadcast.[4]\\r\\nThe NBA draft has been dominated by collegiate players since the draft was put in place in 1950. In more recent years high school seniors have also had a large impact on the draft. These include players like Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Kevin Garnett, Dwight Howard, Tracy McGrady and Amar'e Stoudemire. However, because of the new age requirement put in place in 2005, high school seniors are no longer eligible for the draft, unless they were declared as postgraduates by the NBA, which would not happen until 2015 with Indian prospect Satnam Singh Bhamara in the second round and again in 2016 with South SudaneseÿAustralian prospect Thon Maker in the first round.\\r\\nForeign players have made a large impact on how teams are now drafting. When the draft began, foreign players were not selected. As the years progressed, things began to change and a few international players were selected. The first foreign player, in the sense of being a national of a country other than the U.S., to be chosen first overall in the draft was Bahamian Mychal Thompson in 1978. However, Thompson's selection was not a true harbinger of the game's globalization, as he had spent much of his childhood in Florida, and had played college basketball at Minnesota. Thompson has three sons, one is NBA champion, Klay Thompson. One of the first foreign players selected in the draft to play in the NBA was Manute Bol out of the Sudan in 1983 in the 5th round by the San Diego Clippers. Bol's selection was later deemed ineligible by the NBA. Two years later Bol was drafted again by the NBA this time out of Division II University of Bridgeport in 1985 as the 31st pick overall in the second round. Although Bol did not have a stellar career, he is known for being one of the tallest players ever to play the game at 7 feet and 7 inches. He holds the record for being the tallest player ever to hit a 3-point field goal. The following two years saw two players born outside the U.S. selected first overallNigerian Hakeem Olajuwon in 1984 and Jamaica-born American Patrick Ewing in 1985. However, like Thompson before them, both had played U.S. college basketballOlajuwon at Houston and Ewing at Georgetownand Ewing had also played high school basketball in the U.S.\\r\\nBy the 1999 draft, the number of foreign players being drafted dramatically increased. The top pick in the 1997 NBA draft, Tim Duncan, became the third international player picked number 1 overallalthough his designation as \\"international\\" is a matter of semantics, as he is a native of the United States Virgin Islands and, like all USVI natives, is a U.S. citizen by birth. He also had played U.S. college basketball at Wake Forest. Including Duncan, 12 international players were selected in the two rounds of the draftalthough half of them, including Duncan and the next two such players picked, had played college basketball. The 1998 draft saw another foreign player picked first overall, Nigerian Michael Olowokandi, but like Duncan he had played college basketball, in his case at Pacific. In 2001 the highest drafted foreign player, Pau Gasol, was selected 3rd overall by the Atlanta Hawks. That would all change the following season when Yao Ming became the first foreign player without U.S. college experience to be selected number 1 overall. Not only was the first overall pick an international player, but five more picks in the first round alone were also from overseas. In total, the 2002 draft produced 17 international players, with only three of them (all second-round picks) having U.S. college experience.\\r\\nAs noted earlier, four international players had gone first overall before 2002, although all had played college basketball in the U.S., and one of them was in fact a U.S. citizen by birth. It was not until 2002 that an international player without college experience went first overallYao Ming. His selection was not only a watershed moment for the NBA, but it also had a large impact in Yao's homeland of China. Hannah Beech (2003) wrote \\"Yao has single-handedly transformed his countrymen from nameless, faceless millions into mighty men who can jam with the very best\\".[7] Yao has helped the NBA grow into a worldwide product. Beech (2003) goes on to write \\"Ratings for NBA games broadcast on Chinese TV have never been higher than this year as the nation keeps track of its new favorite team, Yao's Houston Rockets\\".[7] For his career Yao averaged a solid 19.0 points per game, 9.2 rebounds per game, 1.89 blocks per game, and shot 82.6 percent from the free throw line. It had later gotten to a point where the last four drafts from 2013ÿ2016 all held international prospects as #1 selections in their respective drafts before ending the run in 2017.\\r\\nThe 2002, 2005, 2006, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 NBA drafts saw international players picked first overall. In 2002, the Houston Rockets selected Yao Ming from China first in the draft. In 2005, the Milwaukee Bucks picked Andrew Bogut, from Australia by way of the University of Utah, #1. The next year, the Toronto Raptors drafted Andrea Bargnani from Italy, making him the second foreign player without U.S. college experience and the first European to be selected number 1 overall. In 2013, the Cleveland Cavaliers selected Anthony Bennett, who played at UNLV, first overall and making Bennett the first Canadian to be drafted at #1. In the 2014 NBA draft, the Cleveland Cavaliers, again picking #1, selected Canadian shooting guard/small forward Andrew Wiggins. During the 2015 NBA draft, the Minnesota Timberwolves selected American / Dominican Center Karl-Anthony Towns as the first player from the Dominican Republic to become the #1 selection, teaming up with Andrew Wiggins in the process. During the 2016 NBA draft, the Philadelphia 76ers selected Australian Forward Ben Simmons to be the #1 selection, the first time the franchise got one in 20 years since the 1996 NBA draft when they selected the first overall pick Allen Iverson, a sophomore from Georgetown.\\r\\nSome of the most noted NBA draft years are 1984, 1996, and 2003. Each of those is often referred to as one of, if not the, best NBA draft ever. The 2003 NBA draft is now considered the best draft in the last 15 years, with superstars such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh headlined. The 2000 NBA draft has been regarded as the worst in history, with Sports Illustrated calling its first round \\"a horrible group of players\\".[8] The 1986 Draft was notable for the number of solid and even outstanding players selected in later rounds, partly because of drug problems that claimed the life of second overall pick Len Bias and affected the careers of several other first-round picks.[9][10]\\r\\nThe NBA draft has been televised since 1980, the same year the NFL and NHL televised (or publicized) theirs. USA Network broadcast the draft as part of its contract with the NBA until 1984; starting in 1985, TBS did so as part of its NBA on TBS package. From 1990 to 2002, TNT took over the draft as more NBA properties moved to the network (the NBA on TNT). When ESPN acquired the rights to the NBA from NBC in 2002, ESPN began broadcasting the draft (starting in 2003) with the NBA on ESPN, which it continues to do today.\\r\\n1961\\r\\n1966\\r\\n1967\\r\\n1968\\r\\n1970\\r\\n1974\\r\\n1980\\r\\n1988\\r\\n1989\\r\\n1995\\r\\n2004","input":"How many players does the nba draft each year?"},{"output":"Iron Man","context":"Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures.1 It is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was directed by Jon Favreau, with a screenplay by the writing teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway. It stars Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub, and Gwyneth Paltrow. In Iron Man, Tony Stark, an industrialist and master engineer, builds a powered exoskeleton and becomes the technologically advanced superhero Iron Man.\\r\\nThe film had been in development since 1990 at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, or New Line Cinema at various times, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2006. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures as its distributor. Favreau signed on as director, aiming for a naturalistic feel, and he chose to shoot the film primarily in California, rejecting the East Coast setting of the comics to differentiate the film from numerous superhero films set in New York City-esque environments. Filming began in March 2007 and concluded in June. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armors, created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character.\\r\\nIron Man premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in theaters on May 2, 2008. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $585 million and garnering widespread critical acclaim. Downey's performance as Tony Stark was particularly praised. The American Film Institute selected the film as one of the ten best of the year. It was also nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. Two sequels, Iron Man 2 and Iron Man 3, were released on May 7, 2010, and May 3, 2013, respectively.\\r\\nGenius, billionaire, and playboy Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his father, is in war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to demonstrate the new \\"Jericho\\" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by one of his own company's rocket-propelled grenades. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings; Yinsen, a fellow captive who is a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but Tony and Yinsen agree Raza will not keep his word.\\r\\nStark and Yinsen quietly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a suit of powered armor to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. Obadiah Stane, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit, as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest. Personal assistant Pepper Potts places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, Stark keeps his work to himself because he is suspicious of his company.\\r\\nAt a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter Christine Everhart informs Stark that his company's weapons, including the Jericho, were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark then learns that Stane has been arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and is staging a coup to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is shot at by two F-22 Raptor fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit reverse engineered from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Pepper to hack into its database. She discovers Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged. Potts meets with Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D., an intelligence agency, to inform him of Stane's activities.\\r\\nStane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane, but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed \\"Iron Man\\".\\r\\nIn a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury visits Stark at home, telling him that Iron Man is not \\"the only superhero in the world\\", and explaining that he wants to discuss the \\"Avenger Initiative\\".\\r\\nAdditionally, Faran Tahir appears as Raza, the leader of the Ten Rings; Paul Bettany voices J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark's personal AI system; Leslie Bibb portrays Christine Everhart, a reporter for Vanity Fair; and Clark Gregg appears as Phil Coulson, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D..[19] Will Lyman provides the voiceover during the opening award ceremony.[20] Director Jon Favreau plays Happy Hogan, Stark's bodyguard and chauffeur,[7] and Samuel L. Jackson makes a cameo appearance as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., in a post-credits scene.[21] Jackson's face was previously used as the model for the Ultimate Marvel imprint version of Nick Fury.[22] Other cameos in the film include Stan Lee as himself, being mistaken for Hugh Hefner by Stark at a party;[23] Tom Morello, who provided guitar music for the film, as a terrorist guard;[24] and Jim Cramer as himself.[25] Ghostface Killah had a cameo in a scene where Stark briefly stays in Dubai, but the scene was cut from the theatrical release for pacing reasons.[26]\\r\\nIn April 1990, Universal Studios bought the rights to develop Iron Man for the big screen,[27] with Stuart Gordon to direct a low-budget film based on the property.[9] By February 1996, 20th Century Fox had acquired the rights from Universal.[28] In January 1997, Nicolas Cage expressed interest in portraying the character,[29] while in September 1998, Tom Cruise expressed interest in producing as well as starring in an Iron Man film.[30] Jeff Vintar and Iron Man co-creator Stan Lee co-wrote a story for Fox, which Vintar adapted into a screenplay. It included a new science-fiction origin for the character, and featured MODOK as the villain. Tom Rothman, President of Production at Fox, credited the screenplay with finally making him understand the character. In May 1999, Jeffrey Caine was hired to rewrite Vintar and Lee's script.[31] That October, Quentin Tarantino was approached to write and direct the film.[32] Fox sold the rights to New Line Cinema the following December, reasoning that although the Vintar/Lee script was strong, the studio had too many Marvel superheroes in development, and \\"we can't make them all.\\"[33]\\r\\nBy July 2000, the film was being written for New Line by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio,[31][35] and Tim McCanlies.[36] McCanlies' script used the idea of a Nick Fury cameo to set up his own film.[31] In June 2001, New Line entered talks with Joss Whedon, a fan of the character, to direct,[37] and in December 2002, McCanlies had turned in a completed script.[38] In December 2004, the studio attached director Nick Cassavetes to the project for a target 2006 release.[39] Screenplay drafts were written by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and David Hayter, and pitted Iron Man against his father Howard Stark, who becomes War Machine. After two years of unsuccessful development, and the deal with Cassavetes falling through, New Line Cinema returned the film rights to Marvel.[40]\\r\\nIn November 2005, Marvel Studios worked to start development from scratch,[41] and announced Iron Man as their first independent feature, as the character was their only major one not already depicted in live action.[6] According to associate producer Jeremy Latcham, \\"we went after about 30 writers and they all passed\\", saying they were uninterested in the project due to both the relative obscurity of the character and it being a solely Marvel production. Even the rewrites when the film had a script led to many refusals.[42] In order to build awareness for Iron Man from the general public, and put him on the same level of popularity as Spider-Man or Hulk, Marvel conducted focus groups to help remove the general perception that the character was a robot. After the groups proved successful, the information Marvel received helped them formulate an awareness-building plan, which included releasing three animated short films ahead of the film's release. The shorts were called \\"Iron Man Advertorials\\", and were produced by Tim Miller and Blur Studio.[43]\\r\\nJon Favreau was hired to direct the film in April 2006,[44] celebrating getting the job by going on a diet, losing 70 pounds (32?kg).[9] Favreau had wanted to work with Marvel producer Avi Arad on another film after they both worked on Daredevil.[6] The director found the opportunity to create a politically ambitious \\"ultimate spy movie\\" in Iron Man, citing inspiration from Tom Clancy, James Bond, and RoboCop,[45] and compared his approach to an independent film\\"[i]f Robert Altman had directed Superman\\"and Batman Begins.[6][46] Favreau wanted to make Iron Man a story of an adult man literally reinventing himself after discovering the world is far more complex than he originally believed.[47] He changed the Vietnam War origin of the character to Afghanistan, as he did not want to do a period piece.[10] Art Marcum & Matt Holloway were hired to write the script,[44] while Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby wrote another version, with Favreau compiling both teams' scripts,[48] and John August then \\"polishing\\" the combined version.[49] Comic book staff Mark Millar, Brian Michael Bendis, Joe Quesada, Tom Brevoort, Axel Alonso, and Ralph Macchio were also called upon by Favreau to give advice on the script.[50]\\r\\nFavreau planned to cast a newcomer in the title role, as \\"those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star. The success of X-Men and Spider-Man without being star-driven pieces reassures [executives] that the film does have an upside commercially.\\"[51] However, in September 2006, Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the role.[52] Favreau chose Downey, a fan of the comic,[3] because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining \\"The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark.\\"[3] Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take no for an answer, saying, \\"It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [and] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways.[53] While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by Elon Musk. Downey said, \\"Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.\\"[54]\\r\\nAdditional casting for the film occurred over the next few months: Terrence Howard was announced in the role of Stark's best friend Jim Rhodes in October 2006;[55] Gwyneth Paltrow was cast as love interest Virginia \\"Pepper\\" Potts in January 2007;[56] and Jeff Bridges was cast in an undisclosed role in February.[57] Choosing a character to be the villain of the film was difficult, as Favreau felt Iron Man's archnemesis the Mandarin would not feel realistic, especially after Mark Millar gave his opinion on the script.[50] He felt only in a sequel, with an altered tone, would the fantasy of the Mandarin's rings be appropriate.[58] The decision to push him into the background is comparable to Sauron in The Lord of the Rings,[46] or Palpatine in Star Wars.[58] Favreau also wanted Iron Man to face a giant enemy. The switch from Mandarin to Obadiah Stane was done after Bridges was cast in that role,[26] with Stane originally intended to become a villain in the sequel.[50] The Crimson Dynamo was also a villain in early drafts of the script.[7] Favreau felt it was important to include intentional inside references for fans of the comics, such as giving the two fighter jets that attack Iron Man the call signs of \\"Whiplash 1\\" and \\"Whiplash 2\\", a reference to the comic book villain Whiplash, and including Captain America's shield in Stark's workshop.[59]\\r\\nFavreau wanted the film to be believable by showing the construction of the Iron Man suit in its three stages.[10] Stan Winston, a fan of the comic book, and his company, who Favreau worked with on Zathura, built metal and rubber versions of the armors.[14] The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts. The back is less armored than the front, because Stark would use his resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stane's armor. A single 90-pound (41?kg) version was built, causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed. The armor was also designed to only have its top half worn at times.[14] Stan Winston Studios built a 10-foot (3.0?m), 800-pound (360?kg) animatronic version of \\"Iron Monger\\" (Obadiah Stane),[14] a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a gimbal to simulate walking.[14] A scale model was used for the shots of it being built.[26] The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps.[26] Iron Man comic book artist Adi Granov designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders.[60] Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau's MySpace page.[46] Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions,[14] and also designed the War Machine armor, but it was \\"cut from the script about halfway through pre-production.\\" He explained that the War Machine armor \\"was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor,\\" and that it \\"would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence.\\"[61]\\r\\nProduction was based in the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California.[62] Howard Hughes was one of the inspirations for the comic book, and the filmmakers acknowledged the coincidence that they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark III where the Hughes H-4 Hercules was built.[14] Favreau rejected the East Coast setting of the comic books because many superhero films had already been set there.[10]\\r\\nFilming began on March 12, 2007,[63] with the first few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan.[64] The cave where Stark is imprisoned was a 150-to-200-yard (140ÿ180?m) long set, which had movable forks in the caverns to allow greater freedom for the film's crew.[10] Production designer J. Michael Riva saw footage of a Taliban fighter in Afghanistan, and saw the cold breath as he spoke: realizing remote caves are actually very cold, Riva placed an air conditioning system in the set. He also sought Downey's advice about makeshift objects in prison, such as a sock being used to make tea.[14] Afterwards, Stark's capture was filmed at Lone Pine, and other exterior scenes in Afghanistan were filmed at Olancha Sand Dunes, where the crew endured two days of 40-to-60-mile-per-hour (64ÿ97?km/h) winds.[14] Filming at Edwards Air Force Base began in mid-April,[65] and ended on May 2.[66] Exterior shots of Stark's home were digitally added to footage of Point Dume in Malibu,[26] while the interior was built at Playa Vista, where Favreau and Riva aimed to make Stark's home look less futuristic and more \\"grease monkey\\".[14] Filming concluded on June 25, 2007, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada.[67] Favreau, a newcomer to action films, remarked, \\"I'm shocked that I [was] on schedule. I thought that there were going to be many curveballs\\". He hired \\"people who are good at creating action\\", so \\"the human story [felt] like it belongs to the comic book genre\\".[9]\\r\\nThere was much improvisation in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had focused on the story making sense and planning the action). Favreau felt that improvisation would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted to try something new each time.[26] It was Downey's idea to have Stark hold a news conference on the floor,[9] and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon.[4] Bridges described this approach as \\"a $200 million student film\\", and noted that it caused stress for Marvel executives when the stars were trying to come up with dialogue on the day of filming scenes. He also noted that in some instances, he and Downey would swap characters for rehearsal to see how their own lines sounded.[68] The dialogue for the Nick Fury cameo scene was also changed on set, with comic writer Brian Michael Bendis providing three pages of dialogue for the part, and the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming on set.[50] The Nick Fury cameo was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep it a secret, but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige subsequently had the scene removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing.[69]\\r\\nFavreau's main concern with the film's effects was whether the transition between the computer-generated and practical costumes would be too obvious.[70] He hired Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to create the bulk of the visual effects for the film after seeing Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and Transformers. The Orphanage and The Embassy did additional work,[14] with the latter creating a digital version of the Mark I armor.[71] To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a motion capture suit,[14] and skydivers were filmed in a vertical wind tunnel to study the physics of flying.[72] For shots of the Mark III flying, it was animated to look realistic by taking off slowly, and landing quickly. To generate shots of Iron Man and the F-22 Raptors battling, cameras were flown in the air to provide reference for physics, wind and frost on the lenses.[73]\\r\\nComposer Ramin Djawadi had been a fan of the character Iron Man as a child, saying that he always liked superheroes \\"that actually dont have any superpowers\\". After Favreau's previous collaborator John Debney was unavailable to score the film,[74] Djawadi sought out the role himself.[75] Favreau had a clear vision of heavy metal music and guitars for the project,[75] saying that Tony Stark was more of a rock star than a traditional superhero.[76] Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra.[75] Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from Hans Zimmer and Remote Control Productions,[75] and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who makes a cameo appearance in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score.[24] The film also features a big band-style arrangement of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon The Marvel Super Heroes from frequent Favreau collaborators John O'Brien and Rick Boston.[77] A soundtrack featuring Djawadi's score was released by Lions Gate Records on April 29, 2008.[78]\\r\\nThe premiere was held at the Greater Union theater at George Street, Sydney, on April 14, 2008.[79] The film was released in the United States on May 2, 2008,[80] while the international release was pushed to April 30, 2008.[81]\\r\\nMarvel and Paramount modeled their marketing campaign for Iron Man on that of Transformers.[82] In May 2008, Sega released an official tie-in video game based on the film on multiple gaming platforms. Downey, Howard and Taub reprise their roles from the film.[83] A 30-second spot for the film aired during a Super Bowl XLII break.[84] 6,400 7-Eleven stores in the United States helped promote the film, and LG Group also made a deal with Paramount.[82] Hasbro created figures of armors from the film, as well as Titanium Man (who appears in the video game) and the armor from the World War Hulk comics.[85] Worldwide, Burger King and Audi promoted the film. Jon Favreau was set to direct a commercial for the fast-food chain, as Michael Bay did for Transformers.[82] In the film, Tony Stark drives an Audi R8, and also has an \\"American cheeseburger\\" from Burger King after his rescue from Afghanistan, as part of the studio's product placement deal with the respective companies. Three other vehicles, the Audi S6 sedan, Audi S5 sports coupe and the Audi Q7 SUV, also appear in the film.[86][87] Audi created a tie-in website, as General Motors did for Transformers.[82] Oracle Corporation also promoted the film on its site.[88] Several tie-in comics were released for the film.[89]\\r\\n The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on September 30, 2008, in North America, and October 27, 2008 in Europe.[90] DVD sales were very successful, selling over 4 million copies the first week and generating a gross of over US$93 million.[91][92] There were a total of 9 million copies sold and an accumulated total sales of over $160 million (not including Blu-ray).[91] For the home releases of the film, the image on the newspaper Stark reads before he announces he is Iron Man had to be altered because of amateur photographer Ronnie Adams filing a lawsuit against Paramount and Marvel for using his on-location spy photo in the scene.[93] A Wal-Mart-exclusive release included a preview of Iron Man: Armored Adventures.[94]\\r\\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled \\"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One ÿ Avengers Assembled\\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[95] It was released on April 2, 2013.[96]\\r\\nIron Man earned $318.4 million in North America and $266.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $585.2 million.[2]\\r\\nIn its opening weekend, Iron Man grossed $98,618,668 in 4,105 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking No. 1 at the box office,[97] giving it the eleventh biggest-opening weekend at the time,[98] ninth-widest release in terms of theaters,[99] and the third highest-grossing opening weekend of 2008 behind Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and The Dark Knight. It grossed $35.2 million on its first day, giving it the thirteenth biggest-opening day at the time.[100] Iron Man had the second-best premiere for a non-sequel, behind Spider-Man, and the fourth biggest-opening for a superhero film.[101] Iron Man was also the No. 1 film in the U.S. and Canada in its second weekend, grossing $51.1 million,[97] giving it the twelfth-best second weekend and the fifth-best for a non-sequel.[102] On June 18, 2008, Iron Man became that year's first film to pass the $300 million mark for the domestic box office.[103][104]\\r\\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 94% approval rating with an average rating of 7.7/10 based on 268 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"Director Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey Jr. make this smart, high impact superhero movie one that even non-comics fans can enjoy.\\"[105] In May 2008, Rotten Tomatoes review aggregator Jen Yamato identified Iron Man as the \\"best-reviewed film of the year so far\\".[106] On Metacritic, the film achieved an average score of 79 out of 100, based on 38 critics, signifying \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[107]\\r\\nAmong the major trade journals, Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film an \\"expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza\\" with \\"fresh energy and stylistic polish\\",[108] while Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film, while nonetheless finding \\"disappointment [in] a climatic [sic] battle between different Iron Man prototypes [...] how did Tony's nemesis learn how to use the suit?\\"[109] In one of the first major-daily newspaper reviews, Frank Lovece of Newsday lauded the film's \\"emotional truth [...] pitch-perfect casting and plausibly rendered super-science\\" that made it \\"faithful to the source material while updating it ÿ and recognizing what's made that material so enduring isn't just the high-tech cool of a man in a metal suit, but the human condition that got him there\\".[110] A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film \\"an unusually good superhero picture. Or at least ÿ since it certainly has its problems ÿ a superhero movie that's good in unusual ways.\\"[111] Among the specialty press, Garth Franklin of Dark Horizons commended the \\"impressive sets and mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CG\\", and said, \\"Robert Downey Jr., along with director Jon Favreau [...] help this rise above formula. The result is something that, whilst hardly original or groundbreaking, is nevertheless refreshing in its earnestness to avoid dark dramatic stylings in favor of an easy-going, crowd-pleasing action movie with a sprinkle of anti-war and redemption themes\\".[112]\\r\\nAmong major metropolitan weeklies, David Edelstein of New York magazine called the film \\"a shapely piece of mythmaking [...] Favreau doesn't go in for stylized comic-book frames, at least in the first half. He gets real with it ÿ you'd think you were watching a military thriller\\",[113] while conversely, David Denby of The New Yorker put forth a negative review, claiming \\"a slightly depressed, going-through-the-motions feel to the entire show [...] Gwyneth Paltrow, widening her eyes and palpitating, can't do much with an antique role as Stark's girl Friday, who loves him but can't say so; Terrence Howard, playing a military man who chases around after Stark, looks dispirited and taken for granted\\".[114] IGN's Todd Gilchrist recognized Downey as \\"the best thing\\" in a film that \\"functions on autopilot, providing requisite story developments and character details to fill in this default 'origin story' while the actors successfully breathe life into their otherwise conventional roles\\".[115] Noting the cultural elements of the film, Cristobal Giraldez Catalan of Bright Lights Film Journal wrote, \\"Iron Man is far more than playboy fantasy; it is American foreign policy realized without context [... and] with narrative and directorial precision, once again provides the high-fidelity misogyny and anti-Muslim rhetoric Hollywood is known for.\\"[116]\\r\\nRoger Ebert and Richard Corliss named Iron Man as among their favorite films of 2008.[136][137] It was selected by the American Film Institute as one of the ten best films of the year,[138] and by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[139] Tony Stark was also selected by Empire as one of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time,[140] and on their list of the 100 Greatest Fictional Characters, Fandomania.com ranked him at number 37.[141]\\r\\nA sequel written by Justin Theroux and released in the United States on May 7, 2010, saw Favreau, Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson returning. Don Cheadle replaced Terrence Howard in the role of Colonel Rhodes, who is also seen as War Machine. Also starring are Mickey Rourke as villain Ivan Vanko, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, and Scarlett Johansson as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Natasha Romanoff.\\r\\nDisney, Marvel Studios, and Paramount Pictures released a second sequel on May 3, 2013,[142] with Favreau opting to direct Magic Kingdom instead, but still reprising his role as Happy Hogan.[143] Downey, Paltrow, and Cheadle also return, while Shane Black took over directing,[144] from a screenplay by Drew Pearce.

Lucas hired Star Wars original trilogy veteran script writer Lawrence Kasdan to write the script. However when Kasdan left to help finish the script for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, he left his son Jon Kasdan who had been unofficially helping him, in charge of finishing the script for Solo until his return.[29] In February 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed the development of two Star Wars standalone films, each individually written by Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg.[30] Shortly after, it was reported that Disney was working on two films featuring Han Solo and Boba Fett.[31] Disney CFO Jay Rasulo described the standalone films as origin stories.[32] Kathleen Kennedy explained that the standalone films would not crossover with the films of the sequel trilogy, stating, \\"George [Lucas] was so clear as to how that works. The canon that he created was the Star Wars saga. Right now, Episode VII falls within that canon. The spin-off movies, or we may come up with some other way to call those films, they exist within that vast universe that he created. There is no attempt being made to carry characters (from the standalone films) in and out of the saga episodes. Consequently, from the creative standpoint, it's a roadmap that George made pretty clear.\\"[33] In April 2015, Lucasfilm and Kennedy announced that the standalone films would be referred to as the Star Wars Anthology series.[34][35]\\r\\nIn July 2015, Lucasfilm announced that an Anthology film, focusing \\"on how [a] young Han Solo became the smuggler, thief, and scoundrel whom Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi first encountered in the cantina at Mos Eisley\\",[36] would be released on May 25, 2018.

Kennedy would serve as a producer on the film, with Lawrence Kasdan and Jason McGatlin executive producers;[1] Allison Shearmur and Simon Emanuel also produce.[6] The Han Solo project was separate from a film that was originally being developed by Josh Trank, which was pushed back to an unconfirmed date.[37] Solo's friend, the Wookiee, Chewbacca, would also appear in the film.[38][39] In May 2016, Lawrence Kasdan stated that filming would start in January 2017.[40]\\r\\nIn January 2016, a shortlist of actors was revealed for the role of young Han Solo, including Miles Teller, Ansel Elgort, Dave Franco, Jack Reynor, Scott Eastwood, Logan Lerman, Emory Cohen and Blake Jenner.[41] In March 2016, it was reported that Alden Ehrenreich, Reynor and Taron Egerton were on a shortlist of actors considered for the young Han Solo role.[42] In May 2016, Ehrenreich was reported to have been cast as the young Han Solo,[9] and was revealed in the role at Star Wars Celebration: Celebration Europe III two months later.[10] Miller called casting the role one of \\"the hardest casting challenges of all time\\" adding they \\"saw over 3,000 people for the part\\".[43]\\r\\nBy the following October, Tessa Thompson, Naomi Scott, Zo? Kravitz, Emilia Clarke, Kiersey Clemons, Jessica Henwick and Adria Arjona were being considered for the female lead,[44][45] while Donald Glover was being considered to play a young Lando Calrissian.[44] Glover was confirmed for Calrissian shortly after,[18] with Clarke cast as the female lead the following month.[46][45]\\r\\nIn early January 2017, Woody Harrelson was revealed to be in negotiations to portray Han Solo's mentor,[47] and was confirmed to be appearing in the film shortly after.[12] Christian Bale had previously been in discussions for the role.[48] A subsequent interview with Harrelson bolstered speculation that he may be specifically playing Star Wars Legends character Garris Shrike,[49][50] but Harrelson revealed the character's name as Beckett in March 2017.[13] In February 2017, Phoebe Waller-Bridge joined the cast in an undisclosed role, said to be \\"a CGI-driven performance\\" similar to Alan Tudyk in Rogue One as the droid K-2SO.[19] Additionally, it was reported that Thandie Newton was in negotiations to star in the film.[51] Waller-Bridge and Newton were confirmed as being cast by the end of February, alongside the announcement that Joonas Suotamo would appear as Chewbacca, reprising the role from Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi that he shared with original Chewbacca actor Peter Mayhew.[6] Michael K. Williams entered talks to join the film in early March 2017,[52] and was confirmed shortly after,[20] portraying a half-human, half-animal creature.[21] By the end of the month, Ian Kenny had joined the cast.[25] Warwick Davis was confirmed as part of the cast by the end of July 2017.[26]\\r\\nFilming began on January 30, 2017,[53] at Pinewood Studios,[43] under the working title Star Wars: Red Cup.[53] Lucasfilm announced that principal photography started on February 20, 2017.[6] Bradford Young serves as the cinematographer for the film.[54] In May 2017, filming moved to the Canary Islands, and Lucasfilm replaced editor Chris Dickens with Pietro Scalia. Lucasfilm also hired an acting coach for Ehrenreich, as they were unhappy with his performance up to that point.[7]\\r\\nOn June 20, 2017, citing \\"creative differences\\", Lucasfilm and Lord and Miller jointly announced their intent to part ways, with a new director \\"to be announced soon\\".[2][55] It was reported that the directors were fired after Kennedy and Kasdan disagreed with their shooting style;[3][56] Lord and Miller believed they were hired to make a comedy film, while Lucasfilm was looking for the duo to add \\"a comedic touch\\" to the space fantasy. Lucasfilm also felt that the directors were encouraging too much improvisation from the actors, which was believed to be \\"shifting the story off-course\\" from the Kasdans' script.[57] To appease Kasdan, who was unhappy with scenes not being filmed \\"word for word... Lord and Miller would do several takes exactly as written and then shoot additional takes.\\"[7] Lord and Miller refused to compromise on the way to approach certain scenes, such as filming a scene from fewer angles than what Lucasfilm was expecting reducing the options available in editing, leading to a strained relationship with Lucasfilm.[57][7] The duo were also unhappy when Kasdan was brought to the London set, feeling he became a \\"shadow director\\".[7] The decision to remove Lord and Miller from the project was made after a short hiatus in filming taken to review the footage. Additional weeks of filming had been planned.[3]\\r\\nIt was reported that Star Wars creator George Lucas's close friend Ron Howard, who previously had turned down an offer from Lucas himself to direct Star Wars: Episode I ÿ The Phantom Menace,[58] was a frontrunner to step in as director. Joe Johnston and Kasdan were also being considered, though Directors Guild of America rules state that a replacement for a director may not be someone already involved in the production.[56][59] Two days later, it was announced that Howard would take over directing duties for the remaining three-and-a-half weeks of scheduled principal photography as well as the scheduled five weeks of reshoots.[4][60] On being hired, Howard wrote, \\"I'm beyond grateful to add my voice to the Star Wars Universe... I hope to honor the great work already done & help deliver on the promise of a Han Solo film.\\"[61] Howard was expected to arrive in London on June 26 to complete filming.[7] During the film's reshoots, actor Michael K. Williams was unable to return to the production, due to a schedule conflict with filming The Red Sea Diving Resort, resulting in his part being cut. Williams stated the reshoots for his character were \\"to match the new direction which the producers wanted Ron to carry the film in\\", and that he would not have been available again until November 2017, and the production did not want to wait for his availability in order to still be able to release in May 2018.[21]\\r\\nLucas, a friend and mentor of Howard due to previous collaborations, made a surprise visit to the set to encourage his friend on his first day shooting. While originally meant as a short meeting, Lucas ended up spending the whole day with the crew. While Lucas did not mean to interfere, at some point he forgot and asked \\"Why doesn't Han just do this?\\". Upon hearing Lucas' suggestion, Howard decided to film it and include it in the film.[62] On October 17, 2017, Howard announced that principal photography had been completed; he also revealed the official title of the film as Solo: A Star Wars Story.[63]\\r\\nIn March 2018, it was announced that the original directors Lord and Miller will receive executive producer credits on the film.[5]\\r\\nIn July 2017, John Powell was announced as the main composer of the film's score.[64] Longtime Star Wars composer John Williams will contribute the Han Solo theme for the film.[65]\\r\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story will have its premiere on May 15, 2018 at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.[66] The film is scheduled to be released in the United States on May 25, 2018, the 41st anniversary of Star Wars: Episode IV?ÿ A New Hope in which Harrison Ford first appeared as Han Solo. Despite the firing of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, Lucasfilm has maintained that the film is on schedule for its intended release date.[1][2]\\r\\nA \\"sneak peek\\" TV spot was released during Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018.[67] It became the most popular Super Bowl trailer on YouTube with 8 million views. It also had 5.9 million views on Facebook.[68]\\r\\nThe first official teaser trailer was released in February 5, 2018. Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the trailer as \\"dull\\", and compared it negatively to the look of Rogue One, opining that the visuals \\"should be the hive of scum and villainy of the Cantina of the very first movie, filled with colorful aliens and things happening all over the place. That busyness, the sense of danger and hustle, feels appropriate for Solo in a way that what's on show in this first trailer simply doesn't.\\" He also noted that several plot elements presented in the trailer were reminiscent of The Han Solo Trilogy, a series of novels published in 1997 and 1998.[69]\\r\\nIn early March 2018, French artist Hachim Bahous asserted that Disney had plagiarized a series of album covers he designed for Sony Music's label Legacy Recordings in France with character posters for the film. Disney stated they were investigating the alleged plagiarism and that the Solo posters had been produced by an outside vendor.[70]","input":"When was solo a star wars story announced?"},{"output":"Cubism","context":"","input":"What style of painting did salvador dali use?"},{"output":"Mel Giedroyc","context":"Anna Beattie (2010ÿ)\\r\\nRichard McKerrow (2010)\\r\\nThe Great British Bake Off, often referred to as Bake Off or GBBO, is a British television baking competition produced by Love Productions, in which a group of amateur bakers compete against each other in a series of rounds, attempting to impress a group of judges with their baking skills, with a contestant being eliminated in each round, with the winner being selected from the remaining contestants that make it to the finals. The show's first episode was aired on 17 August 2010, with its first four series broadcast on BBC Two, until its growing popularity led the BBC to move it to BBC One for the next three series. After its seventh series, Love Productions signed a three-year deal with Channel 4 to produce the show for the broadcaster.[1][2]\\r\\nThe programme was originally presented by Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc, with Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood the judges. The current presenters are Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig with Hollywood and Prue Leith on the judging panel.[3] In chronological order, the winners are Edd Kimber, Joanne Wheatley, John Whaite, Frances Quinn, Nancy Birtwhistle, Nadiya Hussain, Candice Brown and Sophie Faldo.\\r\\nThe show has become a significant part of British culture and is credited with reinvigorating interest in baking throughout the United Kingdom, with many of its participants, including winners, having gone on to start a career based on bakery, while the BAFTA award-winning programme has spawned a number of specials and spin-off shows ÿ a celebrity charity series in aid of Sport Relief or Comic Relief; Junior Bake Off for young children (broadcast on the CBBC channel); after-show series An Extra Slice; and Bake Off: Crme de la Crme for teams of professional pastry chefs.[4] The show's format was used as the basis for two BBC Two series, The Great British Sewing Bee and The Great Pottery Throw Down, and, in addition to the show being shown in other countries (in the United States and Canada, the show is referred to as The Great British Baking Show), the format has also been sold to many countries around the world where local versions of the show are produced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of the baking competition was conceived by producer Anna Beattie after she spoke to a friend who had seen 'bake-offs' in America.[5] Beattie was also inspired by village fete baking competitions; she said: \\"I loved that idea of village fetes and an old-fashioned baking competition with people who only wanted to bake a good cake.\\"[6] However, Beattie failed to interest any channel in the idea for four years. In early 2009, they pitched the idea to Janice Hadlow, the then controller of BBC Two.[7] The pitch was successful, and Hadlow and the Commissioning Editor Charlotte Moore commissioned the programme,[8][9] which was then developed over the next six months. The development team first selected Mary Berry as a judge, and following an audition Paul Hollywood was also appointed. Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc were approached to be presenters of the show.[7]\\r\\nOn 17 August 2010, the first episode of The Great British Bake Off was shown on BBC Two.[10] It stayed on BBC Two for four years, grew in popularity and become the most popular programme on that channel. In its fifth series it was moved to BBC One where it stayed for three years. It was the most-watched programme on British television in 2015 and 2016.[11][12] Following extended negotiations, Love Productions announced that the seventh series of the show would be the last broadcast by the BBC. On 12 September 2016, Love agreed to a three-year deal to broadcast the show on Channel 4.[13][14] Giedroyc and Perkins subsequently announced that they would not be returning when the show moves to its new network.[15] On 22 September, Berry announced that she would also be leaving the show when it moved to Channel 4,[16] while Hollywood later announced he would stay.[17] In March 2017, it was announced that Prue Leith would join Hollywood as judge, while Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig would take over as presenters.[18]\\r\\nThe programme operates on a weekly elimination process to find the best all-around baker from the contestants, who are all amateurs. The applicants to the show are assessed by a researcher, followed by an audition in London with two of their bakes. They then undergo a screen test and an interview with a producer. A second audition involves the applicants baking two recipes for the judges in front of the cameras.[5] Ten contestants were chosen for the first series, twelve for the following two series, thirteen for the fourth, and back to twelve from series five onwards.\\r\\nIn each episode, the amateur bakers are given three challenges: a signature bake, a technical challenge, and a show-stopper.[5] The three challenges take place over two days, and the filming takes up to 16 hours a day. The contestants are assessed by the judges who then choose a \\"Star Baker\\" for the week (introduced in series 2), and a contestant is also eliminated. In the final round, three bakers are left and a winner is chosen from the three.\\r\\nIn the first series, the location of the cast and crew moves from town to town each week, but starting from the second series, the competition is held in one location in a specially constructed marquee. Interspersed in the programme are the background of the contestants as well as video vignettes on the history of baking. What each baker intends to bake during a particular challenge is illustrated using animated graphics. These graphics have been created by illustrator Tom Hovey since the show's inception in 2010.[19][20]\\r\\nSeries 1 of The Great British Bake Off saw ten home bakers take part in a bake-off to test their baking skills as they battled to be crowned the Great British Bake Off's best amateur baker. Each week the nationwide tour saw the bakers put through three challenges in a particular discipline. The rounds took place in various locations across the UK, with the final round being held at Fulham Palace, London.\\r\\nThe three finalists were Ruth Clemens, Miranda Gore Browne, and Edd Kimber. On 21 September 2010, Edd Kimber was crowned the best amateur baker.[23]\\r\\nThe number of amateur baker contestants increased to twelve for the second series. Unlike Series 1, this year The Great British Bake Off stayed in one location ÿ Valentines Mansion, a 17th-century mansion house in Redbridge, London.\\r\\nAll the Series 2 finalists were female: Holly Bell, Mary-Anne Boermans, and the winning contestant Joanne Wheatley.[24]\\r\\nA third series of The Great British Bake Off began on 14 August 2012.[25] The series was filmed at Harptree Court in East Harptree, Somerset.\\r\\nIn contrast to Season 2, there was an all-male final. The finalists were Brendan Lynch, James Morton and John Whaite,[26] who won the final in a surprise result.[27]\\r\\nThe fourth series of The Great British Bake Off started on 20 August 2013 on BBC Two. The series was again filmed at Harptree Court in East Harptree, Somerset.[28] The all-female final was won by Frances Quinn, with Ruby Tandoh and Kimberley Wilson as runners up.[29]\\r\\nThe fifth series of The Great British Bake Off began airing on 6 August 2014 on BBC One. This series was filmed at Welford Park in Berkshire.[30] There were twelve bakers taking part. Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood returned as judges, whilst Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc continued to present the series. Richard Burr was awarded the largest number of star baker designations of any series so far, but was beaten by Nancy Birtwhistle in the final.\\r\\nA spin-off show The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice, hosted by comedian Jo Brand on BBC Two, was also launched as a companion series this year. Each episode was broadcast two days after the main show but later moved to the same night. The show includes interviews with eliminated contestants.[31]\\r\\nThe sixth series began on 5 August 2015[32] on BBC One, again from Welford Park in Berkshire. Spin-off show The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice returned for a second series, with Jo Brand as host. This series was won by Nadiya Hussain, with Ian Cumming and Tamal Ray as runners up.[33]\\r\\nThe seventh series began on 24 August 2016 on BBC One, once again from Welford Park in Berkshire, a later than usual start following the BBC's coverage of the Olympic Games.[34] This series was won by Candice Brown, with Jane Beedle and Andrew Smyth as runners up.\\r\\nThe eighth series of The Great British Bake Off began airing on 29 August 2017.[35] This is the first series of The Great British Bake Off to be broadcast on Channel 4 following its move from the BBC.[36] The series features new hosts Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig, and new judge Prue Leith along with returning judge Paul Hollywood. This series was won by Sophie Faldo, with Kate Lyon and Steven Carter-Bailey finishing as runners-up.\\r\\nAs of the sixth series, there have been four incomplete bakes.\\r\\nThe early reviews for the first series were mixed. Lucy Mangan of The Guardian wondered if \\"competitive baking [is] a contradiction in terms\\" and found the proceedings humourless.[40] Iain Hollingshead of The Daily Telegraph was scathing, describing the presenters as \\"annoying\\", the judge Paul Hollywood as looking \\"sinister without being interesting\\", and that the audience would be so bored that they \\"could certainly forgive the cameraman if he were to commit hara-kiri in a giant pool of egg and flour.\\"[41]\\r\\nHowever, reviews from the later series were more positive. Andrew Collins of The Guardian called it \\"the nicest show on television\\" and judged it the best TV programme of 2012.[42][43] Rachel Ward of The Daily Telegraph thought the programme \\"had just the right consistency of mouth-watering morsels, good humour, and fascinating history\\",[44] while Tom Sutcliffe of The Independent considered the contest \\"perfectly baked\\".[45]\\r\\nBake Off was moved to Channel 4 in 2017, and reviews of the programme on the channel were largely positive, although a few felt that it did not compare well to the BBC version.[46][47][48] Mark Lawson of The Guardian described the programme on Channel 4 as \\"both exactly the same but also just subtly different enough\\", and that \\"only someone desperate to dislike the re-plated show could argued that [it] has soured, spoiled or binned its recipe\\".[49] Michael Hogan of The Telegraph thought that while \\"Mary, Mel and Sue might be gone but the show's recipe remains as winning as ever. The four Cs ÿ chemistry, camaraderie, comedy, cakes ÿ were all present and correct.\\"[50] Anna Leszkiewicz of the New Statesman however considered that while the format had been left largely unchanged and the contestants \\"irresistibly likeable\\", \\"every single change to the show has been for the worse\\".[47]\\r\\nThe show has become a significant part of British culture and is credited with spurring an interest in home baking, with supermarkets and department stores in the UK reporting sharp rises in sales of baking ingredients and accessories.[51][52] It was also credited with reviving the Women's Institute, whose membership reached its highest level since the 1970s.[53] The show also boosted the sales of bakery books and the number of baking clubs, and independent bakeries also showed an increase. According to one analyst, more than three-fifths of adults have baked at home at least once in 2013 compared with only a third in 2011.[54]\\r\\nThe first series of The Great British Bake Off premiered in August 2010 with moderate ratings of just over 2 million viewers for its first episode.[55] This was enough to place it in BBC Two's top ten for that week, and over the series the audience grew to over three million, with the semi-final and final both achieving first place in BBC Two's weekly ratings. During the second series, the ratings gradually increased, and it became a surprise hit with nearly 4 million watching each episode.[56] Week two was the last time that the show was out-rated by another BBC Two programme in the same week (it came second to the drama Page Eight); from then until the show's move to BBC One, every competition episode would be the channel's number one rated programme of the week. By its final episode it had averaged 4.56?million viewers, peaking at 5.1?million in its last 15 minutes.[57]\\r\\nThe ratings continued to strengthen in the third series, and the show began to beat its competition in its timeslot.[58] The final of the series where John Whaite was crowned the winner saw its highest rating yet, with an average of 6.5?million viewers that peaked at 7.2?million, which made it the second highest-rated BBC Two-originated show after Top Gear since at least 2006.[59][60] The fourth series achieved some of the highest ratings seen on BBC Two. The viewer count for its premiere episode was more than two million higher than that of the previous series,[61] while the final episode was seen by 9.1?million viewers at its peak, more than twice the number of viewers on BBC One and ITV.[62] The final episode is the most-watched show on BBC Two since the present ratings system was introduced in 2002, beating the previous record set by Top Gear.[63] As a result of its high ratings, the show was moved to BBC One.[64]\\r\\nAfter its move to BBC One, the opening episode was watched by over 7 million viewers according to overnight figures, beating the figure of 5.6?million for the opening episode of the previous year.[65] A \\"sabotage\\" controversy surrounding episode four helped the show gain its biggest ever audience of 10.3?million viewers, with 2 million people who watched it on BBC iPlayer.[66] The final of the show gained an overnight viewing figure of 12.29?million, then the highest viewing figure of the year for a non-sporting event on UK TV.[67] In the following year, the top ten ratings for 2015 was also dominated by The Great British Bake Off, with seven of the year's ten most-watched television programmes being episodes of the show, topped by the final episode with 15.05?million viewers.[68] In the last series on the BBC in 2016, nine of the top ten most-watched programmes of the year were episodes of the show, with 16.03?million viewers watching the finale.[69]\\r\\nThe first series broadcast by Channel 4 opened with average viewing figures of 5.8?million, rising to 6.5?million to include those watching on Channel 4+1. Although this was the lowest figure for an opening episode since 2013, it was Channel 4's biggest overnight audience since the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Paralympics.[70] The 7-day rating for the episode was 9.46?million.[71]\\r\\nIn September 2012, production company Love Productions was sanctioned by the BBC for product placement of Smeg fridges. The issue came to light after a viewer wrote to the Radio Times complaining of \\"blatant product promotion\\". After an investigation, the BBC said Love Production's loan agreement with Smeg did not meet editorial guidelines and was being revised for the third series, and that appropriate retrospective hire payments would be made.[72] The BBC asked Smeg to remove a notice from its website promoting its association with the show, which it has since done.[73]\\r\\nDuring the fourth series, there were accusations of favouritism towards female contestants after the last man Glenn Cosby was eliminated from the show;[74] however, similar claims were not made the previous year over the all-male final, or even the year before, when there was also an all-female quarter-final. The fourth series also suffered allegations of Paul Hollywood's favouritism towards Ruby Tandoh,[75][76] and personal attacks on Tandoh by various people including the chef Raymond Blanc.[77][78][79] Both Paul Hollywood and Ruby Tandoh denied the accusation.[80][81]\\r\\nIn the fourth episode of the fifth series, there was controversy around the elimination of contestant Iain Watters. During the final showstopper round contestants were tasked with producing a Baked Alaska. Iain's ice cream was shown as having not set and in a show of frustration he threw his bake in the bin. The editing of the show suggested that another contestant, Diana Beard, had caused the failure by removing the ice cream from a freezer, and the perceived \\"sabotage\\" resulted in a furore on social media networks.[82] However, unseen footage broadcast in the accompanying programme An Extra Slice shows Luis holding the large floor freezer that contained Iain's ice cream open as he piped the sides of his own baked Alaska, while Mel warns him to pipe quickly and close the freezer. Later in the episode, when Iain removes his ice cream to begin the next step of his dish, it is still quite soft, indicating it went into the freezer he shared with Diana without being completely frozen. Various members of the cast posted comments in support of Diana[83] and a BBC spokesman later issued a statement that \\"Diana removing Iain's ice cream from the freezer for less than a minute was in no way responsible for Iain's departure.\\"[84]\\r\\nMore than 800 complaints were lodged with the BBC over the incident and some also complained to the communication watchdog Ofcom.[85]\\r\\nA number of viewers complained to the BBC feedback show Points of View in the fifth series about the \\"constant smutty remarks\\" from the presenters Mel and Sue.[86][87] This series was seen as having more innuendos than previous ones; some reviewers noted the \\"extra pinch of saucy spice\\" and \\"the increasingly filthy-minded hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins\\",[88][89][90] while the Daily Mail argued that the \\"smutty\\" innuendos made the show no longer fit for family entertainment.[91] The series 3 winner John Whaite however argued that innuendo is part of what made the show a success,[92] whilst judge Paul Hollywood described the innuendos as banter in the spirit of the Carry On films and is a part of British culture,[93] a view shared by others.[94][95]\\r\\nThe success of The Great British Bake Off led to the BBC commissioning many other series closely following the format from Love Productions for example The Great British Sewing Bee and The Great Pottery Throw Down. However the 2014 series Hair using the same format was produced in house by the BBC, Love Productions responded by making preparations to sue the BBC for infringing their copyright.[96][97] Although the matter was kept quiet, with the BBC settling out of court and compensating Love Productions,[96][97] the matter soured relations between the BBC and Love Productions.[97] In September 2016, it was announced that the BBC had lost the broadcast rights of the show to Channel 4.[98] Channel 4 offered S25?million for the show outbidding the S15?million offered by the BBC.[98] In January 2017 the BBC waived its rights to keep the program off the air until 2018, and wished the programme \\"well for the future\\".[99]\\r\\nOn 31 October 2017, judge Prue Leith accidentally revealed the winner of Series 8 on Twitter twelve hours before the finale was due to air. This caused uproar among many fans of the show. She quickly deleted the tweet and apologised to the fans who saw the tweet.[100]\\r\\nThe Great British Bake Off was nominated for a Rose d'Or in the Lifestyle section of the 2012 competition and won.[101][102] The programme has been nominated a number of times in various categories for the BAFTA awards and won in 2012, 2013, and 2016.[103][104] It also won two 2015 National Television Award for Skills Challenge Show.[105]\\r\\nThe UK version of The Great British Bake Off is broadcast in many countries and it has been sold to 196 territories as of 2015.[119] The format has also been sold to 20 territories by 2015, making it the third most successful BBC format after Dancing with the Stars (Strictly Come Dancing) and The Weakest Link.[120] Many of these shows have been successful.[121][122] The Junior Bake Off format has also been sold to Thailand.[123]\\r\\nBeginning in 2014, the US broadcaster PBS has aired several series of the show under the name The Great British Baking Show.[124] The change of name was necessary due to the fact that \\"Bake-Off\\" is a registered trademark of Pillsbury in the United States. The fifth series was broadcast as Season 1 in Winter 2014ÿ2015;[125] the fourth series was then broadcast as Season 2 in Fall 2015,[126] and the sixth series was broadcast as Season 3 in Summer 2016.\\r\\nThe CBC began broadcasting The Great British Bake Off in Canada in August 2016, starting with the sixth series and also with the Great British Baking Show title.

The team is scheduled to begin play as the Las Vegas Raiders for the 2020 National Football League (NFL) season (although a move to Las Vegas could happen as soon as 2019 with Sam Boyd Stadium), playing home games at the Las Vegas Stadium. NFL team owners voted 31ÿ1 to approve the move, which was announced at the annual league meetings in Phoenix, Arizona on March 27, 2017.[1][2] The Raiders became the third NFL franchise to relocate in the 2010s, following the Rams' move from St. Louis, Missouri to Los Angeles, California on January 12, 2016,[3] and the Chargers' move from San Diego, California to Los Angeles on January 12, 2017.[4] The Raiders' move to Las Vegas comes after years of failed efforts to renovate or replace the OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum, which has been rated by multiple sources as one of the worst stadiums in the NFL.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oakland Raiders were founded as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960. The team joined the NFL as a result of the merger in 1970. From 1966 until 1981, it played home games at the OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum, which it shared with Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics after that team moved to Oakland in 1968. In 1980 Al Davis, dissatisfied with the stadium situation in Oakland and seeing luxury boxes as the future of the NFL came to an agreement with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum commission to move the Raiders to Los Angeles. The NFL had refused to let the team move, but a court over-ruled the league, clearing the way for the Raiders to move to Los Angeles and become the Los Angeles Raiders.[7] In 1982, the Raiders (then owned by Al Davis) were approved to relocate from Oakland to Los Angeles. The Raiders played home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum from 1982 to 1994. In 1995, after being unable to secure a new stadium in the Los Angeles area and after a proposed move to Sacramento that involved Davis taking ownership of the Sacramento Kings fell apart the Raiders moved back to Oakland.[8][9]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Las Vegas had been home to a number of other professional football franchises between 1994 and the Raiders' arrival, none of which were particularly successful. The Las Vegas Posse, part of the Canadian Football League's effort to enter the U.S. market, lasted one season in 1994 and suffered from poor on-field product and worse attendance figures.[10] The XFL included the Las Vegas Outlaws in its lone 2001 season; its attendance and on-field performance were respectable, and the team embraced the city's culture,[11] but the Outlaws' modest success was overshadowed by the failure of the XFL. The Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League were a major on-field success and were one of the UFL's best teams; it nonetheless suffered from poor attendance to start that continued to decline throughout the league's existence to the point that its last home game drew only 600 fans.[12] The Arena Football League included three teams in Las Vegas over the course of its history: the Las Vegas Sting (1994 and 1995), Las Vegas Gladiators (2003 to 2007, now the Cleveland Gladiators), and another Las Vegas Outlaws (2015). The Las Vegas Sin of the Lingerie Football League (now the Legends Football League) played in the city from 2011 to 2014.\\r\\nRecent efforts to either renovate the OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum or replace it with a new football stadium in Oakland or elsewhere date back to November 18, 2009.[13] In 2011, Al Davis died and control of the team was assumed by his son Mark Davis who made finding a solution to the 3 decade long stadium problem a top priority. The Raiders were free to move after the 2013 NFL season, when its lease on the OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum expired. While exploring possible solutions in the Bay Area and potential relocation candidates, the Raiders signed one-year extensions of its lease on the Coliseum.\\r\\nThere had been discussions for the Raiders to share Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California with the San Francisco 49ers.[14] However, the 49ers went ahead without the Raiders and broke ground on the $1.2 billion stadium on April 19, 2012[15] and afterwards sold $670 million worth of seats including 70% of club and luxury suites, making it more unlikely that the Raiders would continue to explore the idea of sharing the stadium as they would then be secondary tenants with little to no commercial rights over the highly lucrative luxury suites.[16]\\r\\nMark Davis further increased the unlikelihood of the Raiders and the 49ers to share Levi's stadium when he told NFL Network reporter Ian Rapoport that he had no plans to share the stadium but that he did recognize the Raiders' need for a new home and that he hoped the new home would be in Oakland.[17] When Levi's Stadium had its grand opening on July 17, 2014, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell mentioned to the live crowd that it would make a great home for the Raiders and that it was up for the team to decide whether or not it wanted to play there or build a stadium on the site of the OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum.[18]\\r\\nOn March 7, 2012, then-mayor Jean Quan unveiled an ambitious project to the media that was designed to improve the sports facilities of all three major league sports teams in the city (the Raiders, Major League Baseball (MLB)'s Athletics and the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Golden State Warriors), as well as attract new businesses to the city. The project, dubbed Coliseum City, had entailed the redevelopment of the existing OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum complex. The redevelopment would have seen the construction of two new stadiums on the present location, a baseball-only stadium and a football-only stadium, while Oracle Arena, home of the Warriors, would have been either rebuilt or undergone extensive renovations. A sum of $3.5 million was committed to preliminary planning on the project. However, no officials from either of Oakland's major league teams were present at the media conference.\\r\\nAccording to the San Francisco Business Times, Oakland's assistant city administrator Fred Blackwell said the Bay Investment Group LLC, an entity being formed by Colony Capital LLC, Rashid Al Malik (chairman and CEO of HayaH Holdings), and the city, had numerous details to continue working out for the prospective $2 billion Coliseum City project, which covered 800 acres surrounding the OaklandÿAlameda Coliseum Complex. The development team also included JRDV Urban International, HKS Architects, and Forest City Real Estate Services. In an ideal situation, construction could have started by the end of 2014.[19] Meanwhile, the Warriors began to go forward with plans to build a new arena at Mission Bay, not far from AT&T Park, and move back across the Bay from Oakland to San Francisco as soon as 2019.\\r\\nThe abandoned Concord Naval Weapons Station, 26.6 miles from Oakland, was announced in 2013 as a possible location for a new stadium but developments failed to materialize.[20]\\r\\nIn July 2014, San Antonio, Texas, emerged as a potential relocation candidate for the team, after Raiders owner Mark Davis visited an event hosted for former Raiders wide receiver Cliff Branch in the city. San Antonio, while it was in a smaller media market than the San Francisco Bay Area, had the advantage of having a relatively new and NFL-ready stadium in the Alamodome and less sporting competition.[21] On July 29, 2014, it was reported by the San Antonio Express-News that Mark Davis met with officials from the city of San Antonio to discuss the possibility of relocating the Raiders to San Antonio after the 2014ÿ15 NFL season. Davis confirmed that he did speak with San Antonio city officials while visiting San Antonio to honor former Raiders wide receiver Cliff Branch's induction into a local Hall of Fame, but did not comment on whether he was considering relocation to San Antonio.[22] The Raiders would have played at the 65,000-seat Alamodome until a new stadium could be built. San Antonio remained in contention as a site through at least November 2014, when Raiders staffers scouted the stadium and began negotiating with San Antonio officials.[23]\\r\\nIt was reported in early 2015 that the Raiders sat down with Athletics owner Lewis Wolff in an effort to create a stadium solution where two separate stadiums (one for the Raiders and one for the Athletics) would have been built on the coliseum site. The Athletics balked at the deal.[24] In an interview with J. T. the Brick on KGMZ on April 4, 2017, Davis revealed that he offered Wolff (the owner of the Athletics) 20 percent of the Raiders in an attempt to get a deal done. Davis further elaborated that the closest that the Raiders came to a deal in Oakland was in 2013 with Colony Capital, before the Athletics agreed to a 10-year lease extension at the Coliseum with the city of Oakland.[25]\\r\\nOn February 19, 2015, the Raiders and the then San Diego Chargers announced that they would build a privately financed $1.78 billion stadium in Carson, California if they were to move back to the Los Angeles market.[26] Both teams stated that they would continue to attempt to get stadiums built in their respective cities.[27] The Carson City Council would bypass the public vote and approved the plan 3ÿ0.[28] The council voted without having clarified several issues, including who would finance the stadium, how the required three-way land swap would be performed, and how it would raise enough revenue if only one team moved in as tenant.[29] On January 12, the NFL rejected the Raiders' relocation request in favor of a competing plan by Stan Kroenke to move the then St. Louis Rams back to Los Angeles and construct a stadium and entertainment district in Inglewood, California. However, the NFL left open the possibility of the Raiders relocating to Los Angeles by 2020 and playing in the new stadium under construction to house the Los Angeles Rams. The San Diego Chargers however had the first option to join the Rams at the new stadium, the Raiders would have been authorized to negotiate an agreement if the Chargers did not exercise their option by January 2017.[30] The Chargers exercised their choice and announced their relocation to Los Angeles in January 2017, shutting the Raiders out of the Southern California market.[4]\\r\\nAround this time other markets expressed interest in luring the Raiders. For example Duluth, Minnesota submitted a proposal to construct a new stadium for the team, a proposal that was not taken seriously because of the metro area's small size, proximity to the Minnesota Vikings and unwillingness to commit money to the stadium proposal.[31]\\r\\nLess than a month after the Chargers announced their move to Los Angeles, Las Vegas had emerged as the most likely destination candidate for the Raiders.\\r\\nOn January 29, 2016, Davis met with Las Vegas Sands owner Sheldon Adelson about possibly relocating to a $2.3 billion, 65,000 capacity domed stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada. During Davis' meeting with Adelson, he also visited the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), which included a contingent consisting of the university's president Len Jessup, former university president Donald Snyder, Steve Wynn, and former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) owner Lorenzo Fertitta. The proposed stadium would replace Sam Boyd Stadium and would serve as the home of both the Raiders and the UNLV Rebels college football program. A relocation to Las Vegas would be a long-term proposal, as Sam Boyd Stadium is undersized for the NFL and there are no other professional-caliber stadiums in Nevada. Raiders officials were also in Las Vegas to tour locations in the valley for a potential new home; they were also on the 42-acre site of the proposed stadium to ask questions about the site.\\r\\nInterviewed by sports columnist Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News, Davis said that he had a \\"great\\" visit in the city he described it as interesting. Davis also said that Las Vegas was a global city and that \\"it's absolutely an NFL city,\\" as well as saying that \\"the Raider brand would do well\\" and \\"I think Las Vegas is coming along slowly.\\"[32]\\r\\nOn March 21, 2016, when asked about Las Vegas, Davis said, \\"I think the Raiders like the Las Vegas plan,\\" and \\"it's a very very very intriguing and exciting plan,\\" referring to the stadium plan in Las Vegas. Davis also met with Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval about the stadium plan. On April 1, 2016, Davis toured Sam Boyd Stadium to evaluate whether UNLV could serve as a temporary home of the team and was with UNLV football coach Tony Sanchez, athletic director Tina Kunzer-Murphy, adviser Don Snyder and school president Len Jessup to further explore the possibility of the Raiders moving to Las Vegas.\\r\\nOn April 28, 2016, Davis said he wanted to move the Raiders to Las Vegas and pledged $500 million toward the construction of a proposed $2.4 billion domed stadium.[33][34] \\"Together we can turn the Silver State into the silver and black state,\\" Davis said.[33][35]\\r\\nAt a media conference in UNLV's Stan Fulton Building, Davis also said the club had \\"made a commitment to Las Vegas at this point in time and that's where it stands.\\" In an interview with ESPN after returning from a meeting for the 2016 NFL draft he expanded upon reasons why Southern Nevada held a certain appeal over the East Bay of the OaklandÿSan Francisco Bay Area, how he tried to make it work in Oakland and why (as he told Sandoval) he hopes to turn Nevada into the \\"Silver and Black State\\"; he also spoke of the meeting saying, \\"It was a positive, well-organized presentation that I believe was well-received\\", and stating, \\"It was a very positive step in finding the Raiders a home.\\"\\r\\nOn May 20, 2016, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said he would support Davis and the Raiders move to Las Vegas, stating, \\"I think it would be good for the NFL.\\"[36]\\r\\nOn May 23, 2016, the San Francisco Chronicle and other media outlets reported that a group led by former San Francisco 49ers safety (and Pro Football Hall of Fame member) Ronnie Lott and retired quarterback Rodney Peete were looking into building a new Oakland stadium for the Raiders.[37] The group met with team executives and Oakland city officials to brief them on their proposal. They also met with mayor Libby Schaaf. The Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted to begin negotiations with Lott's group and with the city of Oakland regarding the \\"price and terms of sale\\" for the 120-acre land of the Oakland Coliseum and Oracle Arena.\\r\\nDavis publicly reiterated his commitment to his announced plans to relocate the Raiders franchise to Las Vegas, Nevada with the support of the state of Nevada and casino mogul Sheldon Adelson,[38] and said he did not wish to negotiate further with Oakland while the Las Vegas deal was still actively in progress; any relocation to Las Vegas needed to be approved by a three-quarters majority of all NFL owners, and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell publicly stated his preference for keeping the Raiders franchise in Oakland if at all possible.[39] However, it was reported that the NFL had issues with the Lott Group's financier Fortress Investment Group due to past issues the group had.\\r\\nOn August 11, 2016, Raiders' officials met with Northern Nevada officials about the possibility of Reno being the site of a new training camp/practice facility and toured several sites including the University of Nevada, Reno, Reno area high schools, and sports complexes.[40] On August 25, 2016, the Raiders filed a trademark application for \\"Las Vegas Raiders\\" on the same day renderings of a new stadium (located west of Interstate 15 at Las Vegas) were released to the public.[41]\\r\\nOn September 15, 2016, the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee unanimously voted to recommend and approve $750 million for the Las Vegas stadium plan.[42]\\r\\nOn October 11, 2016, the Nevada Senate voted 16ÿ5 to approve the funding bill for the Las Vegas stadium proposal.[43] The Nevada Assembly voted 28ÿ13 three days later to approve the bill to fund the new Las Vegas stadium proposal; two days later, Sandoval signed the funding bill into law.[44]\\r\\nDavis told ESPN on October 15, 2016 that even if the Raiders were approved by the league to relocate to the Las Vegas metropolitan area, the club would play the next two seasons at the OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum in 2017 and 2018, stating \\"We want to bring a Super Bowl championship back to the Bay Area.\\"[45] The team would then play at a temporary facility in 2019 after its lease at the Coliseum expires. Davis has also indicated a desire to play at least one preseason game in Las Vegas, at Sam Boyd Stadium, as early as the 2017 season.[39] (The Raiders' 2017 schedule has both preseason games in Oakland.)\\r\\nOn October 17, 2016, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval signed into law Senate Bill 1 and Assembly Bill 1 which approved a hotel room rate tax increase to accommodate $750 million in public funding for the new stadium.[46][47]\\r\\nOn November 12, 2016, a report from the NFL's own in-house media team outlined how Las Vegas might not be a done deal. The report stated that the majority of owners favored the Raiders staying in Oakland due to market size and stability. The vast majority of the NFL's revenue comes from TV contracts. So because of that, it made little sense for the other 31 NFL owners to vote in favor of one of their partners abandoning the 6th biggest media market for the 42nd.[48]\\r\\nOn November 30, 2016, a framework deal to keep the Raiders in Oakland was announced.[49] In addition to the public land, the city of Oakland would commit $200 million to improve the infrastructure of the surrounding area. The Raiders would contribute $500 million to the stadium, while Lott's group would contribute $400 million; the NFL already committed $300 million when it rejected the Raiders' bid to return to Los Angeles in 2015.[50] Ronnie Lott had no financial or ownership stake in the Raiders; some sources indicated that Lott was also asking for an ownership stake (reportedly around 20 percent) in the Raiders franchise as part of the deal, a condition that was unacceptable to Raiders owner Mark Davis.\\r\\nThe Oakland proposal was officially announced in December 2016,[51] and called for a $1.3 billion, football-only stadium built on the existing Coliseum site. It included mixed use development for possible office or retail space, hotel or residential living and parking, as well as 15 acres set aside for a new baseball-only facility for the Oakland Athletics if the A's so desired. The site also could have been expanded to include the land Oracle Arena sits on, with the Warriors cleared to move to their new San Francisco arena by the 2019 season.\\r\\nThe Ronnie Lott proposal was voted on by the Oakland city and Alameda County elected officials on December 13, 2016[50] and approved by Oakland in a 7ÿ0 vote and by Alameda County in a 3ÿ1 vote.[52][53]\\r\\nThe Raiders officially filed paperwork to relocate from Oakland, California, to Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 19, 2017.[54] The Raiders needed 24 of the 32 NFL club owners to vote to officially approve the move to Las Vegas.[55]\\r\\nOn January 30, 2017, it was announced that Adelson had dropped out of the stadium project, also withdrawing the Las Vegas Sands' proposed $650 million contribution from the project. Instead, the Raiders would increase their contribution from $500 million to $1.15 billion.[56] One day after Adelson's announcement, Goldman Sachs (the company behind the financing to the proposed Las Vegas stadium) announced its intent to withdraw from the project.[57]\\r\\nOn January 31, 2017, in the aftermath of Adelson and Goldman Sachs' withdrawal from the Las Vegas deal, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Mayor Kevin Faulconer reached out to an NFL official to let them know they were eager to engage; a city official also spoke to a Raiders official on the phone. The Union-Tribune noted that any possible Raiders relocation to San Diego or bringing a team to the city would have been aided by a proposal for a soccer-specific stadium and mixed development. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell reiterated, during his State of the NFL address, that San Diego would need a new stadium in order to be a relocation possibility. Another roadblock for a Raiders relocation to the city would have been the owners of the current Los Angeles teams. Stan Kroenke and Dean Spanos would block any team from sharing Southern California, especially if that team is the Raiders (given the team's continued popularity in the region). San Diego, as an option for the Raiders, was remote.\\r\\nSan Diego was previously home to the San Diego Chargers from 1961 until 2016 (when the team relocated to the Greater Los Angeles Area); a Raiders move there would have been ironic given that the team's primary rival the Chargers were based in that city. On February 16, 2017, the San Diego Union-Tribune obtained a letter from Doug Manchester that stated he had \\"assembled a powerful group of associates\\" who would develop a 70,000-seat stadium on the land of Qualcomm Stadium; the letter also stated the project would provide \\"a viable alternative\\" to the Raiders in case Las Vegas fell through; the group also stated that they were \\"open to working with the Chargers, Raiders, other NFL owners, or a new ownership group\\"; it also stated an NFL franchise could participate as a partner or tenant: \\"Our group will provide the funds previously allocated to be provided by the City of San Diego and guarantee the stadium's expeditious construction. Accordingly it will not require voter approval.\\" It also said they would provide \\"new state of the art scoreboards and upgrade Qualcomm Stadium while the new stadium is being constructed\\". On March 1, 2017, Fortress Investment Group submitted a tweaked version of the Oakland stadium plan to the NFL.\\r\\nOn March 6, 2017, the Raiders revealed that Bank of America would be replacing Sheldon Adelson's portion of the funding for the new stadium in Las Vegas.[58][59] On March 27, 2017, the National Football League officially approved the Raiders move from Oakland to Las Vegas in a 31ÿ1 vote, ensuring them a new stadium in the process.[1][2] However, even though the Raiders were approved to move to Las Vegas, the club will still play the 2017 and 2018 NFL seasons at the OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum and still be known as the Oakland Raiders as long as they play in the San Francisco Bay Area. About one thousand season ticket holders asked for and received refunds after the move to Las Vegas was announced. Their tickets were sold to other fans within hours, and the Raiders' 53,250 season tickets were all sold out by late May.[60][61]\\r\\nThe league levied a $350 million relocation fee on the Raiders, which will be paid in ten annual installments beginning in 2019. This figure is slightly more than half of the $650 million fee that the Rams and Chargers each paid to relocate to Los Angeles.[62]\\r\\nOn November 13, 2017, the Raiders officially broke ground on Las Vegas Stadium.[63][64]\\r\\nOn January 2, 2018, the Henderson city council approved the sale of 55 vacant acres of land to the Raiders for their new headquarters and practice facility near Henderson Executive Airport.[65]\\r\\nIn January, construction crews began blasting caliche rock with dynamite to excavate and create the stadium bowl.[66]\\r\\nIn season 3 of the HBO television series Ballers, which was produced in 2016 and aired in 2017, Spencer Strasmore (Dwayne Johnson) leads an effort to relocate the Raiders to Las Vegas.[67]","input":"What football team is going to las vegas?"},{"output":"plate movement","context":"The San Andreas Fault is a continental transform fault that extends roughly 1,200 kilometers (750?mi) through California.[1] It forms the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, and its motion is right-lateral strike-slip (horizontal). The fault divides into three segments, each with different characteristics and a different degree of earthquake risk. The slip rate along the fault ranges from 20 to 35?mm (0.79 to 1.38?in)/yr.[1]\\r\\nThe fault was identified in 1895 by Professor Andrew Lawson of UC Berkeley, who discovered the northern zone. It is often described as having been named after San Andreas Lake, a small body of water that was formed in a valley between the two plates. However, according to some of his reports from 1895 and 1908, Lawson actually named it after the surrounding San Andreas Valley.[2] Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Lawson concluded that the fault extended all the way into southern California.\\r\\nIn 1953, geologist Thomas Dibblee concluded that hundreds of miles of lateral movement could occur along the fault. A project called the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) near Parkfield, Monterey County, was drilled through the fault during 2004 - 2007 to collect material and make physical and chemical observations to better understand fault behavior [3].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northern segment of the fault runs from Hollister, through the Santa Cruz Mountains, epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, then up the San Francisco Peninsula, where it was first identified by Professor Lawson in 1895, then offshore at Daly City near Mussel Rock. This is the approximate location of the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The fault returns onshore at Bolinas Lagoon just north of Stinson Beach in Marin County. It returns underwater through the linear trough of Tomales Bay which separates the Point Reyes Peninsula from the mainland, runs just east of Bodega Head through Bodega Bay and back underwater, returning onshore at Fort Ross. (In this region around the San Francisco Bay Area several significant \\"sister faults\\" run more-or-less parallel, and each of these can create significantly destructive earthquakes.) From Fort Ross, the northern segment continues overland, forming in part a linear valley through which the Gualala River flows. It goes back offshore at Point Arena. After that, it runs underwater along the coast until it nears Cape Mendocino, where it begins to bend to the west, terminating at the Mendocino Triple Junction.\\r\\nThe central segment of the San Andreas Fault runs in a northwestern direction from Parkfield to Hollister. While the southern section of the fault and the parts through Parkfield experience earthquakes, the rest of the central section of the fault exhibits a phenomenon called aseismic creep, where the fault slips continuously without causing earthquakes.\\r\\nThe southern segment (also known as the Mojave segment) begins near Bombay Beach, California. Box Canyon, near the Salton Sea, contains upturned strata associated with that section of the fault.[4] The fault then runs along the southern base of the San Bernardino Mountains, crosses through the Cajon Pass and continues northwest along the northern base of the San Gabriel Mountains. These mountains are a result of movement along the San Andreas Fault and are commonly called the Transverse Range. In Palmdale, a portion of the fault is easily examined at a roadcut for the Antelope Valley Freeway. The fault continues northwest alongside the Elizabeth Lake Road to the town of Elizabeth Lake. As it passes the towns of Gorman, Tejon Pass and Frazier Park, the fault begins to bend northward, forming the \\"Big Bend\\". This restraining bend is thought to be where the fault locks up in Southern California, with an earthquake-recurrence interval of roughly 140ÿ160 years. Northwest of Frazier Park, the fault runs through the Carrizo Plain, a long, treeless plain where much of the fault is plainly visible. The Elkhorn Scarp defines the fault trace along much of its length within the plain.\\r\\nThe southern segment, which stretches from Parkfield in Monterey County all the way to the Salton Sea, is capable of an 8.1-magnitude earthquake. At its closest, this fault passes about 35 miles (56?km) to the northeast of Los Angeles. Such a large earthquake on this southern segment would kill thousands of people in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, and surrounding areas, and cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damage.[5]\\r\\nThe Pacific Plate, to the west of the fault, is moving in a northwest direction while the North American Plate to the east is moving toward the southwest, but relatively southeast under the influence of plate tectonics. The rate of slippage averages about 33 to 37 millimeters (1.3 to 1.5?in) a year across California.[6]\\r\\nThe southwestward motion of the North American Plate towards the Pacific is creating compressional forces along the eastern side of the fault. The effect is expressed as the Coast Ranges. The northwest movement of the Pacific Plate is also creating significant compressional forces which are especially pronounced where the North American Plate has forced the San Andreas to jog westward. This has led to the formation of the Transverse Ranges in Southern California, and to a lesser but still significant extent, the Santa Cruz Mountains (the location of the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989).\\r\\nStudies of the relative motions of the Pacific and North American plates have shown that only about 75 percent of the motion can be accounted for in the movements of the San Andreas and its various branch faults. The rest of the motion has been found in an area east of the Sierra Nevada mountains called the Walker Lane or Eastern California Shear Zone. The reason for this is not clear. Several hypotheses have been offered and research is ongoing. One hypothesis ÿ which gained interest following the Landers earthquake in 1992 ÿ suggests the plate boundary may be shifting eastward away from the San Andreas towards Walker Lane.\\r\\nAssuming the plate boundary does not change as hypothesized, projected motion indicates that the landmass west of the San Andreas Fault, including Los Angeles, will eventually slide past San Francisco, then continue northwestward toward the Aleutian Trench, over a period of perhaps twenty million years.\\r\\nThe San Andreas began to form in the mid Cenozoic about 30 Mya (million years ago).[7] At this time, a spreading center between the Pacific Plate and the Farallon Plate (which is now mostly subducted, with remnants including the Juan de Fuca Plate, Rivera Plate, Cocos Plate, and the Nazca Plate) was beginning to reach the subduction zone off the western coast of North America. As the relative motion between the Pacific and North American Plates was different from the relative motion between the Farallon and North American Plates, the spreading ridge began to be \\"subducted\\", creating a new relative motion and a new style of deformation along the plate boundaries. These geological features are what are chiefly seen along San Andreas Fault. It also includes a possible driver for the deformation of the Basin and Range, separation of the Baja California Peninsula, and rotation of the Transverse Range.\\r\\nThe main southern section of the San Andreas Fault proper has only existed for about 5 million years.[8] The first known incarnation of the southern part of the fault was Clemens Well-Fenner-San Francisquito fault zone around 22ÿ13 Ma. This system added the San Gabriel Fault as a primary focus of movement between 10ÿ5 Ma. Currently, it is believed that the modern San Andreas will eventually transfer its motion toward a fault within the Eastern California Shear Zone. This complicated evolution, especially along the southern segment, is mostly caused by either the \\"Big Bend\\" and/or a difference in the motion vector between the plates and the trend of the fault and it surrounding branches.\\r\\nThe fault was first identified in Northern California by UC Berkeley geology professor Andrew Lawson in 1895 and named by him after the Laguna de San Andreas, a small lake which lies in a linear valley formed by the fault just south of San Francisco. Eleven years later, Lawson discovered that the San Andreas Fault stretched southward into southern California after reviewing the effects of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Large-scale (hundreds of miles) lateral movement along the fault was first proposed in a 1953 paper by geologists Mason Hill and Thomas Dibblee. This idea, which was considered radical at the time, has since been vindicated by modern plate tectonics.[9]\\r\\nSeismologists discovered that the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield in central California consistently produces a magnitude 6.0 earthquake approximately once every 22 years. Following recorded seismic events in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966, scientists predicted that another earthquake should occur in Parkfield in 1993. It eventually occurred in 2004. Due to the frequency of predictable activity, Parkfield has become one of the most important areas in the world for large earthquake research.\\r\\nIn 2004, work began just north of Parkfield on the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD). The goal of SAFOD is to drill a hole nearly 3 kilometres (1.9?mi) into the Earth's crust and into the San Andreas Fault. An array of sensors will be installed to record earthquakes that happen near this area.[10]\\r\\nThe San Andreas Fault System has been the subject of a flood of studies. In particular, scientific research performed during the last 23 years has given rise to about 3,400 publications.[11]\\r\\nA study published in 2006 in the journal Nature found that the San Andreas fault has reached a sufficient stress level for an earthquake of magnitude greater than 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale to occur.[13] This study also found that the risk of a large earthquake may be increasing more rapidly than scientists had previously believed. Moreover, the risk is currently concentrated on the southern section of the fault, i.e. the region around Los Angeles, because massive earthquakes have occurred relatively recently on the central (1857) and northern (1906) segments of the fault, while the southern section has not seen any similar rupture for at least 300 years. According to this study, a massive earthquake on that southern section of the San Andreas fault would result in major damage to the Palm Springs-Indio metropolitan area and other cities in San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties in California, and Mexicali Municipality in Baja California. It would be strongly felt (and potentially cause significant damage) throughout much of Southern California, including densely populated areas of Los Angeles County, Ventura County, Orange County, San Diego County, Ensenada Municipality and Tijuana Municipality, Baja California, San Luis Rio Colorado in Sonora and Yuma, Arizona. Older buildings would be especially prone to damage or collapse, as would buildings built on unconsolidated gravel or in coastal areas where water tables are high (and thus subject to soil liquefaction). The paper concluded:\\r\\nThe information available suggests that the fault is ready for the next big earthquake but exactly when the triggering will happen and when the earthquake will occur we cannot tell [...] It could be tomorrow or it could be 10 years or more from now.[13]\\r\\nNevertheless, in the 11 years since that publication there has not been a substantial quake in the Los Angeles area, and two major reports issued by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have made variable predictions as to the risk of future seismic events. The ability to predict major earthquakes with sufficient precision to warrant increased precautions has remained elusive.[14]\\r\\nThe U.S. Geological Survey most recent forecast, known as UCERF3 (Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast 3), released in November 2013, estimated that an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 M or greater (i.e. equal to or greater than the 1994 Northridge earthquake) occurs about once every 6.7 years statewide. The same report also estimated there is a 7% probability that an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or greater will occur in the next 30 years somewhere along the San Andreas Fault.[15] A different USGS study in 2008 tried to assess the physical, social and economic consequences of a major earthquake in southern California. That study predicted that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake along the southern San Andreas Fault could cause about 1,800 deaths and $213 billion in damage.[16]\\r\\nA 2008 paper, studying past earthquakes along the Pacific coastal zone, found a correlation in time between seismic events on the northern San Andreas Fault and the southern part of the Cascadia subduction zone (which stretches from Vancouver Island to northern California). Scientists believe quakes on the Cascadia subduction zone may have triggered most of the major quakes on the northern San Andreas within the past 3,000 years. The evidence also shows the rupture direction going from north to south in each of these time-correlated events. However the 1906 San Francisco earthquake seems to have been the exception to this correlation because the plate movement was moved mostly from south to north and it was not preceded by a major quake in the Cascadia zone.[17]\\r\\nThe San Andreas Fault has had some notable earthquakes in historic times:","input":"What causes earthquakes in the san andreas fault?"},{"output":"Roland Garros","context":"Eugne Adrien Roland Georges Garros (French pronunciation:??[??l? a?os]; 6 October 1888 ÿ 5 October 1918) was a French pioneering aviator and fighter pilot during World War I and early days of aviation.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nEugne Adrien Roland Georges Garros[3] was born in Saint-Denis, Runion, and studied at the Lyce Janson de Sailly and HEC Paris. He started his aviation career in 1909 flying a Demoiselle (Dragonfly) monoplane, an aircraft that only flew well with a small lightweight pilot.  He gained Ae.C.F. licence no. 147 in July 1910. In 1911 Garros graduated to flying Blriot monoplanes and entered a number of European air races with this type of machine, including the 1911 Paris to Madrid air race and the Circuit of Europe (Paris-London-Paris), in which he came second.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 September 1911, he set an altitude record of 3,950?m (12,960?ft). The following year, on 6 September 1912, after Austrian aviator Philipp von Blaschke had flown to 4,360?m (14,300?ft), he regained the height record by flying to 5,610?m (18,410?ft).[5][6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1913 he had switched to flying the faster Morane-Saulnier monoplanes, and gained fame for making the first non-stop flight across the Mediterranean Sea from Frjus in the south of France to Bizerte in Tunisia[8] in a Morane-Saulnier G. The following year, Garros joined the French army at the outbreak of World War?I.\\r\\n\\r\\nReports published in August 1914 claimed Garros was involved in the \\"first air battle in world history\\" and that he had flown his plane into a Zeppelin, destroying the airship and killing its pilots and himself.[9] This story was quickly contradicted by reports that Garros was alive and well in Paris.[10] Such early reports maintained that an unidentified French pilot had indeed rammed and destroyed a Zeppelin,[10] however, German authorities denied the story.[11] Later sources indicated the first aerial victory against a Zeppelin occurred in June 1915 and that earlier reports, including that of Garros, had been discredited.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early stages of the air war in World War I the problem of mounting a forward-firing machine gun on combat aircraft was considered by a number of individuals.  The so-called \\"interrupter gear\\" did not come into use until Anthony Fokker developed a synchronization device which had a large impact on air combat; however, Garros also had a significant role in the process of achieving this goal.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a reconnaissance pilot with the Escadrille MS26, Garros visited the Morane-Saulnier Works[14] in December 1914.  Saulnier's work on metal deflector wedges attached to propeller blades was taken forward by Garros; he eventually had a workable installation fitted to his Morane-Saulnier Type L aircraft. The Aero Club of America awarded him a medal for this invention three years later.[15] Garros achieved the first ever shooting-down of an aircraft by a fighter firing through a tractor propeller, on 1 April 1915; two more victories over German aircraft were achieved on 15 and 18 April 1915.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 April 1915, either Garros's fuel line clogged or, by other accounts, his aircraft was downed by ground fire, and he glided to a landing on the German side of the lines. Garros failed to destroy his aircraft completely before being taken prisoner: most significantly, the gun and armoured propeller remained intact.[14] Legend has it that after examining the plane, German aircraft engineers, led by Fokker, designed the improved interrupter gear system. In fact the work on Fokker's system had been going for at least six months before Garros's aircraft fell into their hands.[16] With the advent of the interrupter gear the tables were turned on the Allies, with Fokker's planes shooting down many Allied aircraft, leading to what became known as the Fokker Scourge.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nGarros finally managed to escape from a POW camp in Germany on 14 February 1918, after several attempts, and rejoined the French army.[18] He settled into Escadrille 26 to pilot a Spad, and claimed two victories on 2 October 1918, one of which was confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 October 1918, he was shot down and killed near Vouziers, Ardennes, a month before the end of the war and one day before his 30th birthday.[19][2] His adversary was probably German ace Hermann Habich from Jasta 49.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nGarros is erroneously called the world's first fighter ace. In fact, he shot down only four aircraft; the definition of \\"ace\\" is five or more victories. The honour of becoming the first ace went to another French airman, Adolphe Pgoud, who had six victories early in the war.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nA tennis centre constructed in Paris in the 1920s was named after him, the Stade Roland Garros. The stadium accommodates the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments.[22]  Consequently, the tournament is officially called Les Internationaux de France de Roland-Garros (the \\"French Internationals of Roland Garros\\").[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to V? Tr?ng Ph?ng's urban novel, Dumb Luck, (1936), during colonial times the Hanoi government named the city's main tennis stadium after Roland Garros.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe international airport of La Runion, Roland Garros Airport, is also named after him.\\r\\nThere is a monument to Garros in Bizerte at the site of his landing, which is called \\"Roland Garros Plaza\\".[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French car manufacturer Peugeot commissioned a 'Roland Garros' limited edition version of its 205 model in celebration of the tennis tournament that bears his name. The model included special paint and leather interior. Because of the success of this special edition, Peugeot later created Roland Garros editions of its 106, 108, 206, 207, 208, 306, 307, 406, and 806 models.[26]","input":"Who was the roland garros tennis tournament named after?"},{"output":"T.J.

It was the site of two American Civil War battles in the campaign known as Operations Against the Defenses of Charleston in 1863, and it is considered one of the toughest beachhead defenses constructed by the Confederate army.\\r\\n\\r\\nNamed for deceased Lt. Col. Thomas M. Wagner, Fort Wagner measured 250 by 100 yards (91?m), and spanned an area between the Atlantic on the east and an impassable swamp on the west. Its walls, composed of sand and earth, rose 30 feet (9.1?m) above the level beach and were supported by palmetto logs and sandbags. The fort's arsenal included fourteen cannons, the largest a 10-inch (250?mm) Columbiad that fired a 128-pound shell. It was a large structure capable of sheltering nearly 1,000 of the fort's 1,700-man garrison and provided substantial protection against naval shelling. The fort's land face was protected by a water-filled trench, 10 feet (3.0?m) wide and 5 feet (1.5?m) deep, surrounded by buried land mines and sharpened palmetto stakes.[1]  The fort itself was supported by defenses throughout Morris Island.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Battle of Fort Wagner, occurred on July 11, 1863. Only 12 Confederate soldiers were killed, as opposed to 339 losses for the U.S. side.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Second Battle of Fort Wagner, a week later, is better known. This was the U.S. attack on July 18, 1863, led by the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, one of the first major American military units made up of black soldiers. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw led the 54th Massachusetts on foot while they charged, and was killed in the assault.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough a tactical defeat, the publicity of the battle of Fort Wagner led to further action for black U.S. troops in the Civil War, and it spurred additional recruitment that gave the U.S. Army a further numerical advantage in troops over the South.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. forces besieged the fort after the unsuccessful assault. By August 25, U.S. entrenchments were close enough to attempt an assault on the Advanced Rifle Pits, 240 yards in front of the Battery, but this attempt was defeated. A second attempt, by the 24th Mass. Inf., on August 26 was successful. After enduring almost 60 days of heavy U.S. shelling, the Confederates abandoned it on the night of September 6ÿ7, 1863. withdrawing all operable cannons and the garrison.[1][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main reason the fort was abandoned was a concern about the loss of the garrison due to artillery fire and the threat of imminent assault.  On September 6, the garrison commander, Colonel Keitt, wrote to his superiors that \\"The garrison must be taken away immediately after dark, or it will be destroyed or captured. It is idle to deny that the heavy Parrott shells have breached the walls and are knocking away the bomb-proofs. Pray have boats immediately after dark at Cummings Point to take away the men. I say deliberately that this must be done or the garrison will be sacrificed. I am sending the wounded and sick now to Cummings Point, and will continue to do so, if possible, until all are gone. I have a number of them now there. I have not in the garrison 400 effective men, including artillery. The engineers agree in opinion with me, or, rather, shape my opinion. I shall say no more.\\"  A council of war in Charleston on the 4th had already reached the same conclusion, and the evacuation was carried out as planned.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war a revisionist story arose concerning access to fresh water. The claim was made that bodies of the U.S. troops (54th Massachusetts and many white troops) were buried close to the fort and the decomposition of the bodies poisoned the fresh water well within the fort. Continuing bombardment and interception of food/water supplies by boat from Charleston made holding the fort difficult.[3] This version of the story is directly contradicted by official Confederate correspondence at the time of the evacuation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin twenty years of the Civil War, the remnants of the fort had been washed away by erosion on Morris Island. A group of three ex-servicemen traveled to the fort in May 1885 and reported that the entire fort and approaches to it had washed away into the ocean.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fall of Battery Wagner would have considerable strategic significance. With its loss and that of Fort Gregg, Morris Island too fell to the United States. Although Charleston remained in the hands of the rebels its port was effectively closed.  At the end of the year Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles could report that \\"the commerce of Charleston has ceased.\\"[6]  The impact also showed directly in rebel customs receipts, which fell drastically from 1863 to 1864.[7]  The labors and sacrifices of the United States forces during the storms and siege had in the end shut down a vital lifeline to the rebellion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most famous regiment that fought for the U.S. side in the battle of Fort Wagner was the 54th regiment, which was one of the first African-American regiments in the war. The 54th was controversial in the North, where many people supported the abolition of slavery, but still treated African-Americans as lesser or inferior to whites. Though some claimed blacks could not fight as well as whites, the actions of the 54th Massachusetts demonstrated once again the fallacy in that argument, as this was not the first time blacks ever fought in war or even for the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Carney, an African-American and a sergeant with the 54th, is considered the first black recipient of the Medal of Honor for his actions at Fort Wagner in recovering and returning the unit's American flag to U.S. lines.[1] After the battle, the Confederates buried the regiment's commanding officer, Robert Gould Shaw, in a mass grave with the African-American soldiers of his regiment, viewing this as an insult to him. Instead, his family were grateful to them for burying Shaw with his men.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorris Island is smaller than 1,000 acres and is subject to extensive erosion by storm and sea. Much of the previous site of Fort Wagner has been eroded away, including the place where the Union soldiers had been buried. However, by the time this had happened, the soldiers' remains were no longer there because soon after the end of the Civil War, the Army disinterred and reburied all the remainsincluding, presumably, those of Col. Shawat the Beaufort National Cemetery in Beaufort, South Carolina, where their gravestones were marked as \\"unknown.\\"[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Atlantic Ocean consumed Fort Wagner in the late 1800s and the original site is now offshore, the Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved 118 acres (0.48?km2) of historic Morris Island, which had gun emplacements and other military installations during the war.[9]","input":"What famous african american regiment fought bravely at fort wagner?"},{"output":"January 8, 1863","context":"","input":"When did construction of the transcontinental railroad begin?"},{"output":"sugar","context":"Andrews Liver Salts is a laxative and antacid for mild stomach complaints.

The preceding orogenies consisted of the Potomac and Taconic orogeny, which followed a rift/drift stage in the Late Neoproterozoic.[3] The Acadian orogeny involved the collision of a series of Avalonian continental fragments with the Laurasian continent. Geographically, the Acadian orogen extended from the Canadian Maritime provinces migrating in a southwesterly direction toward Alabama.[4] However, the Northern Appalachian region, from New England northeastward into Gasp region of Canada, was the most greatly affected region by the collision.[2]\\r\\nIt was roughly contemporaneous with the Bretonic phase of the Variscan orogeny of Europe, with metamorphic events in southwestern Texas and northern Mexico, and with the Antler orogeny of the Great Basin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the time of the Acadian orogeny, Middle Devonian(385 Ma), the paleolatitude of the Laurentia was in the southern hemisphere near the equator, between 0 to 30S latitude.[6] Laurentia did not change much with respect to paleolatitude during the Devonian. Gondwana, on the other hand, traveled a large distance, such that in the Ordovician the South pole was located in northern Africa, where it then moved west of southern Chile during the Silurian, and moved back to central Africa during the Devonian.[7] However, more recent research, from Scotese & McKerrow, suggests that in Late Devonian, the South Pole was in north-central Argentina rather than Northern Africa, which was supported with paleoclimatic evidence.[6] The paleolatitude of Gondwana during the Middle to Late Devonian resided around intermediate latitudes of about 50S.[7]\\r\\nThe collision creating the Acadian orogeny resulted in the closing of the southern Iapetus ocean and the formation of a high mountain belt.[6] After the Acadian collision took place, Gondwana began to retreat from Laurentia with the newly accreted Avalonian terranes left behind. As Gondwana moved away, a new ocean opened up, the Rheic Ocean, during the Middle to Late Devonian, and subsequently its closure would result in the formation of the Alleghanian orogeny.[7]\\r\\nLaurentia is the North American paleocontinent, which also includes present day Northwest Ireland, Scotland, Greenland, the North Slope of Alaska, and the Chukotsk peninsula of NE Russia.[6] During the Ordovician-Devonian time, Laurentia remained at the same paleolatitude, slightly south of the equator in the southern hemisphere, with relatively the same paleolongitude.[7] Major defining tectonic events include the Neoproterozoic rift sequence from the breakup of Grenville basement rocks, thermal subsidence related to the Early Cambrian to Middle Ordovician drift sequence during the opening of the Iapetus ocean, the Appalachian accretionary events to the eastern continental margin, and the resulting foreland-basin and clastic wedges.[8]\\r\\nAvalonian terranes that constitute Avalonia are the modern day countries Northern France and Ardennes of Belgium, England, Wales, southeastern Ireland, eastern Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, southern New Brunswick and some coastal parts of New England. The basement consisted of Late Precambrian age arc rocks, and is believed to come from the margin of Gondwana, sometime in the Early Ordovician.[6] Avalonia rifted from Gondwana, during the onset of igneous activity in the Ardennes, Wales, and SE Ireland that consumed the Tornquist Sea oceanic crust. It drifted in a northerly direction and probably collided with Baltica in the Late Ordovician, and then with Laurentia in the Late Devonian. Evidence for this is consistent with paleomagnetic data which place Avalonia at a temperate latitude during the Ordovician and in a subtropical latitude during the Late Ordovician through the Devonian.[6]\\r\\nThe Acadian orogeny resulted from oblique convergence or major transcurrent movement along a large strike-slip fault which represents the zone of convergence between Lauruassia/Laurentia (North America) and Avalon terranes.[4] One or more of the Avalonian terranes accreted with the eastern margin of Laurentia, most likely beginning in the late Early Devonian.[9]\\r\\nThe evidence for the Acadian orogeny is abundant and widespread in the northern Appalachians, recorded by the plutonism and the migration of the northern Appalachian deformation front toward the craton. In the central to southern Appalachians, evidence for the Acadian orogeny is poor, and is found primarily in the plutonism of the Blue Ridge and metamorphism of the Cat Square terrane.[10]\\r\\nThe Acadian orogeny experienced at least three major phases of deformation, and in places, unconformities were recognized.[4] These phases were called tectophases, and represented the sequence of collisions that occurred from the Avalonian terranes accreting to Laurentia. As a result of these tectophases, deltas developed on the adjacent parts of the stable craton, eastern margin of Laurentia.[11] These deltas are described as foreland-basin, delta-complex clastic wedges, which are responsible for the large volumes of sediment input into the Appalachian basin.[9]\\r\\nAs mentioned previously, the Acadian Orogeny formed from the oblique convergence or major transcurrent movement along a large strike-slip fault moving in a southeasterly direction. Avalonian terranes accreted to the eastern margin of Laurentia during the Late to Middle Devonian.[4] This was a continent-continent collision with Baltica/Avalonia obliquely subducting below the eastern Laurentia margin, and closing the southern Iapetus ocean that resulted in a high mountain belt.[6]\\r\\nThe collision initiated a sequence of events where the older rocks on Laurentia and Avalonia were subjected deformation, plutonism, metamorphism, and uplift that occurred over a large area of eastern Laurentia (Naylor).[12] During the course of the orogeny, new faults formed, while older faults were reactivated.[2] Acadian deformation and metamorphism were asymmetric across the strike of the orogen. The Acadian plutons intruded every belt, unlike the deformation/metamorphism, where Avalonia escaped much of the damage suffered by the rocks in other localities (Bradley).[13] During the Middle Devonian, centers for volcanoes and uplift formed in the New England region and shed fine-grained clastic material into an inland seaway that covered a large part of southern and central Appalachia. Today, portions of the ancient Avalonia landmass occur in scattered outcrop belts along the eastern margin of North America. One belt occurs in Newfoundland, another forms the bedrock of much of the coastal region of New England from eastern Connecticut to northern Maine, where it is known as the Coastal Lithotectonic Block.[2]\\r\\nThe collision between Laurentia and Avalonian terranes is actually more complex than described above. The collision is broken into three, or possibly four tectophases, which represent a successive collision of the Avalonian terranes with eastern Laurentia.[4]\\r\\nBecause major clastic wedges and basinal deposits are distributed in a southwestward progression, it is assumed they originated from areas near promontories, areas along the continental margin where deformation is concentrated. As mention above, it was postulated that there are three, possibly four tectophases that represent increased convergence or possible collision between the continental margin promontories and Avalon terranes.[11] The earliest tectophase was located at the St. Lawrence Promontory in northern New England and in the Canadian Maritime Provinces.[9] The St. Lawrence tectophase was active during the Early to Middle Devonian with intense transpressional deformation which formed a basin in the Gasp Peninsula, northern New Brunswick, and northern New England.[11] Clastic wedges were present in this area, but the evidence for them has been mostly destroyed by succeeding tectonism.[9]\\r\\nThe second tectophase, during the Middle Devonian, represents the collision with the New York promontory. The southward migration of deformation reflected the third tectophase, which marks the collision of Avalon terranes with the Virginia promontory in the Middle to Late Devonian time. The effects of the New York and Virginia promontories together produced the Catskill Delta complex.[9]\\r\\nAs the migration of deformation continued southward along the fault zone, during the Early Mississippian time, the final collision occurred with the Alabama promontory .[11] Ettensohn later refers to the fourth tectophase as the Mississippian tectophase of the Acadian Orogeny, since it demonstrated an unusually long duration (Mississippian-Early Pennsylvanian).[9] Subsequently, the Pocono & equivalent clastic wedges essentially filled the epicontinental sea. The deposition of Middle Mississippian carbonates marks the end of the Acadian Orogeny and Catskill Delta complex.[11]\\r\\nForeland basins are a product of tectonic deformational loading, or crustal thickening along the orogen, a consequence of overthrusting and folding. The Acadian foreland basin is categorized as a retroarc foreland basin, which occurs on the overriding continental lithosphere, adjacent to a foreland fold-thrust belt behind a continental margin arc.[4] The initial result of loading is a bulge move out and uplift of the foreland, which generates a localized unconformity. The distributions of unconformities display an asymmetric pattern in relation to the promontories.[14] Subsidence follows bulge movement and uplift, and is produced on the cratonic side of the orogen due to regional isostatic adjustment to the load by the lithosphere.[4] Once thrust propagation declines, substantial relief and drainage nets have had time to develop, and the as a resulting coarser clastic sediment is eroded and transported to the foreland basin.[14]\\r\\nThe basement structures of the Appalachian foreland basin at the onset of the Acadian orogeny were reactivated during foreland lithospheric flexure. These structures affected the foreland basin evolution and sedimentation patterns, and the preexisting faults partitioned the basin into regions of fault-controlled uplift and depocenters.[15]\\r\\nThe Appalachian basin, during the Middle Devonian and Early Mississippian, is characterized by large volumes of deltaic sedimentary rocks that were deposited in the Acadian foreland basin as a response to the Acadian orogeny. These deposits extend from central New York and Pennsylvania westward to Ohio, and south along the Appalachian Mountains through Virginia and Tennessee to Alabama. The Acadian delta complex is categorized into two deltas, the Catskill Delta of Middle and Upper Devonian age, and the Price-Rockwell (Pocono) delta of Late Devonian and Early Mississippian age.[16] The Acadian delta complex is coupled to the four tectophases of the Acadian orogeny, both in terms of provenance and depositional settings. The relief resulting from the orogeny was the fundamental source of the delta sediments.[11]\\r\\nThe Catskill Delta complex consists of a coarsening upward sequence of rocks. Its thickness is greatest in eastern Pennsylvania and thins westward into Ohio. The Catskill paleogeography appears to consist of many small streams, which deposited their sedimentary load along a coastal alluvial plain that was hundreds of miles long.[16][16]\\r\\nThe Middle Devonian to Lower Mississippian siliciclastic strata, deposited by the Catskill Delta, includes black shale, gray shale, sandstone, red beds, and minor argillaceous limestone. The strata is deposited in a four-stage pattern that is observed in each tectophase. The formation of the foreland basin through rapid subsidence initiated a transgressive sequences that deposited basinal black shales. After the black shales are deposited, the migration of deformation continues southward, and regression dominates, particularly on the east side of the basin. As collision intensified, subsidence in the foreland basin declined, and sedimentation was replaced by an influx of calcareous silty shales and carbonates. These deposits reflect small transgressive-regressive cycles in a delta-front and delta platform environments. The third stage is represented by regional uplift, which accompanied the collision of an Avalon terrane with a promontory, and subsequently, developed a regional disconformity. The fourth and final stage is represented by tectonic quiescence with a widespread carbonate deposition in a slowly transgressing sea.[11]","input":"Which deltaic complex in north america originated as a result of the taconic (acadian) orogeny?"},{"output":"wet season","context":"The Philippines has five types of climates: tropical rainforest, tropical savanna, tropical monsoon, humid subtropical, and oceanic (both are in higher-altitude areas) characterized by relatively high temperature, oppressive humidity and plenty of rainfall.

The intensity and duration, however, are not uniform from year to year. Winter monsoons, by contrast, have a dominant easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge, subside and cause drought. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe summer monsoon brings heavy rains to most of the archipelago from May to October.

Once a tropical cyclone enters the PAR, regardless of strength, it is given a local name for identification purposes by the media, government, and the general public.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the past ten years, the Philippines has experienced a number of extremely damaging tropical cyclones, particularly typhoons with more than 20?km/h (12?mph; 11?kn; 5.6?m/s) of sustained winds. Because of this, the Super Typhoon (STY) category with more than 220?km/h (140?mph; 120?kn; 61?m/s) maximum sustained winds was officially adopted by the PAGASA. However, according to different stakeholders, the extensive and devastating damages caused by strong typhoons such as Typhoon Yolanda in 2013 made the four?level warning system inadequate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deadliest typhoon to impact the Philippines was Typhoon Haiyan, locally known as Yolanda, in November 2013, in which more than 6,300 lives were lost from its storm surges and powerful winds. Over 1,000 went missing and nearly 20,000 were injured.  Winds reached 315?km/h (196?mph; 170?kn; 88?m/s) in oneÿminute sustained and may have been the strongest storm in history in terms of wind speeds as wind speeds before the 1970s were too high to record.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in 1995, where Typhoon Angela, known as Rosing was an extremely catastrophic category 5 typhoon that made landfall in Catanduanes and made across Manila. Winds reached 290 km/h (180 mph) on one-minute sustain winds. Rosing took 936 lives and the most powerful typhoon that ever hit Metro Manila.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn late December 3, 2012, Typhoon Bopha or known as Pablo made landfall on Eastern Mindanao, damage was over 1.04 billion USD by winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) on one-minute sustain winds. Typhoon Bopha was the most powerful typhoon ever hit Mindanao, killing 1,067 people and 834 people were missing. Most of the damage was caused by rushing storm surges and screaming winds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of central pressure, Typhoon Megi (2010) measured 885 mb. This was the strongest storm ever to make landfall in terms of pressure. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was 295 kph (185 mph) in terms of one-minute sustained winds, killing 67 people and costing over 700 million USD in damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are four recognized climate types in the Philippines, and they are based on the distribution of rainfall (See the Philippine Climate Map at the top).[a]  They are described as follows:[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average year-round temperature measured from all the weather stations in the Philippines, except Baguio City, is 26.6?C (79.9?F). Cooler days are usually felt in the month of January with temperature averaging at 25.5?C (77.9?F) and the warmest days, in the month of May with a mean of 28.3?C (82.9?F).[1] Elevation factors significantly in the variation of temperature in the Philippines. In Baguio City, with an elevation of 1,500?m (4,900?ft) above sea level, the mean average is 18.3?C (64.9?F) or cooler by about 4.3?C (8?F).  In 1915, a one-year study was conducted by William H. Brown of the Philippine Journal of Science on top of Mount Banahaw at 2,100?m (6,900?ft) elevation.  The mean temperature measured was 18.6?C (65.5?F), a difference of 10?C (18?F) from the lowland mean temperature.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nRelative humidity is high in the Philippines.  A high amount of moisture or vapor in the air makes hot temperatures feel hotter.  This quantity of moisture is due to different factors ÿ the extraordinary evaporation from the seas that surrounds the country on all sides, to the different prevailing winds in the different seasons of the year, and finally, to the abundant rains so common in a tropical country. The first may be considered as general causes of the great humidity, which is generally observed in all the islands throughout the year.  The last two may influence the different degree of humidity for the different months of the year and for the different regions of the archipelago.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climate of the country is divided into two main seasons:","input":"What is the two seasons in the philippines?"},{"output":"Raja Harishchandra","context":"Raja Harishchandra is a 1913 Indian silent film, directed and produced by Dadasaheb Phalke, and is the first full-length Indian feature film.[1] The film was based on the legend of Raja Harishchandra, recounted in the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The silent film had intertitles in Marathi and its cast and staff were primarily Marathi people. Therefore, it is recognized as the first Marathi film along with the credit of being India's first full-length feature film.\\r\\nThe film marked a historic benchmark in the film industry in India. Only one print of the film was made. It was a commercial success and paved the way for more such films.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Harishchandra is giving his son a lesson in archery. A crowd approaches the king who, at the request of the citizens, goes out on a hunting expedition. He goes on a long adventure that involves walking alongside a river and climbing down a forested hill. Tragedy strikes Harishchandra when he unwittingly interrupts the sage Vishvamitra in the midst of his yajna. To assuage the sage, the contrite king offers his kingdom and lays down his crown. Back at the royal palace, the queen is swimming in an indoor pond with her handmaidens. She and the young prince are informed about the changed circumstances and the sage exiles all three royal personages to arrange for his gurudakshina. The trio leaves the palace amidst crying factotums and much frantic gesticulating. The royal couple eventually meets again? this time at a cremation ground where the prince lies dead. The duty-conscious Harishchandra, however, continues to rebuff his wife. The sage is then shown to frame the queen for murder. And a judge decrees that the queen be beheaded by the king. Harishchandra refuses to leave the straight and narrow path of virtue and upholds his promise even when pushed to this extreme. Pleased, an incarnation of Shiva manifests itself on screen. The sage is also revealed to be a benign examiner of Harishchandra's integrity. The king gets his crown back and the rejuvenated little prince once again dons his finery.[3]\\r\\nDattatraya Damodar Dabke, a Marathi stage actor played the lead role of Raja Harishchandra. The female lead role of Chandramathi, Harishchandra's wife was played by Anna Salunke, a male actor. Phalke's son Bhalchandra D. Phalke was the child artist who donned the role of Lohitashwa, son of Harishchandra.[2] Sage Vishwamitra's role was played by G.V. Sane. The story was an adaptation from the Hindu mythology and was scripted by DadaSaheb Phalke. Other artists in the film were:\\r\\nDhundiraj Govind Phalke, popularly addressed in reverence, as Dada Saheb Phalke, who eventually came to don the title \\"father of Indian Cinema\\",[4] was the director, script writer and producer of the film. He started a studio in Dadar Main Road. He wrote the screen play, and created the sets for the film and started shooting the film himself. The film was Dadas first feature film venture of full film length of 3700?ft (in four reels) about 50 minutes of running time, and it took seven months 21 days to complete the film.[5][6] The film was screened at the Coronation Cinema in 1913 before invited audience of the representatives of the press and guests. The film received wide acclaim and was a commercial success. Phalke followed it up by making films such as Satyavan Savitri, Satyawadi Raja Harish Chandra(1917), Lanka Dahan(1917), Sri Krisna Janma(1918) and Kaliya Mardan(1919).[4]\\r\\nPhalke was greatly influenced by the style of painter Raja Ravi Verma in the making of his films. Just as Verma brought Hindu mythology on canvas, Phalke brought it in motion pictures.[7] He would make many films based on mythological stories from Ramayana, Mahabharata and others.\\r\\nThe film had an all-male cast as no woman was available for playing female leads.[8] Phalke struggled to get woman, including nautch girls, to agree to act in film. He hence had to cast a delicate-looking man to play the role of Queen Taramati, Harishchandra's wife. Phalke discovered Salunke, who used to work in a restaurant as a cook, for this role. Salunke would later play the role of both Rama and Sita in Phalke's 1917 film Lanka Dahan and become the most popular actor and actress of his time.[9] Dadasaheb's wife cooked food alone, without any help, for the whole cast and crew, which were more than 500 people. She also washed the clothes and costumes, helped in the posters and production of the film, and co-operated with the cast, satisfying them with food and water.[5]\\r\\nHarishchandrachi Factory is a 2009 film based on the making of Raja Harischandra. The title is based on the fact that, when the film was made, working in films was taboo, so Dada Saheb advised his artists to tell others that they were working in the factory of one 'Harishchandra'.[10]\\r\\nSome have argued that Raja Harischandra cannot be called the first Indian film as Dadasaheb Torne's film Shree Pundalik was released on 18 May 1912 in Bombay, one year before Phalke's film. However, Shree Pundalik is a cinematographic recording of a play, using a single, fixed camera; it is one of a number of such Indian films that predated Raja Harishchandra. Additionally, the cameraman for Shree Pundalik was a Briton, and the film stock was processed in London.[11][12]\\r\\nThe film premiered on 21 April 1913 at the Olympia Theatre, Grant Road for a selective audience that included famous personalities of Bombay (Mumbai) and editors of many newspapers.[13] It was first shown in public on 3 May 1913[14][15] at Bombay's Coronation Cinema, Girgaon, where crowds thronged the roads outside the hall, as it marked the beginning of the Indian film industry. The film was so successful that Dada Saheb had to make more prints to show the film in rural areas as well.[citation needed] The film was a grand success and soon established Phalke as a producer and paved the way for the Indian film industry.\\r\\nThe original film was in four reels, and the National Film Archive of India, Pune has only the first and last reels, making the film a partially lost film.

It sits about 16 kilometres (9.9?mi) west of Antigua, one of Guatemala's most famous cities and a tourist destination.[2] It has erupted frequently since the Spanish conquest, most recently in June 2018.[3][4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFuego is famous for being almost constantly active at a low level. Small gas and ash eruptions occur every 15 to 20 minutes, but larger eruptions are rare. Andesite and basalt lava types dominate, and recent eruptions have tended to be more mafic than older ones.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe volcano is joined with Acatenango and collectively the complex is known as La Horqueta.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1881, French writer Eugenio Dussaussay climbed the volcano, then practically unexplored.[7] First, he needed to ask for permission to climb from the Sacatepquez governor, who gave him a letter for the Alotenango mayor asking for his assistance with guides to help the explorer and his companion, Tadeo Trabanino.[8]  They wanted to climb the central peak, unexplored at the time, but could not find a guide and had to climb to the active cone, which had a recent eruption in 1880.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish archeologist Alfred Percival Maudslay climbed the volcano on 7 January 1892.  Here is how he described his expedition:[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n [...] we arranged to start the very next day for the village of Alotenango. On the 7th January we left that village about 7 o'clock in the morning with seven Mozos, carrying food, clothing, and my camp-bed, and rode for an hour towards the mountains, when we dismounted and sent back our mules. The first two hours' climb was not so very steep, but it was tiring work walking over the loose mould and dry leaves under the thick forest. [...] we recommenced our climb under shadow of the forest by a steep path cut through the undergrowth. At the height of about 9500 feet we, for the first time since starting, got a sight of the peak rising on the other side of a deep ravine. The whole of the slope on which we looked was bare of vegetation, and presented to the eye nothing but desolate slopes of ashes and scoriae broken higher up with patches of burnt rock; we scrambled on through the thick undergrowth, often with loose earth under foot, and by degrees the vegetation changed and we got amongst the pine-trees. At about 11,200 feet we came to a spot where the earth had been levelled for a few yards by the Indians, and there we determined to pass the night. [...] then returned and watched the reflection of the sunset over the more distant peaks and against the perfect cone of Agua. [...] but the cold which followed the sunset soon took all our attention. [...] We turned out of our shelter at about half-past four in the morning, and felt all the better after drinking hot coffee?; we then sat for an hour watching a most beautiful dawn and sunrise. At the opposite side of the valley rose the Volcano of Agua, sloping on one side to the plain of Antigua, and on the other in a long unbroken sweep to the sea, more than forty miles away. Peak after peak stood out against the red light into the far distance, and on the right the low coast-line and the sea showed up very clearly. As soon as the sun was up we started for the summit. I stopped on the way to get a photograph of the cone, which lay to the left of us as we ascended?; but the clouds came over just as I was ready, and I had to give it up. A little over 12,000 feet we left the scraggy pine-trees and arrived at the northern end of a cinder ridge, called the Meseta, which is at the summit of the slope we had been climbing. \\r\\nThe strongest earthquakes experienced by the city of Santiago de los Caballeros before its final move in 1776 were the San Miguel earthquakes in 1717. In the city, people also believed that the proximity of the Volcn de Fuego (English: Volcano of Fire) was the cause of earthquakes; the great architect Diego de Porres even said that all the earthquakes were caused by volcano explosions.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 27 August there was a strong eruption of Volcn de Fuego, which lasted until 30 August; the residents of the city asked for help to Santo Cristo of the Cathedral and to the Virgen del Socorro who were sworn patrons of the Volcan de Fuego. On 29 August a Virgen del Rosario procession took to the streets after a century without leaving her temple, and there were many more holy processions until 29 September, the day of San Miguel. Early afternoon earthquakes were minor, but at about 7:00?pm there was a strong earthquake that forced residents to leave their homes; tremors and rumblings followed until four o'clock. The neighbors took to the streets and loudly confessed their sins, bracing for the worst.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe San Miguel earthquake damaged the city considerably, to the point that some rooms and walls of the Royal Palace were destroyed. There was also a partial abandonment of the city, food shortages, lack of manpower and extensive damage to the city infrastructure; not to mention numerous dead and injured.[14] These earthquakes made the authorities consider moving to a new city less prone to seismic activity. City residents strongly opposed the move, and even took to the Royal Palace in protest; in the end, the city did not move, but the number of elements in the Army Battalion to safeguard the order was considerable.[15] The damage to the palace was repaired by Diego de Porres, who finished repairs in 1720; although there are indications that there were more jobs done by Porres until 1736.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1773, the Santa Marta earthquakes destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location for the city.[16] The Spanish Crown ordered, in 1776, the removal of the capital to a safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where Guatemala City, the modern capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci܇n (New Guatemala of the Assumption), and its patron saint is Our Lady of the Assumption. The badly damaged city of Santiago de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 2002, the Volcn de Fuego entered a new active period, with more or less continuous activity, interspersed with monthly eruptive episodes. These episodes would typically send ash falling on communities within 20km of the volcano, and lava flows about 1-2km from the summit, and the occasional pyroclastic density current.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 June 2018, the volcano suddenly produced its most powerful eruption since 1974. Large pyroclastic density currents were produced that over-topped the barranca boundaries they had previously been confined to and unexpectedly hit El Rodeo, Las Lajas, San Miguel Los Lotes, and La Reuni܇n villages in Escuintla, which buried the towns and killed many of the surprised residents. Later, 18 bodies were found in the village of San Miguel Los Lotes. \\r\\nMembers of the Shriners International fraternity[25] met six of over fifty burned children, ages 1-16[26], that were sent from Guatemala to the Shriners Hospital in Galveston, Texas[27] and accompanied by 5 guardians[25] for receiving the appropriate and medical treatment[26].\\r\\n\\r\\nAsh fall extended as far as the capital, Guatemala City forcing the closure of La Aurora International Airport. \\r\\nThe military assisted in clearing ash off of the runway.

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as cell biology. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. However, many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from spontaneous generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three tenets to the cell theory are as described below:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of these tenets is disputed, as non-cellular entities such as viruses are sometimes considered life-forms.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discovery of the cell was made possible through the invention of the microscope. In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass, discovering that objects appeared to be larger under the glass. In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino DArmate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in eyeglasses in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of simple microscopes (magnifying glasses) with limited magnification.[3] Compound microscope, which combine an objective lens with an eyepiece to view a real image achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620[4][5] In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book Micrographia. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nExtensive microscopic study was done by Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses.  This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His were a single lens simple microscope, rather than a compound microscope. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress for the microscopes until the 1850s, two hundred years later. Carl Zeiss, a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired Otto Schott and eventually Ernst Abbe.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOptical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a wavelength or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. Later in the 1920s, the electron microscope was developed, making it possible to view objects that are smaller than optical wavelengths, once again, changing the possibilities in science.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cell was first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, which can be found to be described in his book Micrographia. In this book, he gave 60 observations in detail of various objects under a coarse, compound microscope.[6] One observation was from very thin slices of bottle cork. Hooke discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named \\"cells\\". This came from the Latin word Cella, meaning a small room like monks lived in and also Cellulae, which meant the six sided cell of a honeycomb. However, Hooke did not know their real structure or function.[8] \\r\\nWhat Hooke had thought were cells, were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues. With microscopes during this time having a low magnification, Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing. Therefore, he did not think the \\"cellulae\\" were alive.[9] His cell observations gave no indication of the nucleus and other organelles found in most living cells. In Micrographia, Hooke also observed mould, bluish in color, found on leather. After studying it under his microscope, he was unable to observe seeds that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity. This led to Hooke suggesting that spontaneous generation, from either natural or artificial heat, was the cause. Since this was an old Aristotelian theory still accepted at the time, others did not reject it and was not disproved until Leeuwenhoek later discovers generation is achieved otherwise.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnton van Leeuwenhoek is another scientist who saw these cells soon after Hooke did. He made use of a microscope containing improved lenses that could magnify objects almost 300-fold, or 270x.[9] Under these microscopes, Leeuwenhoek found motile objects. In a letter to The Royal Society on October 9, 1676, he states that motility is a quality of life therefore these were living organisms. Over time, he wrote many more papers in which described many specific forms of microorganisms. Leeuwenhoek named these animalcules, which included protozoa and other unicellular organisms, like bacteria.[7] Though he did not have much formal education, he was able to identify the first accurate description of red blood cells and discovered bacteria after gaining interest in the sense of taste that resulted in Leeuwenhoek to observe the tongue of an ox, then leading him to study \\"pepper water\\" in 1676. He also found for the first time the sperm cells of animals and humans. Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the egg cell. This put an end to the previous theory of spontaneous generation. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cells in animal tissues were observed after plants were because the tissues were so fragile and susceptible to tearing, it was difficult for such thin slices to be prepared for studying. Biologists believed that there was a fundamental unit to life, but were unsure what this was. It would not be until over a hundred years later that this fundamental unit was connected to cellular structure and existence of cells in animals or plants.[10]  This conclusion was not made until Henri Dutrochet. Besides stating the cell is the fundamental element of organization,[11] Dutrochet also claimed that cells were not just a structural unit, but also a physiological unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1804, Karl Rudolphi and J.H.F. Link were awarded the prize for \\"solving the problem of the nature of cells\\", meaning they were the first to prove that cells had independent cell walls by the K?nigliche Societ?t der Wissenschaft (Royal Society of Science), G?ttingen.[12] Before, it had been thought that cells shared walls and the fluid passed between them this way.\\r\\n\\r\\nCredit for developing cell theory is usually given to two scientists: Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden.[13] While Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory, he is not as credited for his attributions toward it. In 1839, Schleiden suggested that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or the result of cells. He also suggested that cells were made by a crystallization process either within other cells or from the outside.[14] However, this was not an original idea of Schleiden. He claimed this theory as his own, though Barthelemy Dumortier had stated it years before him. This crystallization process is no longer accepted with modern cell theory. In 1839, Theodor Schwann states that along with plants, animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures.[15] This was a major advancement in the field of biology since little was known about animal structure up to this point compared to plants. From these conclusions about plants and animals, two of the three tenets of cell theory were postulated.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells\\r\\n\\r\\n2. The cell is the most basic unit of life\\r\\n\\r\\nSchleiden's theory of free cell formation through crystallization was refuted in the 1850s by Robert Remak, Rudolf Virchow, and Albert Kolliker.[7] In 1855, Rudolf Virchow added the third tenet to cell theory. In Latin, this tenet states Omnis cellula e cellula.[10]  This translated to:\\r\\n\\r\\n3. All cells arise only from pre-existing cells\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the idea that all cells come from pre-existing cells had in fact already been proposed by Robert Remak; it has been suggested that Virchow plagiarized Remak and did not give him credit.[16] Remak published observations in 1852 on cell division, claiming Schleiden and Schawnn were incorrect about generation schemes. He instead said that binary fission, which was first introduced by Dumortier, was how reproduction of new animal cells were made. Once this tenet was added, the classical cell theory was complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe generally accepted parts of modern cell theory include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern version of the cell theory includes the ideas that:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cell was  first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 using a microscope. The first cell theory is credited to the work of Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called protoplasm and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, colloidal chemistry began its development, and the concepts of bound water emerged. A colloid being something between a solution and a suspension, where Brownian motion is sufficient to prevent sedimentation.\\r\\nThe idea of a semipermeable membrane, a barrier that is permeable to solvent but impermeable to solute molecules was developed at about the same time. The term osmosis originated in 1827 and its importance to physiological phenomena realized, but it wasnt until 1877, when the botanist Pfeffer proposed the membrane theory of cell physiology. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the plasma membrane, and cell water and solutes such as a potassium ion existed in a physical state like that of a dilute solution. In 1889 Hamburger used hemolysis of erythrocytes to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on osmosis, permeability, and electrical properties of cells.[21] The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the protoplasm was responsible for these properties.\\r\\nThe membrane theory developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of Charles Darwin) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the lipid membrane was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to anions, Leonor Michaelis concluded that ions are adsorbed to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by electrostatic repulsion. Michaelis demonstrated the membrane potential (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.[22] Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a lipid bilayer membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle & Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both K+ and Cl?, but apparently not to Na+, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to K+, H+, and Cl? as well as the impermeability to Na+, Ca+, and Mg2+.\\r\\nOver the same time period, it was shown (Procter & Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions. Loeb (1920) also studied gelatin extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in gels without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the H+ concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties. Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined formthe protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and waterand demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and fibrin gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.\\r\\nBy the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks & Brooks published a monograph, \\"The Permeability of Living Cells\\", which rejects the bulk phase theories.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the development of radioactive tracers, it was shown that cells are not impermeable to Na+. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove Na+ as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of dynamic equilibrium, constantly using energy to maintain ion gradients. In 1935, Karl Lohmann discovered ATP and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven sodium pump was proposed.\\r\\nThe tremendous success of Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided even more support for the membrane pump hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane.\\r\\nThese major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as factthere are, however, a few dissenters.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, The Problems of Cell Permeability, in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English) in which he found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1962, Gilbert Ling became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.\\r\\n\\r\\nCells can be subdivided into the following subcategories:\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a multicellular body (100ÿ150 different cell types), compared\\r\\nwith 10ÿ20 in plants, fungi, and protoctista.[25]","input":"Who were the scientists who developed the cell theory?"},{"output":"decreased blood pressure","context":"1ANP, 1YK0, 3N57\\r\\n4878\\r\\n230899\\r\\nENSG00000175206\\r\\nENSMUSG00000041616\\r\\nP01160\\r\\nP05125\\r\\nNM_006172\\r\\nNM_008725\\r\\nNP_006163\\r\\nNP_032751\\r\\nAtrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a peptide hormone which reduces an expanded extracellular fluid (ECF) volume by increasing renal sodium excretion. ANP is synthesized, and secreted by cardiac muscle cells in the walls of the atria in the heart. These cells contain volume receptors which respond to increased stretching of the atrial wall due to increased atrial blood volume. ANP is one of a family of nine natriuretic peptides: seven are atrial in origin.\\r\\nANP acts on the kidney to increase sodium and water excretion (natriuresis) in the following ways: 1) it dilates the glomerular afferent and constricts efferent arterioles, and relaxes the mesangial cells. This increases pressure in the glomerular capillaries, increasing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), resulting in an increased amount of sodium and water being filtered and excreted. 2) It increases blood flow through the vasa recta, which washes the solutes sodium chloride (NaCl) and urea out of the medullary interstitium ÿ the lower osmolarity here leads to less reabsorption of tubular fluid and increased excretion. 3) It decreases sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and cortical collecting duct. 4) It inhibits renin secretion, thereby inhibiting the production of angiotensin and aldosterone. 5) It inhibits the renal sympathetic nervous system. ANP has the opposite effect of aldosterone on the kidney: aldosterone increases renal sodium retention and ANP increases renal sodium loss.[5][6]\\r\\nReduction of blood volume by ANP can result in secondary effects such as reduction of extracellular fluid (ECF) volume (edema), improved cardiac ejection fraction with resultant improved organ perfusion, decreased blood pressure, and increased serum potassium. These effects may be blunted or negated by various counter-regulatory mechanisms operating concurrently on each of these secondary effects.\\r\\nBrain natriuretic peptide (BNP) ÿ a misnomer; it is secreted by cardiac muscle cells in the heart ventricles ÿ is similar to ANP in its effect. It acts via the same receptors as ANP does, but with 10-fold lower affinity than ANP. The biological half-life of BNP, however, is twice as long as that of ANP, and that of NT-proBNP is even longer, making these peptides better choices than ANP for diagnostic blood testing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discovery of ANP was reported in 1981, when rat atrial extracts were found to contain a substance that increased salt and urine output in the kidney.[7] Later, the substance was purified from heart tissue by several groups and named atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) or ANP.[8]\\r\\nANP is a 28-amino acid peptide with a 17-amino acid ring in the middle of the molecule. The ring is formed by a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues at positions 7 and 23. ANP is closely related to BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) and CNP (C-type natriuretic peptide), which all share a similar amino acid ring structure. ANP is one of a family of nine structurally similar natriuretic hormones: seven are atrial in origen.[9]\\r\\nHuman ANP is encoded by the NPPA gene on the short arm of chromosome 1, which has 3 exons and 2 introns. The gene is expressed primarily in atrial myocytes. Lower levels of NPPA expression are found in other tissues such as the brain, kidney, lung, uterus and placenta.\\r\\nIn atrial myocytes, ANP is made as a precursor form, i.e. prepro-ANP, a polypeptide of 151 amino acids. After the signal peptide is removed in the endoplasmic reticulum, the 126-amino-acid pro-ANP is stored in the intracellular granules. When the cells are stimulated, pro-ANP is released and converted to the 28-amino-acid C-terminal mature ANP on the cell surface by the cardiac transmembrane serine protease corin.[10][11]\\r\\nANP is secreted in response to:\\r\\nThree types of atrial natriuretic peptide receptors have been identified on which natriuretic peptides act. They are all cell surface receptors and designated:\\r\\nNPR-A and NPR-B have a single membrane-spanning segment with an extracellular domain that binds the ligand. The intracellular domain maintains two consensus catalytic domains for guanylyl cyclase activity. Binding of a natriuretic peptide induces a conformational change in the receptor that causes receptor dimerization and activation.\\r\\nThe binding of ANP to its receptor causes the conversion of GTP to cGMP and raises intracellular cGMP. As a consequence, cGMP activates a cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG or cGK) that phosphorylates proteins at specific serine and threonine residues. In the medullary collecting duct, the cGMP generated in response to ANP may act not only through PKG but also via direct modulation of ion channels.[13]\\r\\nNPR-C functions mainly as a clearance receptor by binding and sequestering ANP from the circulation. All natriuretic peptides are bound by the NPR-C.\\r\\nMaintenance of the ECF volume (space), and its subcompartment the vascular space, is crucial for survival. These compartments are maintained within a narrow range, despite wide variations in dietary sodium intake. There are three volume regulating systems: two salt saving systems, the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) and the renal sympathetic system (RSS); and the salt excreting natriuretic peptide (NP) hormone system. When the vascular space contracts, the RAAS and RSS are \\"turned on\\"?; when the atria expand, NP's are \\"turned on\\". Each system also suppresses its counteracting system(s). NP's are made in cardiac, intestinal, renal, and adrenal tissue: ANP in one of a family of cardiac NP's: others at BNP, CNP, and DNP.[14]\\r\\nANP binds to a specific set of receptors ÿ ANP receptors. Receptor-agonist binding causes the increase in renal sodium excretion, which results in a decreased ECF and blood volume. Secondary effects may be an improvement in cardiac ejection fraction and reduction of systemic blood pressure.\\r\\nRelaxes vascular smooth muscle in arterioles and venules by:\\r\\nPromotes uterine spiral artery remodeling, which is important for preventing pregnancy-induced hypertension.[18]\\r\\nModulation of the effects of ANP is achieved through gradual degradation of the peptide by the enzyme neutral endopeptidase (NEP). Recently, NEP inhibitors have been developed; however they have not yet been licensed. They may be clinically useful in treating congestive heart disease.\\r\\nFragments derived from the ANP precursor, including the signal peptide, N-terminal pro-ANP and ANP, have been detected in human blood.[19] ANP and related peptides are used as biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction and heart failure.[20][21][22][23]\\r\\nLarge amounts of ANP secretion has been noted to cause electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia) and polyuria. These indications can be a marker of a large atrial myxoma.[24]\\r\\nRecombinant human ANP has been approved in Japan to treat patients with heart failure.[25]\\r\\nAs of 2017 a truncated form of ANP called ularitide was under development in Phase III trials for heart failure.[26]\\r\\nBrain natriuretic peptide (BNP) ÿ a misnomer; it is secreted by ventricular myocytes ÿ is similar to ANP in its effect. It acts via atrial natriuretic peptide receptors but with 10-fold lower affinity than ANP. The biological half-life of BNP, however, is twice as long as that of ANP, and that of NT-proBNP is even longer, making these peptides better choices than ANP for diagnostic blood testing.\\r\\nIn addition to the mammalian natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, CNP), other natriuretic peptides with similar structure and properties have been isolated elsewhere in the animal kingdom. A salmon natriuretic peptide known as salmon cardiac peptide has been described,[27] and dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP) has been found in the venom of the green mamba, as well as an NP in a species of African snake.[28]\\r\\nBeside these four, five additional natriuretic peptides have been identified: long-acting natriuretic peptide (LANP), vessel dilator, kaliuretic peptide, urodilatin, and adrenomedullin.[29]\\r\\nNeutral endopeptidase (NEP) also known as neprilysin is the enzyme that metabolizes natriuretic peptides. Several inhibitors of NEP are currently being developed to treat disorders ranging from hypertension to heart failure. Most of them are dual inhibitors (NEP and ACE). In 2014, PARADIGM-HF study was published in NEJM. This study considered as a landmark study in treatment of heart failure. The study was double blinded; compared LCZ696 versus enalapril in patients with heart failure. The study showed lower all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization in LCZ696 arm.[30] Omapatrilat (dual inhibitor of NEP and angiotensin-converting enzyme) developed by BMS did not receive FDA approval due to angioedema safety concerns. Other dual inhibitors of NEP with ACE/angiotensin receptor are (in 2003) being developed by pharmaceutical companies.[31]\\r\\nANP is also called atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH), cardionatrine, cardiodilatin (CDD), and atriopeptin.\\r\\nBody water: Intracellular fluid/Cytosol","input":"What effect does anp have on blood pressure?"},{"output":"Punjab","context":"Rashtriya Raksha Dal (National Defence Party), a political party in India, mainly based in Punjab.

It is the second most important blood group system, after the ABO blood group system. The Rh blood group system consists of 49 defined blood group antigens[1], among which the five antigens D, C, c, E, and e are the most important. There is no d (\\"little d\\") antigen. Rh(D) status of an individual is normally described with a positive or negative suffix after the ABO type. e.g. Someone who is A Positive has the A antigen and the Rh(D) antigen, whereas someone who is A Negative lacks the Rh(D) antigen. The terms Rh factor, Rh positive and Rh negative refer to the Rh(D) antigen only. Antibodies to Rh antigens can be involved in hemolytic transfusion reactions and antibodies to the Rh(D) and Rh(c) antigens confer significant risk of Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Rh\\" was originally an abbreviation of \\"Rhesus factor.\\"  It was discovered in 1937 by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander S. Wiener who, at the time, believed it to be a similar antigen found in rhesus monkey red blood cells.  It was subsequently learned the human factor is not identical to the rhesus monkey factor; but by then, \\"Rhesus Group\\" and like terms were already in widespread, worldwide use.  Thus, notwithstanding it is a misnomer, the term survives (e.g. rhesus blood group system, and the obsolete terms rhesus factor,  rhesus positive, and rhesus negative - all three which actually refer specifically and only to the Rh D factor; and, thus, are misleading when unmodified). Contemporary practice is to use \\"Rh\\" as a term of art instead of \\"Rhesus\\"; viz. \\"Rh Group,\\" \\"Rh factors,\\" \\"Rh D,\\" etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first rhesus blood type was discovered in 1937 by Landsteiner and Wiener, who named it after a similar factor found in rhesus monkey blood.  The significance of the discovery was not immediately apparent and was only realized in 1940, after subsequent findings by Philip Levine and Rufus Stetson.[2]  The serum that led to the discovery was produced by immunizing rabbits with red blood cells from a rhesus macaque. The antigen that induced this immunization was designated by them as Rh factor to indicate that rhesus blood had been used for the production of the serum.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1939, Phillip Levine and Rufus Stetson published in a first case report the clinical consequences of non-recognized Rh factor, hemolytic transfusion reaction, and hemolytic disease of the newborn in its most severe form.[4] It was recognized that the serum of the reported woman agglutinated with red blood cells of about 80% of the people although the then known blood groups, in particular ABO were matched. No name was given to this agglutinin when described. In 1940, Karl Landsteiner and Alexander S. Wiener made the connection to their earlier discovery, reporting a serum that also reacted with about 85% of different human red blood cells.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1941, Group O: a patient of Dr. Paul in Irvington, NJ, delivered a normal infant in 1931:[6] this pregnancy was followed by a long period of sterility. The second pregnancy (April, 1941) resulted in an infant suffering icterus gravis.[7] In May 1941, the third anti-Rh serum (M.S.) of Group O became available.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the serologic similarities,  Rh factor was later also used for antigens, and anti-Rh for antibodies, found in humans such as those previously described by Levine and Stetson. Although differences between these two sera were shown already in 1942 and clearly demonstrated in 1963, the already widely used term \\"Rh\\" was kept for the clinically described human antibodies which are different from the ones related to the rhesus monkey. This real factor found in rhesus macaque was classified in the Landsteiner-Wiener antigen system (antigen LW, antibody anti-LW) in honor of the discoverers.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was recognized that the Rh factor was just one in a system of various antigens. Based on different models of genetic inheritance, two different terminologies were developed; both of them are still in use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clinical significance of this highly immunizing D antigen (i.e., Rh factor) was soon realized. Some keystones were to recognize its importance for blood transfusion (including reliable diagnostic tests), hemolytic disease of the newborn (including exchange transfusion), and very importantly the prevention of it by screening and prophylaxis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discovery of fetal cell-free DNA in maternal circulation by Holzgrieve et al. led to the noninvasive genotyping of fetal Rh genes in many countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rh blood group system has two sets of nomenclatures: one developed by Ronald Fisher and R.R. Race, the other by Wiener. Both systems reflected alternative theories of inheritance. The Fisher-Race system, which is more commonly in use today, uses the CDE nomenclature. This system was based on the theory that a separate gene controls the product of each corresponding antigen (e.g., a \\"D gene\\" produces D antigen, and so on). However, the d gene was hypothetical, not actual.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wiener system used the RhÿHr nomenclature. This system was based on the theory that there was one gene at a single locus on each chromosome, each contributing to production of multiple antigens. In this theory, a gene R1 is supposed to give rise to the blood factors Rh0, rh, and rh (corresponding to modern nomenclature of the D, C, and E antigens) and the gene r to produce hr and hr (corresponding to modern nomenclature of the c and e antigens).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotations of the two theories are used interchangeably in blood banking (e.g., Rho(D) meaning RhD positive). Wieners notation is more complex and cumbersome for routine use. Because it is simpler to explain, the Fisher-Race theory has become more widely used.\\r\\n\\r\\nDNA testing has shown that both are partially correct.[citation needed] There are in fact two linked genes, the RHD gene which produces a single immune specificity (anti-D) and the RHCE gene with multiple specificities (anti-C, anti-c, anti-E, anti-e). Thus, Wieners postulate that a gene could have multiple specificities (something many did not give credence to originally) has been proven correct. On the other hand, Wieners theory that there is only one gene has proven incorrect, as has the Fischer-Race theory that there are three genes, rather than the 2. The CDE notation used in the Fisher-Race nomenclature is sometimes rearranged to DCE to more accurately represent the co-location of the C and E encoding on the RhCE gene, and to make interpretation easier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proteins which carry the Rh antigens are transmembrane proteins, whose structure suggest that they are ion channels.[12] The main antigens are D, C, E, c and e, which are encoded by two adjacent gene loci, the RHD gene which encodes the RhD protein with the D antigen (and variants)[13] and the RHCE gene which encodes the RhCE protein with the C, E, c and e antigens (and variants).[14] There is no d antigen. Lowercase \\"d\\" indicates the absence of the D antigen (the gene is usually deleted or otherwise nonfunctional).\\r\\n\\r\\nRh phenotypes are readily identified through the presence or absence of the Rh surface antigens. As can be seen in the table below, most of the Rh phenotypes can be produced by several different Rh genotypes. The exact genotype of any individual can only be identified by DNA analysis. Regarding patient treatment, only the phenotype is usually of any clinical significance to ensure a patient is not exposed to an antigen they are likely to develop antibodies against. A probable genotype may be speculated on, based on the statistical distributions of genotypes in the patients place of origin.\\r\\n\\r\\nR0 (cDe or Dce) is today most common in Africa. The allele was thus often assumed in early blood group analyses to have been typical of populations on the continent; particularly in areas below the Sahara. Given the presence of high R0 percentages among Sephardim and Ashkenazim Jews compared to native European populations and the relative genetic isolation of Ashkenazim, Ottensooser et al. (1963) therefore suggested that high R0 frequencies were likely characteristic of the ancient Judea Jews, who had emigrated from Egypt prior to their dispersal throughout the Mediterranean Basin and Europe.[15] However, more recent studies have found R0 frequencies as low as 24.3% among some Afroasiatic-speaking groups in the Horn of Africa,[16] as well as higher R0 frequencies among certain other Afroasiatic speakers in North Africa (37.3%)[17] and among some Palestinians in the Levant (30.4%).[18]\\r\\n\\r\\n? Figures taken from a study performed in 1948 on a sample of 2000 people in the United Kingdom.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hemolytic condition occurs when there is an incompatibility between the blood types of the mother and the fetus. There is also potential incompatibility if the mother is Rh negative and the father is positive. When any incompatibility is detected, the mother often receives an injection at 28 weeks gestation and at birth to avoid the development of antibodies toward the fetus. These terms do not indicate which specific antigen-antibody incompatibility is implicated. The disorder in the fetus due to Rh D incompatibility is known as erythroblastosis fetalis.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the condition is caused by the Rh D antigen-antibody incompatibility, it is called Rh D Hemolytic disease of the newborn or Rh disease. Here, sensitization to Rh D antigens (usually by feto-maternal transfusion during pregnancy) may lead to the production of maternal IgG anti-D antibodies which can pass through the placenta. This is of particular importance to D negative females at or below childbearing age, because any subsequent pregnancy may be affected by the Rh D hemolytic disease of the newborn if the baby is D positive. The vast majority of Rh disease is preventable in modern antenatal care by injections of IgG anti-D antibodies (Rho(D) Immune Globulin). The incidence of Rh disease is mathematically related to the frequency of D negative individuals in a population, so Rh disease is rare in old-stock populations of Africa and the eastern half of Asia, and the Indigenous peoples of Oceania and the Americas, but more common in other genetic groups, most especially Western Europeans, but also other West Eurasians, and to a lesser degree, native Siberians, as well as those of mixed-race with a significant or dominant descent from those (e.g. the vast majority of Latin Americans and Central Asians).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frequency of Rh factor blood types and the RhD neg allele gene differs in various populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf both of a childs parents are Rh negative, the child will definitely be Rh negative. Otherwise the child may be Rh positive or Rh negative, depending on the parents' specific genotypes.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe D antigen is inherited as one gene (RHD) (on the short arm of the first chromosome, p36.13ÿp34.3) with various alleles. Though very much simplified, one can think of alleles that are positive or negative for the D antigen. The gene codes for the RhD protein on the red cell membrane. D? individuals who lack a functional RHD gene do not produce the D antigen, and may be immunized by D+ blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe epitopes for the next 4 most common Rh antigens, C, c, E and e are expressed on the highly similar RhCE protein that is genetically encoded in the RHCE gene, also found on chromosome 1. It has been shown that the RHD gene arose by duplication of the RHCE gene during primate evolution.[citation needed] Mice have just one RH gene.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe RHAG gene, which is responsible for encoding Rh-associated glycoprotein (RhAG), is found on chromosome 6a.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe polypeptides produced from the RHD and RHCE genes form a complex on the red blood cell membrane with the Rh-associated glycoprotein.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the basis of structural homology it has been proposed that the product of RHD gene, the RhD protein, is a membrane transport protein of uncertain specificity (CO2 or NH3) and unknown physiological role.[32][33] The three-dimensional structure of the related RHCG protein and biochemical analysis of the RhD protein complex indicates that the RhD protein is one of three subunits of an ammonia transporter.[34][35] Three recent studies[36][37][38] have reported a protective effect of the RhD-positive phenotype, especially RhD heterozygosity, against the negative effect of latent toxoplasmosis on psychomotor performance in infected subjects. RhD-negative compared to RhD-positive subjects without anamnestic titres of anti-Toxoplasma antibodies have shorter reaction times in tests of simple reaction times. And conversely, RhD-negative subjects with anamnestic titres (i.e. with latent toxoplasmosis) exhibited much longer reaction times than their RhD-positive counterparts. The published data suggested that only the protection of RhD-positive heterozygotes was long term in nature; the protection of RhD-positive homozygotes decreased with duration of the infection while the performance of RhD-negative homozygotes decreased immediately after the infection. The overall change in reaction times was always larger in the RhD-negative group than in the RhD-positive.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time, the origin of RHD polymorphism was an evolutionary enigma.[39][40][41] Before the advent of modern medicine, the carriers of the rarer allele (e.g. RhD-negative women in a population of RhD positives or RhD-positive men in a population of RhD negatives) were at a disadvantage as some of their children (RhD-positive children born to preimmunised RhD-negative mothers) were at a higher risk of fetal or newborn death or health impairment from hemolytic disease. It was suggested that higher tolerance of RhD-positive heterozygotes against Toxoplasma-induced impairment of reaction time [36][37] and Toxoplasma-induced increase of risk of traffic accident[38] could counterbalance the disadvantage of the rarer allele and could be responsible both for the initial spread of the RhD allele among the RhD-negative population and for a stable RhD polymorphism in most human populations. It was also suggested that differences in the prevalence of Toxoplasma infection between geographical regions (0ÿ95%) could also explain the striking variation in the frequency of RhD-negative alleles between populations. According to some parasitologists,[36] it is possible that the better psychomotor performance of RhD-negative subjects in the Toxoplasma-free population could be the reason for spreading of the d allele (deletion) in the European population. In contrast to the situation in Africa and certain (but not all) regions of Asia, the abundance of wild cats (definitive hosts of Toxoplasma gondii) in Europe was very low before the advent of the domestic cat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn serologic testing, D positive blood is easily identified. Units which are D negative are often retested to rule out a weaker reaction. This was previously referred to as Du, which has been replaced.[42]:322 By definition, weak D phenotype is characterized by negative reaction with anti-D reagent at immediate spin (IS), negative reaction after 37?C incubation, and positive reaction at anti-human globulin (AHG) phase. Weak D phenotype can occur in several ways. In some cases, this phenotype occurs because of an altered surface protein that is more common in people of European descent. An inheritable form also occurs, as a result of a weakened form of the R0 gene. Weak D may also occur as \\"C in trans\\", whereby a C gene is present on the opposite chromosome to a D gene (as in the combination R0r', or \\"Dce/dCe\\"). The testing is difficult, since using different anti-D reagents, especially the older polyclonal reagents, may give different results.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe practical implication of this is that people with this sub-phenotype will have a product labeled as \\"D positive\\" when donating blood. When receiving blood, they are sometimes typed as a \\"D negative\\", though this is the subject of some debate. Most \\"Weak D\\" patients can receive \\"D positive\\" blood without complications.[42]:323 However, it is important to correctly identify the ones that have to be considered D+ or D?. This is important, since most blood banks have a limited supply of \\"D negative\\" blood and the correct transfusion is clinically relevant. In this respect, genotyping of blood groups has much simplified this detection of the various variants in the Rh blood group system.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to differentiate weak D (due to a quantitative difference in the D antigen) from partial D (due to a qualitative difference in the D antigen). Simply put, the weak D phenotype is due to a reduced number of D antigens on a red blood cell. In contrast, the partial D phenotype is due to an alteration in D-epitopes. Thus, in partial D, the number of D antigens is not reduced but the protein structure is altered. These individuals, if alloimmunized to D, can produce an anti-D antibody. Therefore, partial D patients who are donating blood should be labeled as D-positive but, if receiving blood, they should be labeled as D-negative and receive D-negative units.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, partial D was called 'D mosaic' or 'D variant.' Different partial D phenotypes are defined by different D epitopes on the outer surface of the red blood cell membrane. More than 30 different partial D phenotypes have been described.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nRhnull individuals have no Rh antigens (no Rh or RhAG) on their red blood cells.[43] This condition is rare.[43] As a consequence of Rh antigen absence, Rhnull red blood cells also lack LW and Fy5 and show weak expression of S, s, and U antigens. Red blood cells lacking Rh/RhAG proteins have structural abnormalities (such as stomatocytosis) and cell membrane defects that can result in hemolytic anemia.[31][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, 50 antigens have been described in the Rh group system; among those described here, the D, C, c, E and e antigens are the most important. The others are much less frequently encountered or are rarely clinically significant. Each is given a number, though the highest assigned number (CEST or RH57 according to the ISBT terminology) is not an accurate reflection of the antigens encountered since many (e.g. Rh38) have been combined, reassigned to other groups, or otherwise removed.[42]:324\\r\\n\\r\\nRh antibodies are IgG antibodies which are acquired through exposure to Rh-positive blood (generally either through pregnancy or transfusion of blood products). The D antigen is the most immunogenic of all the non-ABO antigens.  Approximately 80% of individuals who are D-negative and exposed to a single D-positive unit will produce an anti-D antibody. The percentage of alloimmunization is significantly reduced in patients who are actively exsanguinating.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Rh antibodies except D display dosage (antibody reacts more strongly with red cells homozygous for an antigen than cells heterozygous for the antigen (EE stronger reaction vs Ee).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf anti-E is detected, the presence of anti-c should be strongly suspected (due to combined genetic inheritance). It is therefore common to select c-negative and E-negative blood for transfusion patients who have an anti-E. Anti-c is a common cause of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions.[31]","input":"What is another name for the rh antigen?"},{"output":"Grmur J܇nsson Thorkelin","context":"Beowulf (/?be???w?lf/;[2] Old English:?[?be?o??wulf]) is an Old English epic poem consisting of 3,182 alliterative lines.

It has no title in the original manuscript, but has become known by the name of the story's protagonist.[5] In 1731, the manuscript was badly damaged by a fire that swept through Ashburnham House in London that had a collection of medieval manuscripts assembled by Sir Robert Bruce Cotton.[6] The Nowell Codex is currently housed in the British Library.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events in the poem take place over most of the sixth century, after the Anglo-Saxons had started migrating to England and before the beginning of the seventh century, a time when the Anglo-Saxons were either newly arrived or were still in close contact with their Germanic kinsmen in Northern Germany and southern Scandinavia. The poem may have been brought to England by people of Geatish origins.[7] Many suggest that Beowulf was first composed in the 7th century at Rendlesham in East Anglia, that the Sutton Hoo ship-burial also shows close connections with Scandinavia, and that the East Anglian royal dynasty, the Wuffingas, may have been descendants of the Geatish Wulfings.[8][9] Others have associated this poem with the court of King Alfred the Great or with the court of King Cnut the Great.[10]\\r\\nThe poem deals with legends, was composed for entertainment, and does not separate between fictional elements and historic events, such as the raid by King Hygelac into Frisia. Though Beowulf himself is not mentioned in any other Anglo-Saxon manuscript,[11] scholars generally agree that many of the other figures referred to in Beowulf also appear in Scandinavian sources. (Specific works are designated in the following section).[12] This concerns not only individuals (e.g., Healfdene, Hroegar, Halga, Hroeulf, Eadgils and Ohthere), but also clans (e.g., Scyldings, Scylfings and Wulfings) and certain events (e.g., the Battle on the Ice of Lake V?nern).\\r\\nThe dating of the events in the epic poem has been confirmed by archaeological excavations of the barrows in Uppland, Sweden, indicated by Snorri Sturluson and by Swedish tradition as the graves of Ohthere (dated to c. 530) and his son Eadgils (dated to c. 575).[13][14][15]\\r\\nIn Denmark, recent archaeological excavations at Lejre, where Scandinavian tradition located the seat of the Scyldings, i.e., Heorot, have revealed that a hall was built in the mid-6th century, exactly the time period of Beowulf.[16] Three halls, each about 50 metres (160?ft) long, were found during the excavation.[16]\\r\\nThe majority view appears to be that people such as King Hroegar and the Scyldings in Beowulf are based on historical people from 6th-century Scandinavia.[17] Like the Finnesburg Fragment and several shorter surviving poems, Beowulf has consequently been used as a source of information about Scandinavian figures such as Eadgils and Hygelac, and about continental Germanic figures such as Offa, king of the continental Angles.\\r\\n19th-century archaeological evidence may confirm elements of the Beowulf story. Eadgils was buried at Uppsala according to Snorri Sturluson. When Eadgils' mound (to the left in the photo) was excavated in 1874, the finds supported Beowulf and the sagas. They showed that a powerful man was buried in a large barrow, c. 575, on a bear skin with two dogs and rich grave offerings. These remains include a Frankish sword adorned with gold and garnets and a tafl game with Roman pawns of ivory. He was dressed in a costly suit made of Frankish cloth with golden threads, and he wore a belt with a costly buckle. There were four cameos from the Middle East which were probably part of a casket. This would have been a burial fitting a king who was famous for his wealth in Old Norse sources. Ongentheow's barrow has not been excavated.[13][14]\\r\\nThe protagonist Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, king of the Danes, whose great hall, Heorot, is plagued by the monster Grendel. Beowulf kills Grendel with his bare hands and Grendel's mother with a giant's sword that he found in her lair.\\r\\nLater in his life, Beowulf becomes king of the Geats, and finds his realm terrorized by a dragon, some of whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound. He attacks the dragon with the help of his thegns or servants, but they do not succeed. Beowulf decides to follow the dragon to its lair at Earnan?s, but only his young Swedish relative Wiglaf, whose name means \\"remnant of valour\\",[a] dares to join him. Beowulf finally slays the dragon, but is mortally wounded in the struggle. He is cremated and a burial mound by the sea is erected in his honour.\\r\\nBeowulf is considered an epic poem in that the main character is a hero who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts. The poem also begins in medias res or simply, \\"in the middle of things,\\" which is a characteristic of the epics of antiquity. Although the poem begins with Beowulf's arrival, Grendel's attacks have been an ongoing event. An elaborate history of characters and their lineages is spoken of, as well as their interactions with each other, debts owed and repaid, and deeds of valour. The warriors form a kind of brotherhood linked by loyalty to their lord. What is unique about \\"Beowulf\\" is that the poem actually begins and ends with a funeral. At the beginning of the poem, the king, hero, Shield Shiefson dies (26ÿ45) and there is a huge funeral for him. At the end of the poem when Beowulf dies, there is also a massive funeral for Beowulf (3140ÿ3170).\\r\\nBeowulf begins with the story of Hrothgar, who constructed the great hall Heorot for himself and his warriors. In it, he, his wife Wealhtheow, and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating. Grendel, a troll-like monster said to be descended from the biblical Cain, is pained by the sounds of joy.[20] Grendel attacks the hall and kills and devours many of Hrothgar's warriors while they sleep. Hrothgar and his people, helpless against Grendel, abandon Heorot.\\r\\nBeowulf, a young warrior from Geatland, hears of Hrothgar's troubles and with his king's permission leaves his homeland to assist Hrothgar.[21]\\r\\nBeowulf and his men spend the night in Heorot. Beowulf refuses to use any weapon because he holds himself to be the equal of Grendel.[22] When Grendel enters the hall, Beowulf, who has been feigning sleep, leaps up to clench Grendel's hand.[23] Grendel and Beowulf battle each other violently.[24] Beowulf's retainers draw their swords and rush to his aid, but their blades cannot pierce Grendel's skin.[25] Finally, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm from his body at the shoulder and Grendel runs to his home in the marshes where he dies.[26] Beowulf displays \\"the whole of Grendel's shoulder and arm, his awesome grasp\\" for all to see at Heorot. This display would fuel Grendel's mother's anger in revenge.[27]\\r\\nThe next night, after celebrating Grendel's defeat, Hrothgar and his men sleep in Heorot. Grendel's mother, angry that her son has been killed, sets out to get revenge. \\"Beowulf was elsewhere. Earlier, after the award of treasure, The Geat had been given another lodging\\"; his assistance would be absent in this battle.[28] Grendel's mother violently kills ?schere, who is Hrothgar's most loyal fighter, and escapes.\\r\\nHrothgar, Beowulf, and their men track Grendel's mother to her lair under a lake. Unferth, a warrior who had doubted him and wishes to make amends, presents Beowulf with his sword Hrunting. After stipulating a number of conditions to Hrothgar in case of his death (including the taking in of his kinsmen and the inheritance by Unferth of Beowulf's estate), Beowulf jumps into the lake, at the bottom of which he finds a cavern containing Grendel's body and the remains of men that the two have killed. Grendel's mother and Beowulf engage in fierce combat.\\r\\nAt first, Grendel's mother appears to prevail. Beowulf, finding that Hrunting cannot harm his foe, puts it aside in fury. Beowulf is again saved from his opponent's attack by his armour. Beowulf takes another sword from Grendel's mother and slices her head off with it. Travelling further into Grendel's mother's lair, Beowulf discovers Grendel's corpse and severs his head. The blade of Beowulf's sword touches Grendel's toxic blood, and instantly dissolves so that only the hilt remains. Beowulf swims back up to the rim of the pond where his men wait in growing despair. Carrying the hilt of the sword and Grendel's head, he presents them to Hrothgar upon his return to Heorot. Hrothgar gives Beowulf many gifts, including the sword N?gling, his family's heirloom. The events prompt a long reflection by the king, sometimes referred to as \\"Hrothgar's sermon\\", in which he urges Beowulf to be wary of pride and to reward his thegns.[29]\\r\\nBeowulf returns home and eventually becomes king of his own people. One day, fifty years after Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother, a slave steals a golden cup from the lair of a dragon at Earnan?s. When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, it leaves its cave in a rage, burning everything in sight. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon, but Beowulf tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone and that they should wait on the barrow. Beowulf descends to do battle with the dragon, but finds himself outmatched. His men, upon seeing this and fearing for their lives, retreat into the woods. One of his men, Wiglaf, however, in great distress at Beowulf's plight, comes to his aid. The two slay the dragon, but Beowulf is mortally wounded. After Beowulf dies, Wiglaf remains by his side, grief-stricken. When the rest of the men finally return, Wiglaf bitterly admonishes them, blaming their cowardice for Beowulf's death. Afterward, Beowulf is ritually burned on a great pyre in Geatland while his people wail and mourn him, fearing that without him, the Geats are defenceless against attacks from surrounding tribes. Afterwards, a barrow, visible from the sea, is built in his memory (Beowulf lines 2712ÿ3182).[30]\\r\\nBeowulf was written in England, but is set in Scandinavia; its dating has attracted considerable scholarly attention. The poem has been dated to between the 8th and the early 11th centuries, with some recent scholarship offering what has been called \\"a cohesive and compelling case for Beowulf's early composition.\\"[31][32] However, opinion differs as to whether the composition of the poem is nearly contemporary with its transcription, whether it was first written in the 8th century, or if a proto-version of the poem was perhaps composed at an even earlier time (possibly as one of the Bear's Son Tales) and orally transmitted for many years, then transcribed in its present form at a later date. Albert Lord felt strongly that the manuscript represents the transcription of a performance, though likely taken at more than one sitting.[33] J. R. R. Tolkien believed that the poem retains too genuine a memory of Anglo-Saxon paganism to have been composed more than a few generations after the completion of the Christianisation of England around AD 700,[34] and Tolkien's conviction that the poem dates to the 8th century has been defended by Tom Shippey, Leonard Neidorf, Rafael J. Pascual, and R.D. Fulk, among others.[35][36][37]\\r\\nThe claim to an early 11th-century date depends in part on scholars who argue that, rather than the transcription of a tale from the oral tradition by an earlier literate monk, Beowulf reflects an original interpretation of an earlier version of the story by the manuscript's two scribes. On the other hand, some scholars argue that linguistic, palaeographical, metrical, and onomastic considerations align to support a date of composition in the first half of the eighth century;[32][38][39][40] in particular, the poem's regular observation of etymological length distinctions (Max Kaluza's law) has been thought to demonstrate a date of composition in the first half of the eighth century.[36][37] However, scholars disagree about whether the metrical phenomena described by Kaluza's Law prove an early date of composition or are evidence of a longer prehistory of the Beowulf meter;[41] B.R. Hutcheson, for instance, does not believe Kaluza's Law can be used to date the poem, while claiming that \\"the weight of all the evidence Fulk presents in his book[b] tells strongly in favour of an eighth-century date.\\"[42]\\r\\nBeowulf survives in a single manuscript dated on palaeographical grounds to the late 10th or early 11th century. The manuscript measures 245 G 185?mm.[43]\\r\\nThe poem is known only from a single manuscript, which is estimated to date from close to AD 1000, in which it appears with other works. The Beowulf manuscript is known as the Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar Laurence Nowell. The official designation is \\"British Library, Cotton Vitellius A.XV\\" because it was one of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton's holdings in the Cotton library in the middle of the 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own library classification systems. \\"Cotton Vitellius A.XV\\" translates as: the 15th book from the left on shelf A (the top shelf) of the bookcase with the bust of Roman Emperor Vitellius standing on top of it, in Cotton's collection. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil's household as a tutor to his ward, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.[44]\\r\\nThe earliest extant reference to the first foliation of the Nowell Codex was made sometime between 1628 and 1650 by Franciscus Junius (the younger).[45]:91 The ownership of the codex before Nowell remains a mystery.[45]:120\\r\\nThe Reverend Thomas Smith (1638ÿ1710) and Humfrey Wanley (1672ÿ1726) both catalogued the Cotton library (in which the Nowell Codex was held). Smith's catalogue appeared in 1696, and Wanley's in 1705.[46] The Beowulf manuscript itself is identified by name for the first time in an exchange of letters in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley's assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the Beowulf script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley \\"I can find nothing yet of Beowulph.\\"[47] Kiernan theorised that Smith failed to mention the Beowulf manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea how to describe it or because it was temporarily out of the codex.[48]\\r\\nIt suffered damage in the Cotton Library fire at Ashburnham House in 1731. Since then, parts of the manuscript have crumbled along with many of the letters. Rebinding efforts, though saving the manuscript from much degeneration, have nonetheless covered up other letters of the poem, causing further loss. Kevin Kiernan, in preparing his electronic edition of the manuscript, used fibre-optic backlighting and ultraviolet lighting to reveal letters in the manuscript lost from binding, erasure, or ink blotting.[49]\\r\\nThe Beowulf manuscript was transcribed from an original by two scribes, one of whom wrote the prose at the beginning of the manuscript and the first 1939 lines before breaking off in mid sentence. The first scribe made a point of carefully regularizing the spelling of the original document by using the common West Saxon language and by avoiding any archaic or dialectical features. The second scribe, who wrote the remainder, with a difference in handwriting noticeable after line 1939, seems to have written more vigorously and with less interest. As a result, the second scribe's script retains more archaic dialectic features which allow modern scholars to ascribe the poem a cultural context.[50] While both scribes appear to proofread their work, there are nevertheless many errors.[51] The second scribe was ultimately the more conservative copyist of the two as he did not modify the spelling of the text as he wrote but rather copied what he saw in front of him. In the way that it is currently bound, the Beowulf manuscript is followed by the Old English poem Judith. Judith was written by the same scribe that completed Beowulf as evidenced through similar writing style. Worm-holes found in the last leaves of the Beowulf manuscript that aren't present in the Judith manuscript suggest that at one point Beowulf ended the volume. The rubbed appearance of some leaves also suggest that the manuscript stood on a shelf unbound, as is known to have been the case with other Old English manuscripts.[50] From knowledge of books held in the library at Malmesbury Abbey and available as source works, and from the identification of certain words particular to the local dialect found in the text, the transcription may have taken place there.[52]\\r\\nIcelandic scholar Grmur J܇nsson Thorkelin made the first transcriptions of the manuscript in 1786 and published the results in 1815, working as part of a Danish government historical research commission. He made one himself, and had another done by a professional copyist who knew no Anglo-Saxon. Since that time, however, the manuscript has crumbled further, making these transcripts a prized witness to the text. While the recovery of at least 2000 letters can be attributed to them, their accuracy has been called into question,[c] and the extent to which the manuscript was actually more readable in Thorkelin's time is uncertain.\\r\\nMain article: List of translations and artistic depictions of Beowulf\\r\\nA great number of translations and adaptations are available, in poetry and prose. Andy Orchard, in A Critical Companion to Beowulf, lists 33 \\"representative\\" translations in his bibliography,[54] while the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies published Marijane Osborn's annotated list of over 300 translations and adaptations in 2003.[55] Beowulf has been translated into at least 23 other languages.[56]\\r\\n19th century\\r\\nIn 1805, the historian Sharon Turner translated selected verses into modern English.[57] This was followed in 1814 by John Josias Conybeare who published an edition \\"in English paraphrase and Latin verse translation.\\"[57] In 1815, Grmur J܇nsson Thorkelin published the first complete edition in Latin.[57] N. F. S. Grundtvig reviewed this edition in 1815 and created the first complete verse translation in Danish in 1820.[57] In 1837, John Mitchell Kemble created an important literal translation in English.[57] In 1895, William Morris & A. J. Wyatt published the ninth English translation.[57] Many retellings of Beowulf for children began appearing in the 20th century.[58]\\r\\n20th century\\r\\nIn 1909, Francis Barton Gummere's full translation in \\"English imitative meter\\" was published,[57] and was used as the text of Gareth Hinds's graphic novel based on Beowulf in 2007.\\r\\nFirst published in 1928, Frederick Klaeber's Beowulf and The Fight at Finnsburg[59] (which included the poem in Old English, an extensive glossary of Old English terms, and general background information) became the \\"central source used by graduate students for the study of the poem and by scholars and teachers as the basis of their translations.\\"[60]\\r\\nFollowing research in the King's College London Archives, Carl Kears proposed that John Porter's translation, published in 1975 by Bill Griffiths' Pirate Press, was the first complete verse translation of the poem entirely accompanied by facing-page Old English.[61]\\r\\nSeamus Heaney's 1999 translation of the poem (referred to by Howell Chickering and many others as \\"Heaneywulf\\"[62]) was widely publicized.\\r\\n21st century\\r\\nR. D. Fulk, of Indiana University, published the first facing-page edition and translation of the entire Nowell Codex manuscript in the Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library series in 2010.[63]\\r\\nTranslating Beowulf is one of the subjects of the 2012 publication Beowulf at Kalamazoo, containing a section with 10 essays on translation, and a section with 22 reviews of Heaney's translation (some of which compare Heaney's work with that of Anglo-Saxon scholar Roy Liuzza).[64]\\r\\nJ. R. R. Tolkien's long-awaited translation (edited by his son, Christopher) was published in 2014 as Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary.[65][66] This also includes Tolkien's own retelling of the story of Beowulf in his tale, Sellic Spell.\\r\\nThe question of whether Beowulf was passed down through oral tradition prior to its present manuscript form has been the subject of much debate, and involves more than simply the issue of its composition. Rather, given the implications of the theory of oral-formulaic composition and oral tradition, the question concerns how the poem is to be understood, and what sorts of interpretations are legitimate.\\r\\nScholarly discussion about Beowulf in the context of the oral tradition was extremely active throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The debate might be framed starkly as follows: on the one hand, we can hypothesise a poem put together from various tales concerning the hero (the Grendel episode, the Grendel's mother story, and the fire drake narrative). These fragments would have been told for many years in tradition, and learned by apprenticeship from one generation of illiterate poets to the next. The poem is composed orally and extemporaneously, and the archive of tradition on which it draws is oral, pagan, Germanic, heroic, and tribal. On the other hand, one might posit a poem which is composed by a literate scribe, who acquired literacy by way of learning Latin (and absorbing Latinate culture and ways of thinking), probably a monk and therefore profoundly Christian in outlook. On this view, the pagan references would be a sort of decorative archaising.[67][68] There is a third view that sees merit in both arguments above and attempts to bridge them, and so cannot be articulated as starkly as they can; it sees more than one Christianity and more than one attitude towards paganism at work in the poem; it sees the poem as initially the product of a literate Christian author with one foot in the pagan world and one in the Christian, himself perhaps a convert (or one whose forebears had been pagan), a poet who was conversant in both oral and literary composition and was capable of a masterful \\"repurposing\\" of poetry from the oral tradition.\\r\\nHowever, scholars such as D.K. Crowne have proposed the idea that the poem was passed down from reciter to reciter under the theory of oral-formulaic composition, which hypothesises that epic poems were (at least to some extent) improvised by whoever was reciting them, and only much later written down. In his landmark work, The Singer of Tales, Albert Lord refers to the work of Francis Peabody Magoun and others, saying \\"the documentation is complete, thorough, and accurate. This exhaustive analysis is in itself sufficient to prove that Beowulf was composed orally.\\"[69]\\r\\nExamination of Beowulf and other Old English literature for evidence of oral-formulaic composition has met with mixed response. While \\"themes\\" (inherited narrative subunits for representing familiar classes of event, such as the \\"arming the hero\\",[70] or the particularly well-studied \\"hero on the beach\\" theme[71]) do exist across Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic works, some scholars conclude that Anglo-Saxon poetry is a mix of oral-formulaic and literate patterns, arguing that the poems both were composed on a word-by-word basis and followed larger formulae and patterns.[72]\\r\\nLarry Benson argued that the interpretation of Beowulf as an entirely formulaic work diminishes the ability of the reader to analyse the poem in a unified manner, and with due attention to the poet's creativity. Instead, he proposed that other pieces of Germanic literature contain \\"kernels of tradition\\" from which Beowulf borrows and expands upon.[73][74] A few years later, Ann Watts argued against the imperfect application of one theory to two different traditions: traditional, Homeric, oral-formulaic poetry and Anglo-Saxon poetry.[74][75] Thomas Gardner agreed with Watts, arguing that the Beowulf text is of too varied a nature to be completely constructed from set formulae and themes.[74][76]\\r\\nJohn Miles Foley wrote, referring to the Beowulf debate,[77] that while comparative work was both necessary and valid, it must be conducted with a view to the particularities of a given tradition; Foley argued with a view to developments of oral traditional theory that do not assume, or depend upon, ultimately unverifiable assumptions about composition, and instead delineate a more fluid continuum of traditionality and textuality.[78][79][80][70]\\r\\nFinally, in the view of Ursula Schaefer, the question of whether the poem was \\"oral\\" or \\"literate\\" becomes something of a red herring.[81] In this model, the poem is created, and is interpretable, within both noetic horizons. Schaefer's concept of \\"vocality\\" offers neither a compromise nor a synthesis of the views which see the poem as on the one hand Germanic, pagan, and oral and on the other Latin-derived, Christian, and literate, but, as stated by Monika Otter: \\"...?a 'tertium quid', a modality that participates in both oral and literate culture yet also has a logic and aesthetic of its own.\\"[82]\\r\\nNeither identified sources nor analogues for Beowulf can be definitively proven, but many conjectures have been made. These are important in helping historians understand the Beowulf manuscript, as possible source-texts or influences would suggest time-frames of composition, geographic boundaries within which it could be composed, or range (both spatial and temporal) of influence (i.e. when it was \\"popular\\" and where its \\"popularity\\" took it).\\r\\nThere are Scandinavian sources, international folkloric sources, and Celtic sources.[d][83]\\r\\n19th century studies proposed that Beowulf was translated from a lost original Scandinavian work, but this idea was quickly abandoned. But Scandinavian works have continued to be studied as a possible source.[84] Proponents included Gregor Sarrazin?(de) writing in 1886 that an Old Norse original version of Beowulf must have existed,[85] but that view was later debunked by Carl Wilhelm von Sydow?(de) (1914) who pointed out that Beowulf is fundamentally Christian and written at a time when any Norse tale would have most likely been pagan.[86]\\r\\nThe epic's possible connection to Grettis saga was made early on by Guebrandur Vigf~sson (1878).[87]\\r\\nGrettis saga is a family saga, and a story about Grettir smundarson?(is), a great-grandson of an Icelandic settler, cannot be comparably as old as Beowulf. Axel Olrik (1903) claimed that on the contrary, this saga was a reworking of Beowulf, and others had followed suit.[85]\\r\\nHowever, Friedrich Panzer?(de) (1910) wrote a thesis in which both Beowulf and Grettis saga drew from a common folkloric source, and this encouraged even a detractor such W. W. Lawrence to reposition his view, and entertain the possibility that certain elements in the saga (such as the waterfall in place of the mere) retained an older form.[85]\\r\\nThe viability of this connection has enjoyed enduring support, and was characterized as one of the few Scandinavian analogues to receive a general consensus of potential connection by Theodore M. Andersson?(de) (1998).[88] But that same year, Magn~s Fjalldal published a volume challenging the perception that there is a close parallel, and that tangential similarities were being overemphasized as analogies.[89]\\r\\nAnother candidate for a cogener analogue or possible source is the story of Hrolf kraki and his servant, the legendary bear-shapeshifter Bodvar Bjarki. The story survives in Old Norse Hr܇lfs saga kraka and Saxo's Gesta Danorum. Hrolf kraki, one of the Skj?ldungs, even appears as \\"Hrothulf\\" in the Anglo-Saxon epic. Hence a story about him and his followers may have developed as early as the 6th century.[90]\\r\\nFriedrich Panzer (1910) wrote a thesis that the first part of Beowulf (the Grendel Story) incorporated preexisting folktale material, and that the folktale in question was of the Bear's Son Tale (B?rensohnm?rchen) type, which has surviving examples all over the world.[91][85]\\r\\nThis tale type was later catalogued as international folktale type 301, now formally entitled \\"The Three Stolen Princesses\\" type in Hans Uther's catalogue, although the \\"Bear's Son\\" is still used in Beowulf criticism, if not so much in folkloristic circles.[85]\\r\\nHowever, although this folkloristic approach was seen as a step in the right direction, \\"The Bear's Son\\" tale has later been regarded by many as not a close enough parallel to be a viable choice.[92] Later, Peter J?rgensen, looking for a more concise frame of reference, coined a \\"two-troll tradition\\" that covers both Beowulf and Grettis saga: \\"a Norse 'ecotype' in which a hero enters a cave and kills two giants, usually of different sexes\\";[93] which has emerged as a more attractive folk tale parallel, according to a 1998 assessment by Andersson?(Andersson|de).[94][95]\\r\\nSimilarity of the epic to the Irish folktale \\"The Hand and the Child\\" had already been noted by Albert S. Cook (1899), and others even earlier,[e][96][86][f] Swedish folklorist Carl Wilhelm von Sydow?(de) (1914) then made a strong argument for the case of parallelism in \\"The Hand and the Child\\", because the folktale type demonstrated a \\"monstrous arm\\" motif that corresponded with Beowulf wrenching off Grendel's arm. For no such correspondence could be perceived in the Bear's Son Tale or Grettis saga.[g][97][96]\\r\\nJames Carney and Martin Puhvel also agree with this \\"Hand and the Child\\" contextualisation.[h] Puhvel supported the \\"Hand and the Child\\" theory through such motifs as (in Andersson's words) \\"the more powerful giant mother, the mysterious light in the cave, the melting of the sword in blood, the phenomenon of battle rage, swimming prowess, combat with water monsters, underwater adventures, and the bear-hug style of wrestling.\\"[98]\\r\\nAttempts to find classical or Late Latin influence or analogue in Beowulf are almost exclusively linked with Homer's Odyssey or Virgil's Aeneid. In 1926, Albert S. Cook suggested a Homeric connection due to equivalent formulas, metonymies, and analogous voyages.[99] In 1930, James A. Work also supported the Homeric influence, stating that encounter between Beowulf and Unferth was parallel to the encounter between Odysseus and Euryalus in Books 7ÿ8 of the Odyssey, even to the point of both characters giving the hero the same gift of a sword upon being proven wrong in their initial assessment of the hero's prowess. This theory of Homer's influence on Beowulf remained very prevalent in the 1920s, but started to die out in the following decade when a handful of critics stated that the two works were merely \\"comparative literature\\",[100] although Greek was known in late 7th century England: Bede states that Theodore of Tarsus, a Greek, was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 668, and he taught Greek. Several English scholars and churchmen are described by Bede as being fluent in Greek due to being taught by him; Bede claims to be fluent in Greek himself.[101]\\r\\nFrederick Klaeber, among others, argued for a connection between Beowulf and Virgil near the start of the 20th century, claiming that the very act of writing a secular epic in a Germanic world represents Virgilian influence. Virgil was seen as the pinnacle of Latin literature, and Latin was the dominant literary language of England at the time, therefore making Virgilian influence highly likely.[102] Similarly, in 1971, Alistair Campbell stated that the apologue technique used in Beowulf is so rare in epic poetry aside from Virgil that the poet who composed Beowulf could not have written the poem in such a manner without first coming across Virgil's writings.[103]\\r\\nIt cannot be denied that Biblical parallels occur in the text, whether seen as a pagan work with \\"Christian colouring\\" added by scribes or as a \\"Christian historical novel, with selected bits of paganism deliberately laid on as 'local colour',\\" as Margaret E. Goldsmith did in \\"The Christian Theme of Beowulf,\\".[104] Beowulf channels the Book of Genesis, the Book of Exodus, and the Book of Daniel[105] in its inclusion of references to the Genesis creation narrative, the story of Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, the Devil, Hell, and the Last Judgment.[104]\\r\\nThe poem mixes the West Saxon and Anglian dialects of Old English, though it predominantly uses West Saxon, as do other Old English poems copied at the time.[106]\\r\\nThere is a wide array of linguistic forms in the Beowulf manuscript. It is this fact that leads some scholars to believe that Beowulf has endured a long and complicated transmission through all the main dialect areas.[107] The poem retains a complicated mix of the following dialectical forms: Mercian, Northumbrian, Early West Saxon, Kentish and Late West Saxon.[45]:20ÿ21 There are in Beowulf more than 3100 distinct words, and almost 1300 occur exclusively, or almost exclusively, in this poem and in the other poetical texts. Considerably more than one-third of the total vocabulary is alien from ordinary prose use. There are, in round numbers, three hundred and sixty uncompounded verbs in Beowulf, and forty of them are poetical words in the sense that they are unrecorded or rare in the existing prose writings. One hundred and fifty more occur with the prefix ge- (reckoning a few found only in the past-participle), but of these one hundred occur also as simple verbs, and the prefix is employed to render a shade of meaning which was perfectly known and thoroughly familiar except in the latest Anglo-Saxon period. The nouns number sixteen hundred. Seven hundred of them, including those formed with prefixes, of which fifty (or considerably more than half) have ge-, are simple nouns, at the highest reckoning not more than one-quarter is absent in prose. That this is due in some degree to accident is clear from the character of the words, and from the fact that several reappear and are common after the Norman Conquest.[108]\\r\\nAn Old English poem such as Beowulf is very different from modern poetry. Anglo-Saxon poets typically used alliterative verse, a form of verse in which the first half of the line (the a-verse) is linked to the second half (the b-verse) through similarity in initial sound. In addition, the two halves are divided by a caesura: \\"Oft Scyld Scefing \\\\\\\\ sceatena treatum\\" (l. 4). This verse form maps stressed and unstressed syllables onto abstract entities known as metrical positions. There is no fixed number of beats per line: the first one cited has three (Oft SCYLD SCEFING, with ictus on the suffix -ING) whereas the second has two (SCEAtena TREATum).\\r\\nThe poet has a choice of epithets or formulae to use in order to fulfil the alliteration. When speaking or reading Old English poetry, it is important to remember for alliterative purposes that many of the letters are not pronounced in the same way as in modern English. The letter ?h?, for example, is always pronounced (Hroegar: [?hroegar]), and the digraph ?cg? is pronounced [d?], as in the word edge. Both ?f? and ?s? vary in pronunciation depending on their phonetic environment. Between vowels or voiced consonants, they are voiced, sounding like modern ?v? and ?z?, respectively. Otherwise they are unvoiced, like modern ?f? in fat and ?s? in sat. Some letters which are no longer found in modern English, such as thorn, ?t?, and eth, ?e? ÿ representing both pronunciations of modern English ?th?, as /Ĳ/ in thing and /e/ this ÿ are used extensively both in the original manuscript and in modern English editions. The voicing of these characters echoes that of ?f? and ?s?. Both are voiced (as in this) between other voiced sounds: oeer, latleas, sutern. Otherwise they are unvoiced (as in thing): tunor, sue, sotf?st.\\r\\nKennings are also a significant technique in Beowulf. They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre. For example, a poet might call the sea the \\"swan-road\\" or the \\"whale-road\\"; a king might be called a \\"ring-giver.\\" There are many kennings in Beowulf, and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in Old English, which is heavily formulaic. The poem also makes extensive use of elided metaphors.[109]\\r\\nJ. R. R. Tolkien argued in Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics that the poem is not an epic, and while no conventional term exactly fits, the nearest would be elegy.[110]\\r\\nThe history of modern Beowulf criticism is often said to begin with J. R. R. Tolkien,[111] author and Merton professor of Anglo-Saxon at University of Oxford, who in his 1936 lecture to the British Academy criticised his contemporaries' excessive interest in its historical implications.[112][citation not found] He noted in Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics that as a result the poem's literary value had been largely overlooked and argued that the poem \\"is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content...\\"[113]\\r\\nIn historical terms, the poem's characters would have been Norse pagans (the historical events of the poem took place before the Christianisation of Scandinavia), yet the poem was recorded by Christian Anglo-Saxons who had mostly converted from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism around the 7th century ÿ both Anglo-Saxon paganism and Norse paganism share a common origin as both are forms of Germanic paganism. Beowulf thus depicts a Germanic warrior society, in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance.[114]\\r\\nIn terms of the relationship between characters in Beowulf to God, one might recall the substantial amount of paganism that is present throughout the work. Literary critics such as Fred C. Robinson argue that the Beowulf poet arguably tries to send a message to readers during the Anglo-Saxon time period regarding the state of Christianity in their own time. Robinson argues that the intensified religious aspects of the Anglo-Saxon period inherently shape the way in which the Poet alludes to paganism as presented in Beowulf. The Poet arguably calls on Anglo-Saxon readers to recognize the imperfect aspects of their supposed Christian lifestyles. In other words, the Poet is referencing their \\"Anglo-Saxon Heathenism.\\" In terms of the characters of the epic itself, Robinson argues that readers are \\"impressed\\" by the courageous acts of Beowulf and the speeches of Hrothgar (181). But one is ultimately left to feel sorry for both men as they are fully detached from supposed \\"Christian truth\\" (181). The relationship between the characters of Beowulf, and the overall message of the Poet, regarding their relationship with God is largely debated among readers and literary critics alike.\\r\\nAt the same time, Richard North argues that the Beowulf poet interpreted \\"Danish myths in Christian form\\" (as the poem would have served as a form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: \\"As yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of Beowulf liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given... that Anglo-Saxons saw the Danes as 'heathens' rather than as foreigners.\\"[115] Grendel's mother and Grendel are described as descendants of Cain, a fact which some scholars link to the Cain tradition.[116]\\r\\nOther scholars disagree, however, as to the meaning and nature of the poem: is it a Christian work set in a Germanic pagan context? The question suggests that the conversion from the Germanic pagan beliefs to Christian ones was a prolonged and gradual process over several centuries, and it remains unclear the ultimate nature of the poem's message in respect to religious belief at the time it was written. Robert F. Yeager notes the facts that form the basis for these questions:\\r\\nThat the scribes of Cotton Vitellius A.XV were Christian beyond doubt, and it is equally sure that Beowulf was composed in a Christianised England since conversion took place in the sixth and seventh centuries. The only Biblical references in Beowulf are to the Old Testament, and Christ is never mentioned. The poem is set in pagan times, and none of the characters is demonstrably Christian. In fact, when we are told what anyone in the poem believes, we learn that they are pagans. Beowulf's own beliefs are not expressed explicitly. He offers eloquent prayers to a higher power, addressing himself to the \\"Father Almighty\\" or the \\"Wielder of All.\\" Were those the prayers of a pagan who used phrases the Christians subsequently appropriated? Or, did the poem's author intend to see Beowulf as a Christian Ur-hero, symbolically refulgent with Christian virtues?[117]\\r\\nThe location of the composition of the poem is also intensely disputed. In 1914, F.W. Moorman, the first professor of English Language at University of Leeds, claimed that Beowulf was composed in Yorkshire,[118] but E. Talbot Donaldson claims that it was probably composed more than twelve hundred years ago, during the first half of the eighth century, and that the writer was a native of what was then called West Mercia, located in the Western Midlands of England. However, the late tenth-century manuscript \\"which alone preserves the poem\\" originated in the kingdom of the West Saxons ÿ as it is more commonly known.[119] Donaldson wrote that \\"the poet who put the materials into their present form was a Christian and?... poem reflects a Christian tradition\\".[120]\\r\\nStanley B. Greenfield has suggested that references to the human body throughout Beowulf emphasise the relative position of thanes to their lord. He argues that the term \\"shoulder-companion\\" could refer to both a physical arm as well as a thane (Aeschere) who was very valuable to his lord (Hrothgar). With Aeschere's death, Hrothgar turns to Beowulf as his new \\"arm.\\"[121] Also, Greenfield argues the foot is used for the opposite effect, only appearing four times in the poem. It is used in conjunction with Unfere (a man described by Beowulf as weak, traitorous, and cowardly). Greenfield notes that Unfere is described as \\"at the king's feet\\" (line 499). Unfere is also a member of the foot troops, who, throughout the story, do nothing and \\"generally serve as backdrops for more heroic action.\\"[122]\\r\\nDaniel Podgorski has argued that the work is best understood as an examination of inter-generational vengeance-based conflict, or feuding.[123] In this context, the poem operates as an indictment of feuding conflicts as a function of its conspicuous, circuitous, and lengthy depiction of the Geatish-Swedish warscoming into contrast with the poem's depiction of the protagonist Beowulf as being disassociated from the ongoing feuds in every way.[123]","input":"Who transcribed the earliest known manuscript of beowulf?"},{"output":"Russia","context":"This is a list of the world's countries and their dependent territories by area, ranked by total area.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntries in this list include, but are not limited to, those in the ISO 3166-1 standard, which includes sovereign states and dependent territories.

These closely match the CIA World Factbook figures and similarly include coastal and territorial waters for the United States, but exclude coastal and territorial waters for China.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther explanation of disputed ranking: The dispute for world's third-largest country arose from the inclusion of coastal and territorial waters for the United States. This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA World Factbook and its previous iterations[10] against the information for United States on Encyclop?dia Britannica, particularly its footnote section.[7] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA World Factbook (from 1982 to 1996), the US was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610 sq km. However, in the 1997 edition, the US added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091 sq km). And then again in 2007, US added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517 sq km). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. In other words, no coastal or territorial water area was added to China's total area figure. The United States has a coastal water area of 109,362 sq km, and a territorial water area of 195,213 sq km, for a total of 304,575 sq km of additional water space. This is larger than entire countries like Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Adding this figure to the US will boost it over China in ranking since China's coastal and territorial water figures are currently unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure.","input":"What are the 5 biggest countries in the world?"},{"output":"Gold on Borax","context":"Sone Pe Suhaaga (English: Gold on Borax) is a 1988 Bollywood film produced by Abdul Hafiz Nadiadwala on A.

The dilemma stems from the observation that all chickens hatch from eggs and all chicken eggs are laid by chickens. \\"Chicken-and-egg\\" is a metaphoric adjective describing situations where it is not clear which of two events should be considered the cause and which should be considered the effect, or to express a scenario of infinite regress. Plutarch posed the question as a philosophical matter in his essay \\"The Symposiacs\\", written in the 1st century CE.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question represents an ancient folk paradox addressing the problem of origins and first cause.[3] Aristotle, writing in the fourth century B.C., would describe the problem.  He concluded that this was an infinite sequence, with no true origin.[3] Plutarch, writing four centuries later, specifically highlighted this question as bearing on a \\"great and weighty problem (whether the world had a beginning).\\"[4] In the fifth century CE, Macrobius wrote that while the question seemed trivial, it \\"should be regarded as one of importance.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the 16th century, the well-known question seemed to have been regarded as settled in the Christian world, based on the origin story of the Bible. In describing the creation of animals, it allows for a first chicken that did not come from an egg.  However, later enlightenment philosophers began to question this solution.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the question is typically used metaphorically, evolutionary biology provides literal answers, made possible by the Darwinian principle that species evolve over time, and thus that chickens had ancestors that were not chickens,[4] similar to a view expressed by the Greek philosopher Anaximander when addressing the paradox.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the question refers to eggs in general, the egg came first. The first amniote egg  that is, a hard-shelled egg that could be laid on land, rather than remaining in water like the eggs of fish or amphibians  appeared around 312 million years ago.[5] In contrast, chickens are domesticated descendants of red junglefowl and probably arose little more than eight thousand years ago, at most.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the question refers to chicken eggs specifically, the answer is still the egg,[7] but the explanation is more complicated. The process by which the chicken arose through the interbreeding and domestication of multiple species of wild jungle fowl is poorly understood, and the point at which this evolving organism became a chicken is a somewhat arbitrary distinction. Whatever criteria one chooses, an animal nearly identical to the modern chicken (i.e., a proto-chicken) laid a fertilized egg that had DNA identical to the modern chicken (due to mutations in the mother's ovum, the father's sperm, or the fertilised zygote).[8][4][9][10]  Put more simply by Neil deGrasse Tyson: \\"Which came first: the chicken or the egg? The egg  laid by a bird that was not a chicken.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternatively, if the question refers specifically to the chicken egg as it exists today, the answer may be different.  Chickens produce a protein, ovocleidin-17 (OC-17), that is expressed in the uterus and causes the formation of the thickened calcium carbonate shell around modern chicken eggs.  Because OC-17 is expressed by the hen and not the egg, the bird in which the protein first arose, though having hatched from a non-reinforced egg, would then have laid the first egg having such a reinforced shell: the chicken would have preceded this first \\"modern\\" chicken egg.[9][12]  This is only the case, however, if OC-17 arose after the domestication of their wild-fowl ancestors gave rise to chickens.","input":"What is first the chicken or the egg?"},{"output":"Lane Monte Kiffin","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nLane Monte Kiffin (born May 9, 1975) is an American football coach who is currently the head football coach at Florida Atlantic University.\\r\\n\\r\\nKiffin formerly served as the offensive coordinator for the USC Trojans football team from 2005 to 2006, head coach of the National Football League's Oakland Raiders from 2007 to 2008, head coach of the University of Tennessee Volunteers college football team in 2009, and head coach of the Trojans from 2010 to 2013. He was the youngest head coach in modern NFL history at the time when he joined the Raiders (until in 2017 when Sean McVay joined the Rams), and, for a time, was the youngest head coach of a BCS Conference team in college football.[1][2] Kiffin was the offensive coordinator at the University of Alabama from 2014 until 2016, when he was hired at Florida Atlantic.[3] Kiffin is the son of longtime NFL defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nKiffin graduated from Bloomington Jefferson High School in Minnesota in 1994,[5] and committed to Fresno State University to play college football. He played backup quarterback for the Bulldogs, giving up his senior season to become a Student Assistant Coach for position coach Jeff Tedford, who would later become the head coach at Cal in 2002. Kiffin graduated from Fresno State in 1998.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nKiffin worked as a graduate assistant for one year at Colorado State University.[7] In 1999, while he was working with the offensive line, the Rams played in the Liberty Bowl. Kiffin secured a job with the Jacksonville Jaguars of the NFL as a quality control assistant for one year.[8] He was then hired by head coach Pete Carroll as a tight ends coach at USC.\\r\\n\\r\\nKiffin began working with the University of Southern California (USC) staff during the 2001 season and became the wide receivers coach prior to the 2002 season. For the 2004 season, he added the duties of passing game coordinator, and he was promoted to offensive coordinator along with Steve Sarkisian for the 2005 season after Norm Chow left USC for the same position with the NFL's Tennessee Titans. In addition to his duties as offensive coordinator, Kiffin took the reins as recruiting coordinator that year. Along with these duties, Kiffin continued as the wide receivers coach. Under Kiffin and Sarkisian, the 2005 USC offense produced numerous school records, averaging 49.1 points and 579 yards per game and becoming the first in NCAA history to have a 3,000 yard passer (Matt Leinart), two 1,000 yard rushers (Reggie Bush and LenDale White), and a 1,000 yard receiver (Dwayne Jarrett). Steve Smith fell a few yards short of also surpassing 1,000 yards in receiving. In Kiffin's three years as recruiting coordinator at USC, the Trojans had the top ranked recruiting class in college football every year. The Trojans finished first in the Pac-10 in passing efficiency by averaging 142.8 passer rating, produced two, 1,000-yard receivers ÿ Dwayne Jarrett (1,105) and Steve Smith (1,083) ÿ and a 3,000-yard passer John David Booty, with 3,347 yards. The team produced top 20 statistics in most NCAA offensive categories and concluded with a 32ÿ18 win over the then #3 ranked team the University of Michigan in the Rose Bowl.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nKiffin helped guide USC to a 23ÿ3 record during his tenure as offensive coordinator, an 88.5% win percentage; however, in June 2010, the NCAA retroactively declared Reggie Bush ineligible for the entire 2005 season, and forced USC to vacate all of its 2005 wins. Litigation from former coach Todd McNair to overturn those vacancies is still ongoing.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nRaiders' owner Al Davis hired the 31 year-old Kiffin on January 23, 2007, making him the youngest head coach in Oakland Raiders history, and the youngest head coach in the NFL's \\"modern era\\" (since 1946), and signed Kiffin to a two-year contract worth about $4 million with a team option for 2009.[1] Pro Football Hall of Fame Coach John Madden was 32 when he was elevated to the head post by Davis in 1969. Davis had been known to select young, up-and-coming coaches in their thirties; those hires who fared well include John Madden, Mike Shanahan, and Jon Gruden. All have won Super Bowls, though Madden is the only one of the three to win a championship with the Raiders. Age 31 at the time of his hiring by the Raiders (32 when he coached his first game), Kiffin became the youngest head coach in modern NFL history; he also surpassed the New York Jets' Eric Mangini and the Pittsburgh Steelers' Mike Tomlin as the youngest head coach since the AFLÿNFL merger in 1970.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 12, 2007, in his NFL head coaching debut, Kiffin and the Raiders won their preseason opener 27ÿ23 over the Arizona Cardinals. Kiffin vehemently opposed the selection of LSU quarterback JaMarcus Russell in the 2007 NFL Draft, who would eventually be regarded as one of the biggest draft busts in NFL history.[11] Russell held out until September 12, and did not make his first start until December 2, long after the season was effectively over. Kiffin recorded his first regular season win as an NFL head coach on September 23, 2007; the Raiders defeated the Cleveland Browns by a score of 26ÿ24 when defensive lineman Tommy Kelly blocked a late Cleveland field goal. At his end-of-the-season press conference, Kiffin told the media and his players that he had many plans and changes he was going to make in the 2008 offseason. When asked by his players about rumors that Kiffin was interested in open coaching positions in college football, he told them he never thought the rumors were important enough to address because he was never planning to leave.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 25, 2008, ESPN NFL analyst Chris Mortensen reported that Davis, who was not known for being patient with his coaches, tried to force Kiffin to resign after his first season ended with a 4ÿ12 record. A source allegedly close to Kiffin told Mortensen that Kiffin would not resign, and would not sign the letter of resignation that would cause him to forfeit his $2 million salary for the remaining guaranteed year of his contract.[13] However, the Raiders denied the story, while Kiffin refused to comment.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 15, 2008, NBC Sports reported Davis was unhappy with Kiffin, and intended to fire him as soon as the following Monday or Tuesday. On September 30, 2008, Davis fired Kiffin over the telephone.[15] At the televised news conference announcing the firing, Davis called Kiffin \\"a flat-out liar\\" and said he was guilty of \\"bringing disgrace to the organization\\". The Raiders said the move was made for cause, meaning they would terminate his contract immediately without paying the $2.6 million that was left on it for 2008. Kiffin later added in an interview with ESPN that he was not proud to be associated with Davis's accusations and was actually more embarrassed for Davis than himself.[16] The Raiders subsequently released a letter Davis sent to Kiffin on September 12 that warned him that he was on the verge of being fired for \\"conduct detrimental to the Raiders,\\" including repeated instances of making excuses and outright lies.[17] Kiffin's post-firing press conference was canceled. Kiffin filed a grievance against the Raiders, claiming that he was fired without cause,[18] but on November 15, 2010, an arbitrator ruled that Davis did indeed have cause to fire Kiffin.[19] Kiffin's short tenure as the Raiders' head coach ended with a 5ÿ15 record. Offensive line coach Tom Cable was given interim head coaching duties for the remainder of the 2008 season and was later made their permanent head coach on February 4, 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of his former Raider staff expressed interest as Kiffin began assembling his new staff at the University of Tennessee. On December 15, 2008, Raiders head coach Tom Cable lashed out at Kiffin for hiring one of his assistants, James Cregg, with two weeks remaining in the NFL season. Cable called the timing of Cregg's departure \\"wrong in the business of coaching\\" and indicated he had lost respect for Kiffin and planned to confront him about it. Nothing further was said publicly regarding the incident.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the animosity between the Raiders and Kiffin, he released a statement following Al Davis's death in October 2011 stating that although their relationship had not ended well, he appreciated the opportunity Davis had given him and had \\"nothing but the greatest respect\\" for the late Raiders owner.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 28, 2008, multiple media outlets reported that Kiffin would be the next head football coach for the University of Tennessee Volunteers in 2009, replacing head coach Phillip Fulmer, who retired.[22][23] Tennessee formally introduced Kiffin as the school's 21st head football coach on December 1, 2008 in a 2:00?p.m. news conference.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of 33, Kiffin was hired by Tennessee and became the youngest active head coach in Division I FBS, surpassing Northwestern's Pat Fitzgerald.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nKiffin signed a memorandum of understanding with the University of Tennessee on November 30, 2008. The deal included $2 million in 2009, with additional performance bonuses, including a $300,000 bonus if Tennessee was to compete for the national championship. His salary was set to increase over the six-year-deal, reaching a high of $2.75 million in 2014. The average salary of the deal was $2.375 million. If Kiffin had been fired in 2009 or 2010, the school would have to pay him $7.5 million under a buyout clause; after the 2012 season, the buyout clause decreased to $5 million.[26] Kiffin's contract stated that if he resigned, he would have to pay UT $1 million in 2009, with the sum decreasing by $200,000 each year of his contract.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nKiffin led the Vols to a 7ÿ6 record in 2009, an improvement from their 5ÿ7 record in 2008. The Vols increased their offensive output by more than 60 percent in 2009 with Kiffin calling the offensive plays.[28] Highlights included wins over South Carolina, Georgia, and Kentucky. However, the season was marred by losses to UCLA, Florida, Auburn, Alabama, and Ole Miss, as well as a 23-point blow-out loss to Virginia Tech in the Chick-fil-A Bowl. After one season as coach, Kiffin left the Vols during the 2010 recruiting season to accept the head coaching job at the University of Southern California after Pete Carroll left to go to the Seattle Seahawks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 5, 2009, during a Tennessee booster breakfast at the Knoxville Convention Center, Kiffin accused Urban Meyer, then head coach of the Florida Gators and currently head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes, of violating NCAA recruiting rules.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I'm going to turn Florida in right here in front of you,\\" Kiffin told the crowd. \\"As Nu'Keese (Richardson) was here on campus, his phone keeps ringing. And so one of our coaches is sitting in the meeting with him and says, 'Who is that?' And he looks at the phone and says, 'Urban Meyer.'  Just so you know, you can't call a recruit on another campus. But I love the fact that Urban had to cheat and still didn't get him.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Kiffin accused Meyer of violating NCAA rules, he incidentally violated a Southeastern Conference rule that prevented coaches from mentioning a recruit by name. Kiffin's accusations against Meyer were mistaken.[29]\\r\\nSoutheastern Conference commissioner Mike Slive issued a public reprimand to Kiffin because of the comment.[30] In addition to the SEC's public reprimand, Florida Athletic Director Jeremy Foley demanded a public apology from Kiffin.[31] Kiffin issued a public apology one day after making the comment. In a statement released by the University of Tennessee, Kiffin wrote, \\"In my enthusiasm for our recruiting class, I made some statements that were meant solely to excite those at the breakfast. If I offended anyone at the University of Florida, including Mr. Foley and Urban Meyer, I sincerely apologize. That was not my intention.\\"[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nKiffin generated further controversy when he told wide receiver recruit Alshon Jeffery that if Jeffery chose the Gamecocks, \\"he would end up pumping gas for the rest of his life like all the other players from that state who had gone to South Carolina.\\" Jeffery went on to sign with the University of South Carolina Gamecocks and became the second round, 45th pick overall in the 2012 NFL Draft being signed by the Chicago Bears, and selected to the 2014 Pro Bowl.[33][34] Kiffin denied making the statement, however the incident was corroborated by Jeffery's high school coach Walter Wilson, who was listening to Kiffin's remarks on speakerphone.[35][36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nKiffin's departure for USC in 2010 after just one season as head coach of the Volunteers upset some students and fans of the University of Tennessee. When Tennessee athletic director Mike Hamilton was asked for an assessment of Kiffin's tenure coaching the Volunteers, he responded with just one word: \\"Brief.\\"[38] Hundreds of students rioted on campus at the news of Kiffin's departure.[39] Knoxville police and fire department were brought in after students blocked the exit from the Neyland Thompson Sports Center and started several small fires.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 12, 2010, Kiffin returned to USC to become the Trojans' head coach. This came following Pete Carroll's departure from USC to become the head coach of the Seattle Seahawks.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2010, after a prolonged four-year investigation into whether former USC running back Reggie Bush and his family had accepted financial benefits and housing from two sports agents in San Diego while he was a student athlete at USC, the NCAA imposed sanctions against the Trojan football program for a \\"lack of institutional control,\\" including a two-year postseason ban, the loss of 30 scholarships over three years, and the vacation of all wins in which Bush participated as an \\"ineligible\\" player, including the 2005 Orange Bowl, in which the Trojans won the BCS National Championship.[42] The severity of these sanctions has been criticized by some NCAA football writers,[43][44][45][46][47] including ESPN's Ted Miller, who wrote, \\"It's become an accepted fact among informed college football observers that the NCAA sanctions against USC were a travesty of justice, and the NCAA's refusal to revisit that travesty are a massive act of cowardice on the part of the organization.\\"[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nKiffin's tenure at USC was widely considered a disappointment. Questionable coaching calls and the restrictions of sanctions contributed to a sense of missed opportunity for Kiffin and the Trojans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, his first season at USC, Kiffin's Trojans team finished the season with an 8ÿ5 record but were ineligible for post-season play due to the NCAA sanctions. After the NCAA issued a guideline allowing current USC juniors and seniors to automatically transfer from USC without having to sit out a year, several USC players left before the start of the 2010 season, including Malik Jackson and Byron Moore to Tennessee, Travon Patterson to Colorado, D.J. Shoemate to Connecticut, Uona Kaveinga to BYU, and Blake Ayles to Miami, among others.[49] Seantrel Henderson, who had signed a letter of intent to USC, was granted a release by Kiffin and immediately enrolled at Miami.  Both Kiffin and former head coach Pete Carroll publicly referred to this NCAA-transfer exception as \\"free agency\\" because it allowed current USC players to be targeted for transfer opportunities and granted them immediate eligibility at their transfer destination.[50] USC played the 2010 season with just 71 scholarship players, some of whom were redshirt candidates who did not play, instead of the normal NCAA allowance of 85 scholarship players.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason highlights included a 48ÿ14 win over the California Golden Bears in which quarterback Matt Barkley tied the USC record for touchdown passes in a game by completing five in just the first half to put the Trojans up 42ÿ0 at halftime.[51] After losing to rival Notre Dame for the first time in eight years, USC bounced back to close their season with a win over cross-town rival UCLA to retain the Victory Bell.  Quarterback Matt Barkley returned after missing the previous week and threw one of the team's two touchdown passes. Allen Bradford led the Trojans by gaining 212 yards rushing and catching a 47-yard touchdown pass.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, Kiffin coached the Trojans to a 10ÿ2 record (7ÿ2 in the Pac-12), despite being ineligible for post-season play for the second consecutive season. On May 26, 2011, the NCAA's Appeals Committee upheld the sanctions against USC, after ruling that the use of precedent was not allowed under NCAA Bylaws, so the USC football team could not participate in the Pac-12 Football Championship Game (although they held the best record in the South division) or play in a bowl game during the 2011ÿ12 season.[53] The BCS announced June 6, 2011, that it had stripped USC of the 2004 title,[54] though USC still retains the 2003 and 2004 AP National Championships.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason highlights included road wins against the California Golden Bears, Notre Dame Fighting Irish, and Oregon Ducks.[55] Kiffin's Trojans lost in triple overtime to the Stanford Cardinal, who were led by quarterback Andrew Luck, but they bounced back by winning their last four games and defeating the UCLA Bruins 50ÿ0 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which extended the Trojans' victory streak against the Bruins to five.\\r\\n\\r\\nUSC ended the season with two thousand-yard receivers (Robert Woods and Marqise Lee), a thousand-yard rusher (Curtis McNeal), and a 3,000-yard passer (Matt Barkley) for the first time since the 2005 season, when Kiffin was the offensive coordinator.\\r\\n\\r\\nKiffin for the first time became a voting member of the USA Today Coaches' Poll, but he resigned after just one vote amidst controversy over his preseason selection of USC as No. 1. After being informed that Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez had voted the Trojans as the top team, Kiffin told reporters, \\"I would not vote USC No. 1, I can tell you that much.\\" However, USA Today, citing the need to \\"protect the poll's integrity\\", revealed that Kiffin had voted his team for the top spot. Kiffin apologized and explained that his comments were from the perspective of an opposing coach voting for USC.[56]\\r\\nThe Trojans finished the season with a 7ÿ6 record overall and a 5ÿ4 record in Pac-12 conference play. The Trojans were ranked #1 in both major polls at the start of the season, but a lackluster season (including a .500 record in conference play) left them unranked by the end of the season. Prior to 2012, the last time a team that was the pre-season ranked #1 finished the season unranked was USC in 1963.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Trojans lost their first two conference games of the 2013 season against Washington State and Arizona State, making Kiffin's record 4ÿ7 in his last eleven games. On September 28, 2013, after the 62ÿ41 loss to Arizona State, USC Athletics Director Pat Haden fired Kiffin hours after the game, when the team arrived back in Los Angeles at 3 a.m. Kiffin was called off the team bus that was preparing to head back to campus from Los Angeles International Airport and taken to a small room inside the terminal where Haden told Kiffin he was being dismissed. Haden supposedly met with USC president Max Nikias in the third quarter and they decided Kiffin should be terminated. Haden formally announced the decision to dismiss Kiffin the next day.[58] Assistant coach Ed Orgeron took over for Kiffin and led the team to a 6ÿ2 finish, including an upset win against Stanford at the Coliseum. USC won the 2013 Las Vegas Bowl under interim head coach Clay Helton against Fresno State. Former USC associate head coach and Washington head coach Steve Sarkisian was hired by Haden following the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2013, Kiffin spent eight days in Tuscaloosa, Alabama reviewing the Alabama Crimson Tide football team's offense.[59] On January 9, 2014, after Michigan hired Alabama offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier, Kiffin interviewed for the vacant coordinator job. Kiffin was offered the job as offensive coordinator at Alabama and accepted on January 10.[59][60] In 2014, Kiffin was a finalist for the Broyles Award, given annually to the nation's top college football assistant coach.[61] On January 2, 2017, Kiffin was relieved of his duties as Offensive Coordinator.[62] He was replaced by another former USC head coach and his successor at that job, Steve Sarkisian, for the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship 35ÿ31 loss against Clemson and for the upcoming season.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 12, 2016, Kiffin accepted the head coaching position at Florida Atlantic University.[3] After a 1-3 start, the FAU Owl reeled off ten straight wins, culminating in the Conference USA football championship against University of North Texas, 41-17, on their home field. FAU was slated to play the University of Akron in the Boca Raton Bowl on December 19, 2017. On December 19, 2017, before the game against Akron it was announced on ESPN that Kiffin and FAU had agreed to a new deal that would keep him on for the next ten years through the 2027 season. John Kelly, the President of FAU was quoted in the article as saying, \\"This is further proof of FAU's unbridled ambition . . . I thought we could be a Top-25 program and we need a coach who can do that, he's on the verge of doing that. We're obviously looking toward keeping Lane long term.\\" [64] In his first year with FAU, Kiffin led the Owls to an 11-3 season after a 50-3 victory over Akron in the Boca Raton Bowl on December 19, 2017. The 11-3 season was the first season over .500 for the FAU Owls since 2008, and the first time they have achieved over ten wins while competing at the Division 1 Football level. The 2017 FAU Football Season is only the 4th time in school history they had a winning record in Division 1 Football.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nLane is the son of Monte Kiffin, a long time defensive coordinator in the National Football League, most notably for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Monte resigned as the defensive coordinator on Lane's staff at USC and was hired for the same position with the Dallas Cowboys.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nLane and his ex-wife Layla, who is a University of Florida alumna, have three children, daughters Landry and Pressley and son, Monte Knox Kiffin.[66] Kiffin's brother, Chris, was a defensive lineman at Colorado State University and is the current defensive coordinator for FAU.[67] Kiffin's former father-in-law, John Reaves, was a former starting NFL and USFL quarterback who played college football for the Florida Gators. On February 28, 2016, Lane and Layla announced that they were separating and had mutually decided to divorce.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\n ?

The New England colonies were part of the Thirteen Colonies and eventually became five of the six states in New England.[1] Captain John Smith's 1616 work A Description of New England first applied the term \\"New England\\"[2] to the coastal lands from Long Island Sound to Newfoundland.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance, England, and other countries made several attempts to colonize New England early in the 17th century, and those nations were often in contention for lands in the New World. French nobleman Pierre Dugua Sieur de Monts established a settlement on Saint Croix Island, Maine in June 1604 under the authority of the King of France. Nearly half the settlers perished due to the harsh winter and scurvy, and the survivors moved north out of New England to Port-Royal of Nova Scotia (see symbol \\"R\\" on map to the right) in the spring of 1605.[4]\\r\\nKing James I of England recognized the need for a permanent settlement in New England, and he granted competing royal charters to the Plymouth Company and the London Company. The Plymouth Company ships arrived at the mouth of the Kennebec River (then called the Sagadahoc River) in August 1607 where they established a settlement named Sagadahoc Colony, better known as Popham Colony (see symbol \\"Po\\" on map to right) to honor financial backer Sir John Popham. The colonists faced a harsh winter, the loss of supplies following a storehouse fire, and mixed relations with the local Indian tribes.\\r\\nColony leader Captain George Popham died, and Raleigh Gilbert decided to return to England to take up an inheritance left by the death of an older brotherat which point, all of the colonists decided to return to England. It was around August 1608 when they left on the ship Mary and John and on a new ship built by the colony named Virginia of Sagadahoc. The 30-ton Virginia was the first sea-going ship ever built in North America.[5]\\r\\nConflict over land rights continued through the early 17th century, with the French constructing Fort Pentagouet near Castine, Maine in 1613. The fort protected a trading post and a fishing station and was the first longer-term settlement in New England. It changed hands multiple times throughout the 17th century among the English, French, and Dutch colonists.[6]\\r\\nIn 1614, Dutch explorer Adriaen Block traveled along the coast of Long Island Sound and then up the Connecticut River to Hartford, Connecticut. By 1623, the Dutch West India Company regularly traded for furs there, and they eventually fortified it for protection from the Pequot Indians and named the site \\"House of Hope\\" (also identified as \\"Fort Hoop,\\" \\"Good Hope,\\" and \\"Hope\\").[7]\\r\\nA group of Puritans known as the Pilgrims arrived on the Mayflower from England and the Netherlands to establish Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts, the second successful English colony in North America following Jamestown, Virginia. About half of the one hundred-plus passengers on the Mayflower died that first winter, mostly because of diseases contracted on the voyage followed by a harsh winter.[8] In 1621, an American Indian named Squanto taught the colonists how to grow corn and where to catch eels and fish. His assistance was invaluable and helped them to survive the early years of the colonization. The Pilgrims lived on the same site where Squanto's Patuxet tribe had established a village before they were wiped out from diseases.[9]\\r\\nThe Plymouth settlement faced great hardships and earned few profits, but it enjoyed a positive reputation in England and may have sown the seeds for further immigration. Edward Winslow and William Bradford published an account of their experiences called Mourt's Relation (1622).[10] This book was only a small glimpse of the hardships and dangers encountered by the Pilgrims, but it encouraged other Puritans to immigrate during the Great Migration.\\r\\nThe Puritans in England first sent smaller groups in the mid-1620s to establish colonies, buildings, and food supplies, learning from the Pilgrims' harsh experiences of winter in the Plymouth Colony. In 1623, the Plymouth Council for New England (successor to the Plymouth Company) established a small fishing village at Cape Ann under the supervision of the Dorchester Company. The first group of Puritans moved to a new town at nearby Naumkeag after the Dorchester Company dropped support, and fresh financial support was found by Rev. John White. Other settlements were started in nearby areas; however, the overall Puritan population remained small through the 1620s.[11]\\r\\nA larger group of Puritans arrived in 1630, leaving England because they desired to worship in a manner that differed from the Church of England. Their views were in accord with those of the Pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower, except that the Pilgrims were \\"separatists\\" who felt that they needed to separate themselves from the Church of England, whereas the later Puritans were content to remain under the umbrella of the Church of England. The separate colonies were governed independently of one other until 1691, when Plymouth Colony was absorbed into the Massachusetts Bay Colony to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay.\\r\\nEarly dissenters of the Puritan laws were often banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Connecticut Colony was started after Puritan minister Thomas Hooker left Massachusetts Bay with about 100 followers in search of greater religious and political freedom. John Wheelwright left with his followers to a colony in New Hampshire and then on to Maine. The Puritans also established the American public school system for the express purpose of ensuring that future generations would be able to read the Bible for themselves, which was a central tenet of Puritan worship.[12]\\r\\nIt was the dead of winter in January 1636 when minister Roger Williams was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony because of theological differences. One source of contention was his view that government and religion should be separate; he also believed that the colonies should purchase land at fair prices from the Wampanoag and Narragansett tribes. He escaped being deported to England by the Massachusetts officials and walked from Salem, Massachusetts to Raynham, Massachusetts, a distance of 55 miles through the deep snow. The Indian tribes helped him to survive and sold him land for a new colony which he named Providence Plantations in recognition of the intervention of Divine Providence in establishing the new colony. It was unique in its day in expressly providing for religious freedom and a separation of church from state. Other dissenters established two settlements on Rhode Island (now called Aquidneck Island) and another settlement in Warwick; these four settlements eventually united to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.[13]\\r\\nThomas Hooker left Massachusetts in 1636 with 100 followers and founded a settlement just north of the Dutch Fort Hoop which grew into Connecticut Colony. The community was first named Newtown then renamed Hartford to honor the English town of Hertford. One of the reasons why Hooker left was that only members of the church could vote and participate in the government in Massachusetts Bay, which he believed should include any adult male owning property. The Connecticut Colony was not the first settlement in Connecticut (the Dutch were first) or even the first English settlement (Windsor was first in 1633). Thomas Hooker obtained a royal charter and established Fundamental Orders, considered to be one of the first constitutions in North America. Other colonies later merged into the royal charter for the Connecticut Colony, including New Haven and Saybrook.\\r\\nThe earliest colonies in New England were usually fishing villages or farming communities on the more fertile land along the rivers. The rocky soil in the New England Colonies was not as fertile as the Middle or Southern Colonies, but the land provided rich resources, including lumber that was valued for building homes and ships. Lumber was also a resource that could be exported back to England, where there was a shortage of wood. In addition, the hunting of wildlife provided furs to be traded and food for the table.\\r\\nThe New England Colonies were located along the Atlantic coast where there was an abundance of marketable sea life. Excellent harbors and some inland waterways offered protection for ships and were also valuable for fresh water fishing. By the end of the 17th century, New England colonists had created an Atlantic trade network that connected them to the English homeland as well as to the West African slave coast, the Caribbean's plantation islands, and the Iberian Peninsula. Colonists relied upon British and European imports for glass, linens, hardware, machinery, and other items for the household.\\r\\nThe Southern Colonies could produce tobacco, rice, and indigo in exchange for imports, whereas New England's colonies could not offer much to England beyond fish, furs, and lumber. Inflation was a major issue in the economy. During the 18th century, shipbuilding drew upon the abundant lumber and revived the economy, often under the direction of the British Crown.[14]\\r\\nEnslavement of enemies defeated in war was a common practice in European nations at this time. This was a policy that had been going on for decades in Ireland, particularly since the time of Elizabeth I and during the mid-17th century Cromwell wars in Britain and Ireland, where large numbers of Irish, Welsh, and Scots prisoners of war were sent as slaves to plantations in the West Indies, especially to Barbados and Jamaica.[15] The practice found its way to the American colonies during the Pequot War and King Philip's War.\\r\\nMilitary leader Benjamin Church spoke out against enslaving Indians in the summer of 1675, describing the practice as \\"an action so hateful that (I) opposed it to the loss of the good will and respect of some that before were (my) good friends.\\" This said, Church was an owner of African slaves himself, like many Englishmen in the colony.[16] Ships carrying captured war combatants began to leave New England ports during King Philip's War (1675-78) and continued for the three years of the war. The policy concerning war enemies was that \\"no male captive above the age of fourteen years should reside in the colony.\\"[17] It is estimated that at least a thousand New England Indian warriors were sold as slaves during King Philip's War, with over half of those coming from Plymouth.[18]\\r\\nIn the New England Colonies, the first settlements of Pilgrims and the other Puritans who came later taught their children how to read and write in order that they might read and study the Bible for themselves. Depending upon social and financial status, education was taught by the parents home-schooling their children, public grammar schools, and private governesses, which included subjects from reading and writing to Latin and Greek and more.","input":"What are the colonies in the new england colonies?"},{"output":"Thomas Joseph Thibodeau Jr.","context":"As head coach:\\r\\nAs assistant coach:\\r\\nThomas Joseph Thibodeau Jr. (/?Ĳ?b?do?/ THIB-?-doh;[1][2] born January 17, 1958) is an American basketball coach who is head coach and president of basketball operations of the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA).[3] Since June 2013, he has served as an assistant coach for the USA Basketball Men's National Team.\\r\\nAs a defensive coach, he helped the Houston Rockets rank among the Top 5 in the league in scoring defense and field goal percentage defense from 2004 to 2007,[4] and he has helped his team finish in the league's Top 10 in team defense 15 times.[5] He coached in 87 playoff games and was part of the 1999 NBA Finals as an assistant coach with the New York Knicks before joining the Boston Celtics, with whom he won the 2008 NBA Championship, serving as a defensive coach.

Thibodeau was named the NBA Coach of the Year on May 1, 2011, after tying the record for most wins by a rookie head coach with 62. He also led the Bulls to their first 50-win season and first division title since the Michael Jordan era.[18] The Bulls lost the Eastern Conference Finals to the Miami Heat.\\r\\nOn February 14, 2012, Thibodeau clinched the position of Eastern Conference All-Star Coach for the All-Star Game in Orlando. At the time, the Bulls were first in the Eastern Conference.[citation needed]\\r\\nWith a win over the Orlando Magic on March 19, 2012, Thibodeau became the fastest coach in NBA history to earn 100 career victories. He accomplished this in 130 games, one game fewer than the record set previously by Avery Johnson in 2006.[19] Thibodeau and the Bulls were the East's top seed entering the playoffs and also had the league's best regular-season record and home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.[20]\\r\\nIn Game 1 of the Bulls' first-round series against the Philadelphia 76ers, point guard Derrick Rose tore his ACL.[21] Thibodeau defended his decision to keep Rose in the game with 1 minute, 22 seconds remaining in the game and the Bulls leading by 12 points.[22] Commenting on Thibodeau's decision, Bulls general manager Gar Forman stated, \\"There is absolutely no issue there.

The war, which began primarily over the control of Northeastern India, ended in a decisive British victory, giving the British total control of Assam, Manipur, Cachar and Jaintia as well as Arakan Province and Tenasserim. The Burmese were also forced to pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling, and sign a commercial treaty.[1][2]\\r\\nFifteen thousand European and Indian soldiers died, together with an unknown number of Burmese military and civilian casualties. The high cost of the campaign to the British, 5ÿ13?million pounds sterling (S386?million-S1?billion as of 2016),[3][4] contributed to a severe economic crisis in British India which cost the East India Company its remaining privileges.[5]\\r\\nFor the Burmese Empire, it was the beginning of the end of their independence. The Third Burmese Empire, for a brief time the terror of British India, was crippled and no longer a threat to the eastern frontier of British India.[4] The Burmese would be crushed for years to come by repaying the large indemnity of one million pounds (then US$5 million), a large sum at that time.[2] The British would wage two more wars against a much-weakened Burma, and swallow up the entire country by 1885.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1822, Burmese expansion into Manipur and Assam had created a long border between British India and the Burmese Empire. The British, based in Calcutta, supported rebels from Manipur, Assam and Arakan fleeing into British territory. Calcutta unilaterally declared Cachar and Jaintia British protectorates, and sent in troops.[6] Cross border raids into these newly acquired territories from British territories and spheres of influence vexed the Burmese. Convinced that war was inevitable, Burmese commander-in-chief, Maha Bandula, became a main proponent of offensive policy against the British. Bandula was part of the war party at Bagyidaw's court, which also included Queen Me Nu and her brother, the Lord of Salin.[4] Bandula believed that a decisive victory could allow Ava to consolidate its gains in its new western empire in Arakan, Manipur, Assam, Cachar and Jaintia, as well as take over eastern Bengal.[6]\\r\\nIn September 1823, the casus belli was Burma occupying Shalpuri Island near Chittagong, which was claimed by the East India Company.[7]\\r\\nIn January 1824, Burma sent one of their top generals, Thado Thiri Maha Uzana, into Cachar and Jaintia to disperse the rebels. The British sent in their own force to meet the Burmese in Cachar, resulting in the first clashes between the two. The war formally broke out on 5 March 1824, following border clashes in Arakan.\\r\\nThe British reason for the war was, in addition to expanding British Bengal's sphere of influence, the desire for new markets for British manufacturing.[8][9] The British were also anxious to deny the French the use of Burmese harbours and concerned about French influence at the Court of Ava, as the kingdom was still known to them.[10] British Ambassador Michael Symes's mission was equipped to gain as much knowledge as possible of the country for future British plans whereas previous envoys were concerned principally with trade concessions. AngloÿFrench rivalry had already played a role during Alaungpaya's endeavours of unifying the kingdom.[10] The Burmese in these wars were advancing into smaller states not ruled by the British or the subject of expansionary goals by the British before the war began, and the British were not so much preoccupied by the refugee problem initially as by the threat posed by the French until further incidents forced their hand.[10]\\r\\nThe commander in chief of the Burmese army, Maha Bandula, was supported by twelve of the country's best divisions, including one under his personal command, all totaling 10,000 men and 500 horses. His general staff included some of the country's most decorated soldiers, men like the Lord of Salay and the governors of Danyawaddy, Wuntho and Taungoo. Bandula's plan was to attack the British on two fronts: Chittagong from Arakan in the southeast, and Sylhet from Cachar and Jaintia in the north.[6] Bandula personally commanded the Arakan theatre while Uzana commanded Cachar and Jaintia theater.[4]\\r\\nEarly in the war, battle hardened Burmese forces were able to push back the British forces because the Burmese, who had been fighting in the jungles of Manipur and Assam for nearly a decade, were more familiar with the terrain which represented \\"a formidable obstacle to the march of a European force\\".[1] Uzana had already defeated the British units in Cachar and Jaintia in January 1824. In May, Burmese forces led by U Sa, Lord Myawaddy (about 4,000)[11] fought their way into Bengal, and defeated British troops at the Battle of Ramu, 10 miles east of Cox's Bazar on 17 May 1824.[12] Sa's column then joined Bandula's column on the march to defeat British forces at Gadawpalin, and went on to capture Cox's Bazar.[13] The Burmese success caused extreme panic in Chittagong and in Calcutta.[14] Across the eastern Bengal, the European inhabitants formed themselves into militia forces. And a large portion of the crews of the East India Company's ships were landed to assist in the defence of Calcutta.[15]\\r\\nBut Bandula, not wanting to overstretch, stopped U Sa from proceeding to Chittagong. Had Bandula marched on to Chittagong, which unbeknown to him was lightly held, he could have taken it and the way to Calcutta would have been open. Had they been able to threaten Calcutta, the Burmese could have obtained more favourable terms in the peace negotiations later on.[2]\\r\\nInstead of fighting in hard terrain, the British took the fight to the Burmese mainland. On 11 May 1824, a British naval force of over 10,000 men (5,000 British soldiers and over 5,000 Indian sepoys) entered the harbour of Yangon, taking the Burmese by surprise.[16][17] The Burmese, pursuing a scorched earth policy, left an empty city behind and chose to fortify positions along an east-west 10-mile arc outside the city. The British forces led by General Archibald Campbell took position inside the Shwedagon Pagoda compound, which was fortified. The British launched attacks on Burmese lines, and by July 1824, had successfully pushed the Burmese towards Kamayut, five miles from Shwedagon. Burmese efforts to retake Shwedagon in September failed.[18]\\r\\nKing Bagyidaw ordered a near complete withdrawal from the western frontBandula from Arakan and Bengal, and Uzana from Assam, Cachar and Jaintiaand meet the enemy in Yangon. In August, in the midst of monsoon season, Bandula and his army crossed the Arakan Yoma.[19] Moving tens of thousands of men over the 3,000-foot-high Arakan hills, or 10,000-foot-high Assamese ranges, heavily forested with only narrow footpaths and open to attack by tigers and leopards, would be difficult even in mild weather conditions. To do this at the height of the drenching monsoon season was a particularly difficult task. Yet Bandula (from Arakan) and Uzana (from Assam) in a testament to their generalship and logistical skills, managed to do just that. The King granted both Bandula and Uzana the title Agga Maha Thenapati, the highest possible military rank. Bandula was also made the governor of Sittaung.[18]\\r\\nBy November, Bandula commanded a force of 30,000 massed outside Yangon. Bandula believed that he could take on a well-armed British force of 10,000 head-on. Although the Burmese were numerically superior, only 15,000 of the 30,000 had muskets. The Burmese cannons fired only balls whereas the British cannons fired exploding shells.[16] Unbeknown to him, the British had just received the first shipment of the newest weapon in war that the Burmese had never seenCongreve rockets.[19][20] More ominous for the Burmese, the speedy march through the hilly regions of Rakhine Yoma and Assamese ranges had left their troops exhausted.\\r\\nOn 30 November, in what turned out be the biggest mistake of his career, Bandula ordered a frontal attack on British positions. The British, with far superior weaponry, withstood several Burmese charges at the Shwedagon fort, cutting down men by the thousands. By 7 December, the British troops, supported by rocket fire, had begun to gain the upper hand. On 15 December, the Burmese were driven out of their last remaining stronghold at Kokine.[20] In the end, only 7,000 of the 30,000 Burmese soldiers returned.[16]\\r\\nBandula fell back to his rear base at Danubyu, a small town not far from Yangon, in the Irrawaddy delta. Having lost experienced men in Yangon, the Burmese forces now numbered about 10,000, of mixed quality, including some of the king's best soldiers but also many untrained and barely armed conscripts. The stockade itself stretched a mile along the riverbank, and was made up of solid teak beams no less than 15 feet high.[20]\\r\\nIn March 1825, a four thousand strong British force supported by a flotilla of gun boats attacked Danubyu. The first British attack failed, and Bandula attempted a counter charge, with foot soldiers, cavalry and 17 fighting elephants. But the elephants were stopped by rocket fire and the cavalry found it impossible to move against the sustained British artillery fire.[20]\\r\\nOn 1 April, the British launched a major attack, pounding down on the town with their heavy guns and raining their rockets on every part of the Burmese line. Bandula was killed by a mortar shell. Bandula had walked around the fort to boost the morale of his men, in his full insignia under a glittering golden umbrella, discarding the warnings of his generals that he would prove an easy target for the enemy's guns. After Bandula's death, the Burmese evacuated Danubyu.[20]\\r\\nU Sa was left to command the remaining Burmese troops in Arakan after Bandula and the main battalions were ordered to withdraw from Arakan by Bagyidaw to meet the British invasion in Yangon in August 1824. Sa held on to Arakan throughout 1824 while the main focal point of the war played out in Yangon. After Gen. Archibald Campbell finally defeated Gen. Bandula in the Battle of Yangon in December 1824, the British turned their sights to Arakan. On 1 February 1825, an invasion force of 11,000 soldiers supported by a flotilla of gun boats and armed cruisers along the coast and a squadron of cavalry under the command of Gen. Morrison attacked Burmese positions in Arakan. Despite their superior numbers and firearms, the British had to fight depleted Burmese forces for nearly two months before they reached the main Burmese garrison at Mrauk-U, Arakan's capital. On 29 March 1825, the British launched their attack on Mrauk-U. (At the same time, Campbell also launched an attack on Bandula's positions in the Battle of Danubyu.) After a few days of fighting, the Burmese at Mrauk-U were defeated on April 1, coincidentally the same day Maha Bandula fell at Danubyu. Sa and the remaining Burmese forces evacuated and left Arakan. The British proceeded to occupy the rest of Arakan.[11]\\r\\nOn 17 September 1825, an armistice was concluded for one month. In the course of the summer, General Joseph Wanton Morrison had conquered the province of Arakan; in the north, the Burmese were expelled from Assam; and the British had made some progress in Cachar, though their advance was finally impeded by the thick forests and jungle.\\r\\nPeace negotiations that began in September broke down by early October after the Burmese would not agree to British terms. The British had demanded no less than the complete dismemberment of the Burmese western territories in Arakan, Assam, Manipur and the Tenasserim coast as well as two million pounds sterling of indemnity. The Burmese would not agree to give up Arakan and the large sum of indemnity.[21]\\r\\nIn November 1825, the Burmese decided to throw everything they had into last-ditch effort. Starting in mid-November, the Burmese forces, consisting mainly of Shan regiments led by their sawbwas, threatened Prome in a daring circular movement that almost surrounded the town and cut off communications lines to Yangon. In the end, the superior firepower of the British guns and missiles won out.[21] On 1 December, Gen. Campbell, with 2500 European and 1500 Indian sepoys, supported by a flotilla of gun boats, attacked the main Burmese position outside Prome. On 2 December, Maha Ne Myo was killed by a shell launched from the flotilla. After Maha Ne Myo's death, the British dislodged the Burmese by 5 December.[22]\\r\\nThe defeat in Prome effectively left the Burmese army in disarray. The Burmese army was in constant retreat from then on. On 26 December, they sent a flag of truce to the British camp. Negotiations having commenced, the Burmese were forced to accept the British terms to end the war, signing the Treaty of Yandabo in February 1826..\\r\\nThe British demanded and the Burmese agreed to:[1][2]\\r\\nThe first installment of indemnity was to be paid immediately, the second installment within the first 100 days from signing of the treaty, and the rest within two years. Until the second installment was paid, the British would not leave Yangon.[2]\\r\\nThe Treaty of Yandabo was signed by General Campbell from the British side and Governor of Legaing Maha Min Hla Kyaw Htin from the Burmese side on 24 February 1826.[23] The Burmese paid 250,000 pounds sterling in gold and silver bullion as the first installment of the indemnity, and also released British prisoners of war. The war was thus brought to an end, and the British army moved south. The British army remained in the territories surrendered to it under the treaty and in the territories such as the Rangoon area which were occupied for several years in guarantee of the financial terms of the treaty.\\r\\nThe treaty imposed a severe financial burden to the Burmese Kingdom, and effectively left it crippled. The British terms in the negotiations were strongly influenced by the heavy cost in lives and money which the war had entailed. Some 40,000 British and Indians troops had been involved of whom 15,000 had been killed. The cost to the British India's finances had been almost ruinous, amounting to approximately 13 million pounds sterling. The cost of war contributed to a severe economic crisis in India, which by 1833 had bankrupted the Bengal agency houses and cost the British East India Company its remaining privileges, including the monopoly of trade to China.[5]\\r\\nFor the Burmese, the treaty was a total humiliation and a long-lasting financial burden. A whole generation of men had been wiped out in battle. The world the Burmese knew, of conquest and martial pride, built on the back of impressive military success of the previous 75 years, had come crashing down.[24] The Court of Ava could not come to terms with the loss of the territories, and made unsuccessful attempts to get them back. An uninvited British resident in Ava was a daily reminder of the humiliating defeat.[5]\\r\\nIn addition, the burden of indemnity left the Burmese royal treasury bankrupt for years. The indemnity of one million pounds sterling was considered a large sum in Europe at that time. It appeared more daunting when converted to the Burmese kyat equivalent of 10 million. The cost of living of the average villager in Upper Burma in 1826 was one kyat per month.[2]\\r\\nThe British would wage two more less expensive wars against the weaker Burmese in 1852 and 1885, and annex Burma by 1885.","input":"When did the first ango burmise war take place?"},{"output":"still-water sources","context":"The Australian green tree frog, simply green tree frog in Australia, White's tree frog, or dumpy tree frog (Litoria caerulea) is a species of tree frog native to Australia and New Guinea, with introduced populations in the United States and New Zealand, though the latter is believed to have died out. The species belongs to the genus Litoria. It is morphologically similar to some other members of the genus, particularly the magnificent tree frog (L.?splendida) and the white-lipped tree frog (L.?infrafrenata).\\r\\nLarger than most Australian frogs, the Australian green tree frog reaches 10?cm (4?in) or more in length. Its average lifespan in captivity, about 16 years, is long compared with most frogs. Docile and well suited to living near human dwellings, Australian green tree frogs are often found on window sills or inside houses, eating insects drawn by the light. The green tree frog screams when it is in danger to scare off its foe, and squeaks when it is touched.\\r\\nDue to its appearance and behavioral traits, the green tree frog is a popular exotic pet throughout the world. The skin secretions of the frog have antibacterial and antiviral properties that may prove useful in pharmaceutical preparations and which have rendered it relatively immune to the population declines being experienced by many species of amphibian. It is a common species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being \\"least concern\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian green tree frog is a member of the tree frog family Hylidae and is placed in the subfamily \\"Pelodryadinae\\" which is endemic to Australia and New Guinea and includes about 160 species in the genera Cyclorana, Litoria and Nyctimystes.[4] Frogs in the genus Litoria are distinguishable from other tree frogs by the presence of horizontal irises and the lack of pigmentation on the eyelids.[5] The common name of the species, \\"White's tree frog\\", is in honor of John White's first description in 1790.[6][7] The green tree frog was the first Australian frog to be scientifically described; the original specimen found its way into the collection of Sir Joseph Banks, but was destroyed when the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London was bombed in World War II.[8]\\r\\nThe species was originally called the \\"blue frog\\" (Rana caerulea) despite its green color. The specimens White sent to England were damaged by the preservative and appeared blue.[6] The color of the frog is caused by blue and green pigments covered in a yellow layer; the preservative destroyed the yellow layer and left the frog with a blue appearance. The specific epithet, caerulea, which is Latin for blue, has remained.[9] This frog is sometimes referred to as Pelodryas caerulea in the scientific literature.[9] In Australia, the frog is also known more simply as the \\"green tree frog\\", but that name is often given to the most common green arboreal species in a region, such as the American green tree frog (Hyla cinerea).\\r\\nThe green tree frog is a plump, rather large tree frog, and can grow up to 11.5?cm (4.5?in) in length, with fully grown females being slightly larger than males. A distinctive fatty ridge is seen over the eye, and the parotoid gland is moderately large. The iris is golden and has a horizontally slit pupil, as is typical of the genus Litoria, and the tympanum (a skin membrane similar to an eardrum) is visible just behind the eye. The limbs are short and robust, and large adhesive discs are at the end of the digits which provide grip while climbing. The fingers are about one-third webbed, and the toes nearly three-quarters webbed. The dorsal color depends on the temperature and nature of the environment, ranging from brownish- or greyish-green to bright emerald green. The frog occasionally has small, irregularly shaped white spots on its back. Males have a greyish, wrinkled vocal sac under the throat, while the throat of females is white. The ventral surface in both sexes is creamy-white and rough in texture.[6][10]\\r\\nThis frog is similar in appearance to the magnificent tree frog (L.?splendida), which inhabits only north-western Australia. Older members of that species have very large parotoid glands, which cover the entire top of their heads and droop over their tympana. The parotoid gland of the green tree frog is much smaller, and it also lacks the yellow speckling on the back and the yellow markings on the hand, groin, and thigh.[11] It can be distinguished from the white-lipped tree frog(giant tree frog L.?infrafrenata) by the distinct white stripe that species has along the edge of the lower jaw and extending to the shoulder, which is not present in the green tree frog.[12]\\r\\nThe tadpoles' appearance changes throughout their development. When newly hatched, they are 8?mm (0.3?in) long and when fully developed, 44?mm (1.7?in). They are initially mottled with brown, and increase in pigmentation (to either green or brown) during development. Their undersides are initially dark, but later become lighter in hue. The eggs are brown and are wrapped in a clear jelly; they are 1.1 to 1.4?mm (0.043 to 0.055?in) in diameter.[9]\\r\\nThe call is a low, slow brawk-brawk-brawk, repeated many times. For most of the year, the frogs call from high positions, such as trees and gutters, but during the breeding season, they descend to near the ponds and pools, where they breed. Like many frogs, green tree frogs call not only to attract a mate, but also to advertise their location outside the mating season. They are particularly vocal after rain, but the reasons for this are unclear. They emit a stress call when they are in danger, such as when being attacked by a predator or when a person steps on the log in which one is concealed.[10]\\r\\nThe green tree frog is native to northern and eastern regions of Australia and to the lowlands of New Guinea. Distribution is limited mostly to areas with warm, wet tropical climates. Its range spans from Irian Jaya to Port Moresby, and is most abundant on Daru Island. The IUCN suggests \\"scattered locations\\" in both New Guinea and Indonesia.[1] In Australia, its range extends from the Kimberley region of Western Australia through the Northern Territory and Queensland to north and central New South Wales and the extreme northeasterly part of South Australia. Its total extent of land occupancy is around 4,078,600 square kilometres (1,574,800?sq?mi).[13]\\r\\nThe species has been introduced to both the United States and New Zealand. In the United States, it is restricted to two regions within Florida, where it was possibly introduced through the pet trade. Only small populations have been found there, and whether they have caused any ecological damage as an invasive species is unknown.[14] In New Zealand, a several individuals were liberated in various locations in 1897 and 1899, and a further accidental introduction was made in the 1940s. No sightings have been reported of this species since the 1950s.[15]\\r\\nDepending on their location, green tree frogs occupy various habitats, but are not usually found in tropical rainforests.[10] They are often found in the canopy of trees near water bodies, but also occupy terrestrial habitats well away from water. They favor old stands of Eucalyptus, where the trees have hollows in which water collects. They are common along inland waterways and can survive in swamps (among the reeds) or in grasslands in cooler climates.[16]\\r\\nGreen tree frogs are little troubled by the presence of humans and often live in close association with them. They sometimes stray inside houses and are found in such places as sinks and toilets. They can also be found on outside windowsills at night, eating insects attracted to the light, and they may gather under outdoor lighting for the same reason.[6][16] They sometimes occupy tanks (cisterns), downpipes (downspouts), and gutters, as these have high humidity and are usually cooler than the external environment. They may be drawn to the downpipes and tanks during the mating season because the fixtures amplify their calls.[10] Green tree frogs seem to have homing abilities, being able to return to locations from which they were caught from a considerable distance after being displaced.[8]\\r\\nGreen tree frogs are very docile and unafraid of humans.[10] They are nocturnal[6] and come out in early evenings to call (in spring and summer) and hunt for food. During the day, they find cool, dark, and moist areas, such as tree holes or rock crevices, in which to sleep. They are not a rainforest species, but make use of the rain that falls almost daily and collects on leaves and in crevices, to keep themselves moist. Their skin exudes a waxy coating that helps prevent evaporation. In dry periods, they avoid desiccation by concealing themselves in a cool spot, perhaps by burrowing, and enveloping themselves in a cocoon made of shed skin and mucus.[10]\\r\\nThe diet of the green tree frog consists mainly of insects such as moths, cockroaches, and locusts. They also eat spiders and can include smaller frogs and even small mammals (including bats[17]) among their prey.[9][10] Frog teeth are not suited to cutting up prey, so the food item must be small enough to fit inside its mouth. Many frogs flick out their sticky tongues at prey and the victim sticks to the tip and is drawn back into the mouth and consumed. A green tree frog uses this technique for smaller prey; for larger items, however, it pounces, then pushes the prey into its mouth with its hands.[8]\\r\\nThe frog has a few native predators, among them snakes and birds. Since the European settlement of Australia, non-native predators have been introduced, primarily dogs and cats.[18] The species has an average life expectancy in captivity of 16 years, but some have been known to live over 20 years.[10]\\r\\nBreeding occurs between November and February.[13] During the mating season, the males call from slightly elevated positions close to the still-water sources in which they choose to breed.[10] Clumps of between 200 and 2000 eggs are laid which initially float, but sink within 24 hours. The development of the tadpoles takes about six weeks, after which they undergo metamorphosis and leave the water as juvenile frogs.[13]\\r\\nThe green tree frog is one of the most popular pet frogs throughout the world. Its docile nature and long life expectancy make it an attractive choice for exotic pet owners. It is also one of the easier frogs to maintain; its diet is broad and it has a strong resistance to disease. One problem commonly associated with keeping this species as a pet is overfeeding; green tree frogs tend to become obese if overfed. In the wild, exertion of energy is required for a frog to capture its prey. However, in captivity, they are usually given live feed in a confined space. This lessens the activity needed for feeding, resulting in weight gain. An overweight member of the species deposits fat layers over the top of the head and body, giving it a \\"dumpy\\" appearance, thus the name \\"dumpy tree frog\\".[10][19]\\r\\nThe rover fireflies of the genus Photinus are poisonous, and an incident has been reported in which a firefly was fed to a green tree frog, which subsequently died.[3]\\r\\nAustralian law gives protected status to the green tree frogalong with all Australian faunaunder the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.[20] The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the green tree frog's conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\", given its broad range, its large total population, and its tolerance of a variety of habitat types. The population trend seems to be stable, and any decline in numbers is not likely to be at a fast enough rate to justify listing it in a more threatened category.[1]\\r\\nIn suburban areas, this frog is threatened by pollution and by predation by domestic animals. Also, some of the frogs have been found to be infected with the chytrid fungus which causes the fatal amphibian disease chytridiomycosis. The frog's status in New Guinea is poorly studied, but in 2002, some 75,000 individuals were exported from Indonesia as part of the pet trade, and this may impact populations in some locations. The frog is present in a number of protected areas in New Guinea, and it has been successfully bred in some Australian zoos. Overall, the main threat to this species is the potential for a widespread disease epidemic.[1]\\r\\nAlthough frogs have lungs, they absorb oxygen through their skin; for this to occur efficiently, the skin must be moist. A disadvantage of moist skin is that pathogens such as molds and bacteria can thrive on it, increasing the chance of infection. To counteract this, frogs secrete peptides that destroy these pathogens. The secretion from the paratoid gland of the green tree frog contains 25 caerins, a group of peptides with antibacterial and antiviral properties. The caerins produced by frogs of this species from different geographical localities have subtle but reproducible differences.[21] The secretions also contain caeruleins, which have the same physiological effects as CCK-8, a digestive hormone and hunger suppressant.[22] These caeruleins now have a number of clinical applications.[8] Several peptides from the skin secretions of the green tree frog have been found to destroy HIV without harming healthy T cells.[23][24][25]\\r\\nThe fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the causal agent of chytridiomycosis, is causing declines in many species of amphibians, but the secretions produced by the green tree frog and certain other Australian species of frog (Litoria chloris and Litoria genimaculata) are protective against this fungus. The peptides inhibit the growth of the fungus in vitro and these frog species are believed not to be in decline.[26]\\r\\nGreen tree frogs are sometimes used as model animals in research.[27] The structure of their toe pads was used to investigate the microstructure and properties of the epithelium that allows the animals to adhere to wet surfaces.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Litoria caerulea at Wikimedia Commons\\r\\n Data related to Litoria caerulea at Wikispecies","input":"Where do green tree frogs lay their eggs?"},{"output":"Judaism","context":"Monotheism has been defined as the belief in the existence of only one god that created the world, is all-powerful and intervenes in the world.[1][2][3] A broader definition of monotheism is the belief in one god.[4][5][6][7] A distinction may be made between exclusive monotheism, and both inclusive monotheism and pluriform (panentheistic) monotheism which, while recognising various distinct gods, postulate some underlying unity.[8]\\r\\nMonotheism is distinguished from henotheism, a religious system in which the believer worships one god without denying that others may worship different gods with equal validity, and monolatrism, the recognition of the existence of many gods but with the consistent worship of only one deity.[9] The term \\"monolatry\\" was perhaps first used by Julius Wellhausen.[10]\\r\\nThe broader definition of monotheism characterizes the traditions of Bbism, the Bah' Faith, Balinese Hinduism, Cao Dai (Caodaiism), Cheondoism (Cheondogyo), Christianity, Deism, Eckankar, Hindu sects such as Shaivism and Vaishnavism, Islam, Judaism, Mandaeism, Rastafari, Seicho no Ie, Sikhism, Tengrism (Tangrism), Tenrikyo (Tenriism), Yazidism, and Zoroastrianism, and elements of pre-monotheistic thought are found in early religions such as Atenism, ancient Chinese religion, and Yahwism.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word monotheism comes from the Greek ??

A possible inclination towards monotheism emerged during the Vedic period[16] in Iron-Age South Asia. The Rigveda exhibits notions of monism of the Brahman, particularly in the comparatively late tenth book,[17] which is dated to the early Iron Age, e.g. in the Nasadiya sukta. Bonpa Dharma, perhaps from twentieth century BCE,[18] was the first recorded religion to declare that there is one God above all, whom it calls Sangpo Bumtri.[19] However, it does not encourage monotheistic worship of a Sangpo Bumtri or any god for salvation but rather it focuses on karma.\\r\\nSince the sixth century BCE, Zoroastrians have believed in the supremacy of one God above all: Ahura Mazda as the \\"Maker of All\\"[20] and the first being before all others.[21][22][23][24] Nonetheless, Zoroastrianism was not strictly monotheistic[25] because it venerated other yazatas alongside Ahura Mazda. Ancient Hindu theology, meanwhile, was monist, but was not strictly monotheistic in worship because it still maintained the existence of many gods, who were envisioned as aspects of one supreme God, Brahman.[26] Numerous ancient Greek philosophers, including Xenophanes of Colophon and Antisthenes believed in a similar polytheistic monism that came close to monotheism, but fell short.[26] Judaism was the first religion to conceive the notion of a personal monotheistic God within a monist context.[26] The concept of ethical monotheism, which holds that morality stems from God alone and that its laws are unchanging,[27][28] first occurred in Judaism,[29] but is now a core tenet of most modern monotheistic religions, including Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and Bah' Faith.[30]\\r\\nAccording to Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, monotheism was the original religion of humanity; this original religion is sometimes referred to as \\"the Adamic religion\\", or, in the terms of Andrew Lang, the \\"Urreligion\\". Scholars of religion largely abandoned that view in the 19th century in favour of an evolutionary progression from animism via polytheism to monotheism, but by 1974 this theory was less widely held, and a modified view similar to Lang's became more prominent.[2][need quotation to verify] Austrian anthropologist Wilhelm Schmidt had postulated an Urmonotheismus, \\"original\\" or \\"primitive monotheism\\" in the 1910s.[31] It was objected[by whom?] that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam had grown up in opposition to polytheism as had Greek philosophical monotheism.[2] More recently, Karen Armstrong[32] and other authors have returned to the idea of an evolutionary progression beginning with animism, which developed into polytheism, which developed into henotheism, which developed into monolatry, which developed into true monotheism.[33]\\r\\nWhile all adherents of the Abrahamic religions consider themselves to be monotheists, some in Judaism do not consider Christianity to be a pure form of monotheism (due to The Christian doctrine of the Trinity), classifying it as Shituf.[34][35] Islam likewise does not recognize modern-day Christianity as monotheistic, primarily due to the Christian doctrine of Trinity, which Islam argues was not a part of the original monotheistic Christianity as preached by Jesus.[36] Christians, on the other hand, argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is a valid expression of monotheism, citing that the Trinity does not consist of three separate deities, but rather the three persons, who exist consubstantially (as one substance) within a single Godhead.[37][38][39]\\r\\nJudaism is one of the oldest monotheistic religions in the world.[40] God in Judaism is strictly monotheistic,[41] an absolute one, indivisible, and incomparable being who is the ultimate cause of all existence. The Babylonian Talmud references other, \\"foreign gods\\" as non-existent entities to whom humans mistakenly ascribe reality and power.[42] One of the best-known statements of Rabbinical Judaism on monotheism is the Second of Maimonides' 13 Principles of faith:\\r\\nGod, the Cause of all, is one. This does not mean one as in one of a pair, nor one like a species (which encompasses many individuals), nor one as in an object that is made up of many elements, nor as a single simple object that is infinitely divisible. Rather, God is a unity unlike any other possible unity.[43]\\r\\nSome in Judaism[44] and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Judaism uses the term shituf to refer to the worship of God in a manner which Judaism deems to be neither purely monotheistic (though still permissible for non-jews) nor polytheistic (which would be prohibited).[45]\\r\\nDuring the 8th century BCE, the worship of YHWH in Israel was in competition with many other cults, described by the Yahwist faction collectively as Baals. The oldest books of the Hebrew Bible reflect this competition, as in the books of Hosea and Nahum, whose authors lament the \\"apostasy\\" of the people of Israel, threatening them with the wrath of God if they do not give up their polytheistic cults.[46][47]\\r\\nAncient Israelite religion was originally polytheistic;[48] the Israelites worshipped many deities,[49] including El, Baal, Asherah, and Astarte. YHWH was originally the national god of the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah.[49] As time progressed, the henotheistic cult of Yahweh grew increasingly militant in its opposition to the worship of other gods.[48] Later, the reforms of King Josiah imposed a form of strict monolatrism. After the fall of Judah to Babylon, a small circle of priests and scribes gathered around the exiled royal court, where they first developed the concept of YHWH as the sole God of the world.[26]\\r\\nShema Yisrael (\\"Hear, [O] Israel\\") are the first two words of a section of the Torah, and is the title of a prayer that serves as a centerpiece of the morning and evening Jewish prayer services. The first verse encapsulates the monotheistic essence of Judaism: \\"Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is one\\" (Hebrew: ?????? ?????????? ?' ?????????? ?' ??????), found in Deuteronomy 6:4, sometimes alternatively translated as \\"The LORD is our God, the LORD alone.\\" Observant Jews consider the Shema to be the most important part of the prayer service in Judaism, and its twice-daily recitation as a mitzvah (religious commandment). It is traditional for Jews to say the Shema as their last words, and for parents to teach their children to say it before they go to sleep at night.\\r\\nAmong early Christians there was considerable debate over the nature of the Godhead, with some denying the incarnation but not the deity of Jesus (Docetism) and others later calling for an Arian conception of God. Despite at least one earlier local synod rejecting the claim of Arius, this Christological issue was to be one of the items addressed at the First Council of Nicaea.\\r\\nThe First Council of Nicaea, held in Nicaea (in present-day Turkey), convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 325, was the first ecumenical[51] council of bishops of the Roman Empire, and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian doctrine, called the Nicene Creed. With the creation of the creed, a precedent was established for subsequent general ecumenical councils of bishops (synods) to create statements of belief and canons of doctrinal orthodoxy the intent being to define a common creed for the Church and address heretical ideas.\\r\\nOne purpose of the council was to resolve disagreements in Alexandria over the nature of Jesus in relationship to the Father; in particular, whether Jesus was of the same substance as God the Father or merely of similar substance. All but two bishops took the first position; while Arius' argument failed.\\r\\nChristian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and most Protestants) follow this decision, which was reaffirmed in 381 at the First Council of Constantinople and reached its full development through the work of the Cappadocian Fathers. They consider God to be a triune entity, called the Trinity, comprising three \\"persons\\", God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These three are described as being \\"of the same substance\\" (???).\\r\\nChristians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the Nicene Creed (and others), which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity, begins: \\"I believe in one God\\". From earlier than the times of the Nicene Creed, 325?CE, various Christian figures advocated[52] the triune mystery-nature of God as a normative profession of faith. According to Roger E. Olson and Christopher Hall, through prayer, meditation, study and practice, the Christian community concluded \\"that God must exist as both a unity and trinity\\", codifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th century.[53]\\r\\nMost modern Christians believe the Godhead is triune, meaning that the three persons of the Trinity are in one union in which each person is also wholly God. They also hold to the doctrine of a man-god Christ Jesus as God incarnate. These Christians also do not believe that one of the three divine figures is God alone and the other two are not but that all three are mysteriously God and one. Other Christian religions, including Unitarian Universalism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormonism and others, do not share those views on the Trinity.\\r\\nSome Christian faiths, such as Mormonism, argue that the Godhead is in fact three separate individuals which include God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.[54] Each individual having a distinct purpose in the grand existence of human kind.[55] Furthermore, Mormons believe that before the Council of Nicaea, the predominant belief among many early Christians was that the Godhead was three separate individuals. In support of this view, they cite early Christian examples of belief in subordinationism.[56]\\r\\nUnitarianism is a theological movement, named for its understanding of God as one person, in direct contrast to Trinitarianism.[57]\\r\\nIn Islam, God (Allh) is all-powerful and all-knowing, the creator, sustainer, ordainer and judge of the universe.[58][59] God in Islam is strictly singular (tawhid)[60] unique (wahid) and inherently One (ahad), all-merciful and omnipotent.[61] Allh exists without place[62] and the Qur'an states that \\"No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. God is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things\\" (Qur'an 6:103)[59] Allh is the only God and the same God worshiped in Christianity and Judaism. (29:46).[63]\\r\\nIslam emerged in the 7th century CE in the context of both Christianity and Judaism, with some thematic elements similar to Gnosticism.[64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71] Islamic belief states that Muhammad did not bring a new religion from God, but is rather the same religion as practiced by Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus and all the other prophets of God.[72] The assertion of Islam is that the message of God had been corrupted, distorted or lost over time and the Quran was sent to Muhammad in order to correct the lost message of the Torah, New Testament and prior scriptures from God.[73]\\r\\nThe Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the creation.[74] The Qur'an rejects binary modes of thinking such as the idea of a duality of God by arguing that both good and evil generate from God's creative act. God is a universal god rather than a local, tribal or parochial one; an absolute who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil.[75] Ash'ari theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, insists on ultimate divine transcendence and holds that divine unity is not accessible to human reason. Ash'arism teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what was has been revealed through the prophets, and on such paradoxes as God's creation of evil, revelation has to accepted bila kayfa (without [asking] how).[76]\\r\\nTawhid constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession of faith, \\"There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God.[77] To attribute divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the Qur'an.[75] The entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of tawhid.[78]\\r\\nAs they traditionally profess a concept of monotheism with a singular person as God, Judaism[44] and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Judaism uses the term Shituf to refer to non-monotheistic ways of worshiping God. Though Muslims venerate Jesus (Isa in Arabic) as a prophet, they do not accept the doctrine that he was a begotten son of God.\\r\\nAccording to the Quran, the Sabians were a monotheistic religious group.[79] Some Hadiths account them as converts to Islam.[80] However this interpretation may be related to the fact that Quraysh polytheists used to describe anyone who converted to Islam with the word \\"Saba\\"[citation needed] (???/????) which may either mean that this term was used for anyone who changed his religion or that they identified the message of Muhammed as a \\"Sabian belief\\". The former linguistic explanation (i.e. saba = changed his religion) is the one adopted by most Muslim scholars.\\r\\nSabians are often identified with Mandaeism, a small monotheistic community which lives today in Iraq and call themselves Yahyawiya (Arabic: ????????). Muslim scholars traditionally viewed them as followers of the prophets Noah and Yahya (i.e. John the Baptist).[81]\\r\\nGod in the Bah' Faith is taught to be a personal god, too great for humans to fully comprehend. Human primitive understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his divine intermediary Manifestations.[82][83] In the Bah' faith, such Christian doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising the Bah' view that God is single and has no equal.[84] And the very existence of the Bah' Faith is a challenge to the Islamic doctrine of the finality of Muhammad's revelation.[85] God in the Bah' Faith communicates to humanity through divine intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God.[86] These Manifestations establish religion in the world.[83] It is through these divine intermediaries that humans can approach God, and through them God brings divine revelation and law.[87]\\r\\nThe Oneness of God is one of the core teachings of the Bah' Faith. The obligatory prayers in the Bah' Faith involve explicit monotheistic testimony.[88][89] God is the imperishable, uncreated being who is the source of all existence.[90] He is described as \\"a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty\\".[91][92] Although transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation. The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator.[93] God communicates his will and purpose to humanity through intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God, who are the prophets and messengers that have founded religions from prehistoric times up to the present day.[86]\\r\\nAmenhotep IV initially introduced Atenism in Year 5 of his reign (1348/1346 BCE) during the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom. He raised Aten, once a relatively obscure Egyptian Solar deity representing the disk of the sun, to the status of Supreme God in the Egyptian pantheon.[94] To emphasise the change, Aten's name was written in the cartouche form normally reserved for Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. This religious reformation appears to coincide with the proclamation of a Sed festival, a sort of royal jubilee intended to reinforce the Pharaoh's divine powers of kingship. Traditionally held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh's reign, this possibly was a festival in honour of Amenhotep III, who some Egyptologists think had a coregency with his son Amenhotep IV of two to twelve years.\\r\\nYear 5 is believed to mark the beginning of Amenhotep IV's construction of a new capital, Akhetaten (Horizon of the Aten), at the site known today as Amarna. Evidence of this appears on three of the boundary stelae used to mark the boundaries of this new capital. At this time, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten (Agreeable to Aten) as evidence of his new worship. The date given for the event has been estimated to fall around January 2 of that year. In Year 7 of his reign (1346/1344 BCE), the capital was moved from Thebes to Akhetaten (near modern Amarna), though construction of the city seems to have continued for two more years. In shifting his court from the traditional ceremonial centres Akhenaten was signalling a dramatic transformation in the focus of religious and political power.\\r\\nThe move separated the Pharaoh and his court from the influence of the priesthood and from the traditional centres of worship, but his decree had deeper religious significance tootaken in conjunction with his name change, it is possible that the move to Amarna was also meant as a signal of Akhenaten's symbolic death and rebirth. It may also have coincided with the death of his father and the end of the coregency. In addition to constructing a new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive temple complexes in ancient Egypt, including one at Karnak and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of Amun.\\r\\nIn Year 9 (1344/1342 BCE), Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion, declaring Aten not merely the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon, but the only God of Egypt, with himself as the sole intermediary between the Aten and the Egyptian people. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the Great Hymn to the Aten: \\"O Sole God beside whom there is none\\".\\r\\nThe details of Atenist theology are still unclear. The exclusion of all but one god and the prohibition of idols was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition, but most scholars see Akhenaten as a practitioner of monolatry rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but Aten. It is known that Atenism did not solely attribute divinity to the Aten. Akhenaten continued the cult of the Pharaoh, proclaiming himself the son of Aten and encouraging the Egyptian people to worship him.[95] The Egyptian people were to worship Akhenaten; only Akhenaten and Nefertiti could worship Aten directly.[96]\\r\\nUnder Akhenaten's successors, Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.\\r\\nThe orthodox faith system held by most dynasties of China since at least the Shang Dynasty (1766?BCE) until the modern period centered on the worship of Shangdi (literally \\"Above Sovereign\\", generally translated as \\"God\\") or Heaven as an omnipotent force.[97] This faith system pre-dated the development of Confucianism and Taoism and the introduction of Buddhism and Christianity. It has features of monotheism in that Heaven is seen as an omnipotent entity, a noncorporeal force with a personality transcending the world. From the writings of Confucius in the Analects, it is known Confucius believed that Heaven cannot be deceived, Heaven guides people's lives and maintains a personal relationship with them, and that Heaven gives tasks for people to fulfill in order to teach them of virtues and morality.[97] However, this faith system was not truly monotheistic since other lesser gods and spirits, which varied with locality, were also worshiped along with Shangdi. Still, later variants such as Mohism (470 BCEÿc.391 BCE) approached true monotheism, teaching that the function of lesser gods and ancestral spirits is merely to carry out the will of Shangdi, akin to angels in Abrahamic religions. In Mozi's Will of Heaven (), he writes:\\r\\nWill of Heaven, Chapter 27, Paragraph 6, ca. 5th century BCE\\r\\nWorship of Shangdi and Heaven in ancient China includes the erection of shrines, the last and greatest being the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, and the offering of prayers. The ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty would perform annual sacrificial rituals to Shangdi, usually by slaughtering a completely healthy bull as sacrifice. Although its popularity gradually diminished after the advent of Taoism and Buddhism, among other religions, its concepts remained in use throughout the pre-modern period and have been incorporated in later religions in China, including terminology used by early Christians in China. Despite the rising of non-theistic and pantheistic spirituality contributed by Taoism and Buddhism, Shangdi was still praised up until the end of the Qing Dynasty as the last ruler of the Qing declared himself son of heaven.\\r\\nThe Himba people of Namibia practice a form of monotheistic panentheism, and worship the god Mukuru. The deceased ancestors of the Himba and Herero are subservient to him, acting as intermediaries.[98]\\r\\nThe Igbo people practice a form of monotheism called Odinani.[99] Odinani has monotheistic and panentheistic attributes, having a single God as the source of all things. Although a pantheon of spirits exists, these are lesser spirits prevalent in Odinani expressly serving as elements of Chineke (or Chukwu), the supreme being or high god.\\r\\nSome (approximately 3%) of Oromo people follow a traditional monotheistic religion called Waaqeffannaa and God called Waaq.\\r\\nThe supreme god of the Proto-Indo-European religion was the god *Dy?us P?at?r . A number of words derived from the name of this supreme deity are used in various Indo-European languages to denote a monotheistic God. Nonetheless, in spite of this, Proto-Indo-European religion itself was not monotheistic.[100]\\r\\nIn western Eurasia, the ancient traditions of the Slavic religion contained elements of monotheism. In the sixth century AD, the Byzantine chronicler Procopius recorded that the Slavs \\"acknowledge that one god, creator of lightning, is the only lord of all: to him do they sacrifice an ox and all sacrificial animals.\\"[101] The deity to whom Procopius is referring is the storm god Per~n, whose name is derived from *Perkwunos, the Proto-Indo-European god of lightning. The ancient Slavs syncretized him with the Germanic god Thor and the Biblical prophet Elijah.[102]\\r\\nAs an old religion, Hinduism inherits religious concepts spanning monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, and atheism among others;[103][104][105][106] and its concept of God is complex and depends upon each individual and the tradition and philosophy followed.\\r\\nHindu views are broad and range from monism, through pantheism and panentheism (alternatively called monistic theism by some scholars) to monotheism and even atheism. Hinduism cannot be said to be purely polytheistic. Hindu religious leaders have repeatedly stressed that while God's forms are many and the ways to communicate with him are many, God is one. The puja of the murti is a way to communicate with the abstract one god (Brahman) which creates, sustains and dissolves creation.[107]\\r\\nRig Veda 1.164.46,\\r\\nTraditions of Gaudiya Vaishnavas, the Nimbarka Sampradaya and followers of Swaminarayan and Vallabha consider Krishna to be the source of all avatars,[108] and the source of Vishnu himself, or to be the same as Narayana. As such, he is therefore regarded as Svayam Bhagavan.[109][110][111]\\r\\nWhen Krishna is recognized to be Svayam Bhagavan, it can be understood that this is the belief of Gaudiya Vaishnavism,[112] the Vallabha Sampradaya,[113] and the Nimbarka Sampradaya, where Krishna is accepted to be the source of all other avatars, and the source of Vishnu himself. This belief is drawn primarily \\"from the famous statement of the Bhagavatam\\"[114] (1.3.28).[115] A viewpoint differing from this theological concept is the concept of Krishna as an avatar of Narayana or Vishnu. It should be however noted that although it is usual to speak of Vishnu as the source of the avataras, this is only one of the names of the God of Vaishnavism, who is also known as Narayana, Vasudeva and Krishna and behind each of those names there is a divine figure with attributed supremacy in Vaishnavism.[116]\\r\\nThe Rig Veda discusses monotheistic thought, as do the Atharva Veda and Yajur Veda: \\"Devas are always looking to the supreme abode of Vishnu\\" (tad vi??o? parama? pada? sad pa?yanti s?raya? Rig Veda 1.22.20)\\r\\n\\"The One Truth, sages know by many names\\" (Rig Veda 1.164.46)[117]\\r\\n\\"When at first the unborn sprung into being, He won His own dominion beyond which nothing higher has been in existence\\" (Atharva Veda 10.7.31)[118]\\r\\n\\"There is none to compare with Him. There is no parallel to Him, whose glory, verily, is great.\\" (Yajur Veda 32.3)[119]\\r\\nThe number of auspicious qualities of God are countless, with the following six qualities (bhaga) being the most important:\\r\\nIn the Shaivite tradition, the Shri Rudram (Sanskrit ???? ???????), to which the Chamakam (?????) is added by scriptural tradition, is a Hindu stotra dedicated to Rudra (an epithet of Shiva), taken from the Yajurveda (TS 4.5, 4.7).[121][122] Shri Rudram is also known as Sri Rudraprasna, ?atarudrؐya, and Rudradhyaya. The text is important in Vedanta where Shiva is equated to the Universal supreme God. The hymn is an early example of enumerating the names of a deity,[123] a tradition developed extensively in the sahasranama literature of Hinduism.\\r\\nThe Nyaya school of Hinduism has made several arguments regarding a monotheistic view. The Naiyanikas have given an argument that such a god can only be one. In the Nyaya Kusumanjali, this is discussed against the proposition of the Mimamsa school that let us assume there were many demigods (devas) and sages (rishis) in the beginning, who wrote the Vedas and created the world. Nyaya says that:\\r\\n[If they assume such] omniscient beings, those endowed with the various superhuman faculties of assuming infinitesimal size, and so on, and capable of creating everything, then we reply that the law of parsimony bids us assume only one such, namely Him, the adorable Lord. There can be no confidence in a non-eternal and non-omniscient being, and hence it follows that according to the system which rejects God, the tradition of the Veda is simultaneously overthrown; there is no other way open.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn other words, Nyaya says that the polytheist would have to give elaborate proofs for the existence and origin of his several celestial spirits, none of which would be logical, and that it is more logical to assume one eternal, omniscient god.[124]\\r\\nSikhi is a monotheistic[125][126] and a revealed religion.[127] God in Sikhi is called Vhigur, and is shapeless, timeless, and sightless: nira?kr, akaal, and alakh. God is present (sarav vipak) in all of creation. God must be seen from \\"the inward eye\\", or the \\"heart\\". Sikhi devotees must meditate to progress towards enlightenment, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.[128]\\r\\nSikhism is a monotheistic faith[129][130] that arose in northern India during the 16th and 17th centuries. Sikhs believe in one, timeless, omnipresent, supreme creator. The opening verse of the Guru Granth Sahib, known as the Mul Mantra, signifies this:\\r\\nThe word \\"?\\" (\\"Ik a?kr\\") has two components. The first is ?, the digit \\"1\\" in Gurmukhi signifying the singularity of the creator. Together the word means: \\"One Universal creator God\\".\\r\\nIt is often said that the 1430 pages of the Guru Granth Sahib are all expansions on the Mul Mantra. Although the Sikhs have many names for God, some derived from Islam and Hinduism, they all refer to the same Supreme Being.\\r\\nThe Sikh holy scriptures refer to the One God who pervades the whole of space and is the creator of all beings in the universe. The following quotation from the Guru Granth Sahib highlights this point:\\r\\n\\"Chant, and meditate on the One God, who permeates and pervades the many beings of the whole Universe. God created it, and God spreads through it everywhere. Everywhere I look, I see God. The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky; there is no place without Him.\\"\\r\\nHowever, there is a strong case for arguing that the Guru Granth Sahib teaches monism due to its non-dualistic tendencies:\\r\\nPunjabi: ??? ?? ???? ?? ?? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ???? ???\\r\\nSikhs believe that God has been given many names, but they all refer to the One God, VhiGur. Sikhs believe that members of other religions such as Islam, Hinduism and Christianity all worship the same God, and the names Allah, Rahim, Karim, Hari, Raam and Paarbrahm are frequently mentioned in the Sikh holy scriptures. Although there is no set reference to God in Sikhism, the most commonly used Sikh reference to God is Akal Purakh (which means \\"the true immortal\\") or Waheguru, the Primal Being.\\r\\nZoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism which makes it unique among the religions of the world. Zoroastrianism proclaims an evolution through time from dualism to monotheism.[131]\\r\\nZoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion,[132] although Zoroastrianism is often regarded[133] as dualistic, duotheistic or bitheistic, for its belief in the hypostatis of the ultimately good Ahura Mazda (creative spirit) and the ultimately evil Angra Mainyu (destructive spirit). Zorastrianism was once one of the largest religions on Earth, as the official religion of the Persian Empire. By some scholars,[who?] the Zoroastrians (\\"Parsis\\" or \\"Zartoshtis\\") are credited with being some of the first monotheists and having had influence on other world religions. Gathered statistics shows the number of adherents at as many as 3.5 million,[134] with adherents living in many regions, including South Asia.\\r\\nThe surviving fragments of the poems of the classical Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon suggest that he held views very similar to those of modern monotheists.[135] His poems harshly criticize the traditional notion of anthropomorphic gods, commenting that \\"...if cattle and horses and lions had hands or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do,... [they] also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies of such a sort as the form they themselves have.\\"[136] Instead, Xenophanes declares that there is \\"...one god, greatest among gods and humans, like mortals neither in form nor in thought.\\"[137] Xenophanes's theology appears to have been monist, but not truly monotheistic in the strictest sense.[26] Although some later philosophers, such as Antisthenes, believed in doctrines similar to those expounded by Xenophanes, his ideas do not appear to have become widely popular.[26]\\r\\nAlthough Plato himself was a polytheist, in his writings, he often presents Socrates as speaking of \\"the god\\" in the singular form. He does, however, often speak of the gods in the plural form as well. The Euthyphro dilemma, for example, is formulated as \\"Is that which is holy loved by the gods because it is holy, or is it holy because it is loved by the gods?\\"[138]\\r\\nThe development of pure (philosophical) monotheism is a product of the Late Antiquity. During the 2nd to 3rd centuries, early Christianity was just one of several competing religious movements advocating monotheism.\\r\\n\\"The One\\" (? ?) is a concept that is prominent in the writings of the Neoplatonists, especially those of the philosopher Plotinus.[139] In the writings of Plotinus, \\"The One\\" is described as an inconceivable, transcendent, all-embodying, permanent, eternal, causative entity that permeates throughout all of existence.[140]\\r\\nA number of oracles of Apollo from Didyma and Clarus, the so-called \\"theological oracles\\", dated to the 2nd and 3rd century CE, proclaim that there is only one highest god, of whom the gods of polytheistic religions are mere manifestations or servants.[141] 4th century CE Cyprus had, besides Christianity, an apparently monotheistic cult of Dionysus.[142]\\r\\nAristotle's concept of the \\"Uncaused Cause\\"never incorporated into the polytheistic ancient Greek religionhas been used by many exponents of Abrahamic religions to justify their arguments for the existence of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God of the Abrahamic religions.\\r\\nThe Hypsistarians were a religious group who believed in a most high god, according to Greek documents. Later revisions of this Hellenic religion were adjusted towards Monotheism as it gained consideration among a wider populace. The worship of Zeus as the head-god signaled a trend in the direction of monotheism, with less honour paid to the fragmented powers of the lesser gods.\\r\\nVarious New religious movements, such as Cao ?i, Tenrikyo, Seicho no Ie, and Cheondoism, are monotheistic.\\r\\nTengrism or Tangrism (sometimes stylized as Tengriism), occasionally referred to as Tengrianism , is a modern term[143] for a Central Asian religion characterized by features of shamanism, animism, totemism, both polytheism and monotheism,[144][145][146][147] and ancestor worship. Historically, it was the prevailing religion of the Bulgarians, Turks, Mongols, and Hungarians, as well as the Xiongnu and the Huns.[148][149] It was the state religion of the six ancient Turkic states: Avar Khaganate, Old Great Bulgaria, First Bulgarian Empire, G?ktrks Khaganate, Eastern Tourkia and Western Turkic Khaganate. In Irk Bitig, Tengri is mentioned as Trk T?ngrisi (God of Turks).[150] The term is perceived among Turkic peoples as a national religion.\\r\\nIn Sino-Tibetan and Turco-Mongol traditions, the Supreme God is commonly referred to as the ruler of Heaven, or the Sky Lord granted with omnipotent powers, but it has largely diminished in those regions due to ancestor worship, Taoism's pantheistic views and Buddhism's rejection of a creator God, although Mahayana Buddhism does seem to keep a sense of divinity. On some occasions in the mythology, the Sky Lord as identified as a male has been associated to mate with an Earth Mother, while some traditions kept the omnipotence of the Sky Lord unshared.\\r\\nNative American theology may be monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, animistic, or some combination thereof.\\r\\nCherokee for example are monotheist as well as pantheist.\\r\\nThe Great Spirit, called Wakan Tanka among the Sioux,[151] and Gitche Manitou in Algonquian, is a conception of universal spiritual force, or supreme being prevalent among some Native American and First Nation cultures.[152] According to Lakota activist Russell Means a better translation of Wakan Tanka is the Great Mystery.[153]\\r\\nSome researchers have interpreted Aztec philosophy as fundamentally monotheistic or panentheistic. While the populace at large believed in a polytheistic pantheon, Aztec priests and nobles might have come to an interpretation of Teotl as a single universal force with many facets.[154] There has been criticism to this idea, however, most notably that many assertions of this supposed monotheism might actually come from post-Conquistador bias, imposing an Antiquity pagan model unto the Aztec.[155]\\r\\nHence all the power of magic became dissolved; and every bond of wickedness was destroyed, men's ignorance was taken away, and the old kingdom abolished God Himself appearing in the form of a man, for the renewal of eternal life.\\r\\nWe have also as a Physician the Lord our God Jesus the Christ the only-begotten Son and Word, before time began, but who afterwards became also man, of Mary the virgin.

In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.\\r\\nMaple syrup was first collected and used by the indigenous peoples of North America, and the practice was adopted by European settlers, who gradually refined production methods. Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing. The Canadian province of Quebec is by far the largest producer, responsible for 70 percent of the world's output; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2016 were C$ 487 million (about US$ 360 million), with Quebec accounting for some 90 percent of this total.[1][2] Vermont is the largest producer in the United States, generating about six percent of the global supply.\\r\\nMaple syrup is graded according to the Canada, United States, or Vermont scales based on its density and translucency. Sucrose is the most prevalent sugar in maple syrup. In Canada, syrups must be made exclusively from maple sap to qualify as maple syrup and must also be at least 66 percent sugar.[3] In the United States, a syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap to be labelled as \\"maple\\", though states such as Vermont and New York have more restrictive definitions (see below).\\r\\nMaple syrup is often eaten with pancakes, waffles, French toast, oatmeal or porridge. It is also used as an ingredient in baking and as a sweetener or flavouring agent. Culinary experts have praised its unique flavour, although the chemistry responsible is not fully understood.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThree species of maple trees are predominantly used to produce maple syrup: the sugar maple (Acer saccharum), the black maple (A. nigrum), and the red maple (A. rubrum),[5] because of the high sugar content (roughly two to five percent) in the sap of these species.[6] The black maple is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of A. saccharum, the sugar maple, by some botanists.[7] Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavour of the sap.[8]\\r\\nA few other (but not all) species of maple (Acer) are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple syrup, including the box elder or Manitoba maple (Acer negundo),[9] the silver maple (A. saccharinum),[10] and the bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum).[11] Similar syrups may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources.[12][13]\\r\\nIndigenous peoples living in northeastern North America were the first groups known to have produced maple syrup and maple sugar. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region.[14][15] There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began,[16] but various legends exist; one of the most popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief.[15] Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance.[17] Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup.[15]\\r\\nThe Algonquians recognized maple sap as a source of energy and nutrition. At the beginning of the spring thaw, they used stone tools to make V-shaped incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into buckets, which were often made from birch bark.[16] The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stones into the buckets[18] or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top. While there was widespread agriculture in Mesoamerica and the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States, the production of maple syrup is one of only a few agricultural processes in the Northeast that is not a European colonial import.[16]\\r\\nIn the early stages of European colonization in northeastern North America, local Indigenous peoples showed the arriving colonists how to tap the trunks of certain types of maples during the spring thaw to harvest the sap.[19] Andr Thevet, the \\"Royal Cosmographer of France\\", wrote about Jacques Cartier drinking maple sap during his Canadian voyages.[20] By 1680, European settlers and fur traders were involved in harvesting maple products.[21] However, rather than making incisions in the bark, the Europeans used the method of drilling tapholes in the trunks with augers. During the 17th and 18th centuries, processed maple sap was used primarily as a source of concentrated sugar, in both liquid and crystallized-solid form, as cane sugar had to be imported from the West Indies.[16][17]\\r\\nMaple sugaring parties typically began to operate at the start of the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples.[19] Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks, usually more than one hole per large tree; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap. The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment's core from one end of the cylinder, creating a seamless, watertight container.[16] Sap filled the buckets, and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels (barrels, large pots, or hollowed-out wooden logs), often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by draft animals, or carried in buckets or other convenient containers.[22] The sap-collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees, and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained \\"sweet\\". The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were, and still are, critical in determining the length of the sugaring season.[23] As the weather continues to warm, a maple tree's normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap, making it unpalatable, perhaps due to an increase in amino acids.[10]\\r\\nThe boiling process was very time-consuming. The harvested sap was transported back to the party's base camp, where it was then poured into large vessels (usually made from metal) and boiled to achieve the desired consistency.[16] The sap was usually transported using large barrels pulled by horses or oxen to a central collection point, where it was processed either over a fire built out in the open or inside a shelter built for that purpose (the \\"sugar shack\\").[16][24]\\r\\nAround the time of the American Civil War (1861-1865), syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more efficient for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation.[24] Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time.[16] Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.[24]\\r\\nBuckets began to be replaced with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used.[16] Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap.[24] Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.[25]\\r\\nA large number of technological changes took place during the 1970s. Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since the early part of the century were perfected, and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house.[26] Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.[16]\\r\\nImprovements in tubing and vacuum pumps, new filtering techniques, \\"supercharged\\" preheaters, and better storage containers have since been developed. Research continues on pest control and improved woodlot management.[16] In 2009, researchers at the University of Vermont unveiled a new type of tap that prevents backflow of sap into the tree, reducing bacterial contamination and preventing the tree from attempting to heal the bore hole.[27] Experiments show that it may be possible to use saplings in a plantation instead of mature trees, dramatically boosting productivity per acre.[28]\\r\\nOpen pan evaporation methods have been streamlined since colonial days, but remain basically unchanged. Sap must first be collected and boiled down to obtain pure syrup without chemical agents or preservatives. Maple syrup is made by boiling between 20 and 50 volumes of sap (depending on its concentration) over an open fire until 1 volume of syrup is obtained, usually at a temperature 4.1?C (7.4?F) over the boiling point of water. As the boiling point of water varies with changes in air pressure the correct value for pure water is determined at the place where the syrup is being produced, each time evaporation is begun and periodically throughout the day.[24][29] Syrup can be boiled entirely over one heat source or can be drawn off into smaller batches and boiled at a more controlled temperature.[30]\\r\\nBoiling the syrup is a tightly controlled process, which ensures appropriate sugar content. Syrup boiled too long will eventually crystallize, whereas under-boiled syrup will be watery, and will quickly spoil. The finished syrup has a density of 66 on the Brix scale (a hydrometric scale used to measure sugar solutions).[31] The syrup is then filtered to remove sugar sand, crystals made up largely of sugar and calcium malate.[32] These crystals are not toxic, but create a \\"gritty\\" texture in the syrup if not filtered out.[33]\\r\\nIn addition to open pan evaporation methods, many large producers use the more fuel efficient reverse osmosis procedure to separate the water from the sap.[34]\\r\\nThe higher the sugar content of the sap, the fewer the gallons of sap are needed to obtain one gallon of syrup. 57 gallons of sap with 1.5 percent sugar content will yield 1 gallon of syrup, but only 25 gallons of sap with a 3.5 percent sugar content are needed to obtain one gallon of syrup.[35] The sap's sugar content is highly variable and will fluctuate even within the same tree.[36]\\r\\nThe filtered syrup is graded and packaged while still hot, usually at a temperature of 82?C (180?F) or greater. The containers are turned over after being sealed to sterilize the cap with the hot syrup. Packages can be made of metal, glass, or coated plastic, depending on volume and target market.[37] The syrup can also be heated longer and further processed to create a variety of other maple products, including maple sugar, maple butter or cream, and maple candy or taffy.[38]\\r\\nOff-flavours can sometimes develop during the production of maple syrup, resulting from contaminants in the boiling apparatus (such as disinfectants), microorganisms, fermentation products, metallic can flavours, and \\"buddy sap\\", an off-flavour occurring late in the syrup season when tree budding has begun.[39] In some circumstances, it is possible to remove off-flavours through processing.[39][40]\\r\\nMaple syrup production is centred in northeastern North America; however, given the correct weather conditions, it can be made wherever suitable species of maple trees grow.\\r\\nA maple syrup production farm is called a \\"sugarbush\\" or \\"sugarwood\\". Sap is often boiled in a \\"sugar house\\" (also known as a \\"sugar shack\\", \\"sugar shanty\\", or cabane  sucre), a building louvered at the top to vent the steam from the boiling sap.[41]\\r\\nMaples are usually tapped beginning at 30 to 40 years of age. Each tree can support between one and three taps, depending on its trunk diameter. The average maple tree will produce 35 to 50 litres (9.2 to 13.2?US?gal) of sap per season, up to 12 litres (3.2?US?gal) per day.[42] This is roughly equal to seven percent of its total sap. Seasons last for four to eight weeks, depending on the weather.[43] During the day, starch stored in the roots for the winter rises through the trunk as sugary sap, allowing it to be tapped.[23] Sap is not tapped at night because the temperature drop inhibits sap flow, although taps are typically left in place overnight.[44] Some producers also tap in autumn, though this practice is less common than spring tapping. Maples can continue to be tapped for sap until they are over 100 years old.[42]\\r\\nUntil the 1930s, the United States produced most of the world's maple syrup.[45] Today, after rapid growth in the 1990s, Canada produces more than 80 percent of the world's maple syrup, producing about 73,000,000 litres (19,000,000?US?gal) in 2016.[1] The vast majority of this comes from the province of Quebec, which is the world's largest producer, with about 70 percent of global production.[1][2]\\r\\nAs of 2016, Quebec had some 7,300 producers working with 13,500 farmers, collectively making over 8,090,000 US gallons (30,600,000?L) of syrup.[1][46] Production in Quebec is controlled through a supply management system, with producers receiving quota allotments from the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers (Fdration des producteurs acricoles du Qubec, FPAQ), which also maintains reserves of syrup,[1][47] although there is a black-market trade in Quebec product.[1][48][49] In 2017, the FPAQ mandated increased output of maple syrup production, attempting to establish Quebec's dominance in the world market.[1][2] Canada exported more than C$362 million of maple syrup in 2016.[2] The provinces of Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island produce smaller amounts of syrup.[46]\\r\\nThe Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan produce maple syrup using the sap of the box elder or Manitoba maple (Acer negundo).[9] A Manitoba maple tree's yield is usually less than half that of a similar sugar maple tree.[50] Manitoba maple syrup has a slightly different flavour from sugar-maple syrup, because it contains less sugar and the tree's sap flows more slowly. British Columbia is home to a growing maple sugar industry using sap from the bigleaf maple, which is native to the West Coast of the United States and Canada.[51]\\r\\nVermont is the biggest US producer, with over 1,320,000 US gallons (5,000,000?L) during the 2013 season, followed by New York with 574,000 US gallons (2,170,000?L) and Maine with 450,000 US gallons (1,700,000?L). Wisconsin, Ohio, New Hampshire, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Connecticut all produced marketable quantities of maple syrup of less than 265,000 US gallons (1,000,000?L) each in 2013.[52] As of 2003, Vermont produced about 5.5?percent of the global syrup supply.[53]\\r\\nMaple syrup has been produced on a small scale in some other countries, notably Japan and South Korea.[54] However, in South Korea in particular, it is traditional to consume maple sap, called gorosoe, instead of processing it into syrup.[55]\\r\\nIn 2015, 64 percent of Canadian maple syrup exports went to the United States (a value of C$229 million), 8 percent to Germany (C$31 million), 6 percent to Japan (C$26 million), and 5 percent to the United Kingdom (C$16 million).[46]\\r\\nFollowing an effort from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup producer associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding the classification of maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been a work in progress for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, at the request of the IMSI.[56]\\r\\nAs of December 31, 2014, the CFIA[56] and as of March 2, 2015, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service[57] issued revised standards intended to harmonize Canada-United States regulations on the classification of maple syrup as follows:\\r\\nAs long as maple syrup does not have an off-flavour, is of a uniform colour, and is free from turbidity and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades. If it exhibits any problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements, and then must be labelled as Processing Grade maple syrup and may not be sold in containers smaller than 5 gallons.[56][57] If maple syrup does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade maple syrup (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as Substandard.[56][57]\\r\\nAs of February 2015, this grading system has been accepted and made law by most maple-producing states and provinces, other than Ontario, Quebec,[56] and Ohio. Vermont, in an effort to \\"jump-start\\" the new grading regulations, adopted the new grading system as of January 1, 2014, after the grade changes passed the Senate and House in 2013. Maine passed a bill to take effect as soon as both Canada and the United States adopted the new grades. They are allowing a one-year grace period. In New York, the new grade changes became law on January 1, 2015, with a one-year grace period. New Hampshire did not require legislative approval and so the new grade laws became effective as of December 16, 2014, and producer compliance was required as of January 1, 2016.[58]\\r\\nGolden and Amber grades typically have a milder flavour than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark and have an intense maple flavour.[59] The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use.[60] Syrup harvested earlier in the season tends to yield a lighter colour.[61] With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560?nm wavelength through a 10?mm sample. Golden has to have 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.[57]\\r\\nIn Canada, maple syrup was classified prior to December 31, 2014, by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as one of three grades, each with several colour classes:[56]\\r\\nProducers in Ontario or Quebec may have followed either federal or provincial grading guidelines.[56] Quebec's and Ontario's guidelines differed slightly from the federal:\\r\\nA typical year's yield for a maple syrup producer will be about 25 to 30 percent of each of the #1 colours, 10 percent #2 Amber, and 2 percent #3 Dark.[31]\\r\\nThe United States used (some states still do, as they await state regulation) different grading standards. Maple syrup was divided into two major grades:\\r\\nIn Massachusetts, the Grade B was renamed as Grade A Very Dark, Strong Taste.[64]\\r\\nThe Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets used a similar grading system of colour, and is roughly equivalent, especially for lighter syrups, but using letters: \\"AA\\", \\"A\\", etc.[65][66] The Vermont grading system differed from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density (measured on the Baum scale). New Hampshire maintained a similar standard, but not a separate state grading scale. The Vermont-graded product had 0.9 percent more sugar and less water in its composition than US-graded. One grade of syrup not for table use, called commercial or Grade C, was also produced under the Vermont system.[59]\\r\\nThe basic ingredient in maple syrup is the sap from the xylem of sugar maple or various other species of maple trees. It consists primarily of sucrose and water, with small amounts of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose from the invert sugar created in the boiling process.[67]\\r\\nIn a 100g amount, maple syrup provides 260 calories and is composed of 32 percent water by weight, 67 percent carbohydrates (90 percent of which are sugars), and no appreciable protein or fat (table). Maple syrup is generally low in overall micronutrient content, although manganese and riboflavin are at high levels along with moderate amounts of zinc and calcium (right table). It also contains trace amounts of amino acids which increase in content as sap flow occurs.[68]\\r\\nMaple syrup contains a wide variety of volatile organic compounds, including vanillin, hydroxybutanone, and propionaldehyde. It is not yet known exactly what compounds are responsible for maple syrup's distinctive flavour,[32] however its primary flavour contributing compounds are maple furanone, strawberry furanone, and maltol.[69]\\r\\nNew compounds have been identified in maple syrup, one of which is quebecol, a natural phenolic compound created when the maple sap is boiled to create syrup.[70]\\r\\nOne author described maple syrup as \\"a unique ingredient, smooth- and silky-textured, with a sweet, distinctive flavour ÿ hints of caramel with overtones of toffee will not do ÿ and a rare colour, amber set alight. Maple flavour is, well, maple flavour, uniquely different from any other.\\"[44] Agriculture Canada has developed a \\"flavour wheel\\" that details 91 unique flavours that can be present in maple syrup. These flavours are divided into 13 families: vanilla, empyreumatic (burnt), milky, fruity, floral, spicy, foreign (deterioration or fermentation), foreign (environment), maple, confectionery, plant (herbaceous), plant (forest, humus or cereals), and plant (ligneous).[71][72] These flavours are evaluated using a procedure similar to wine tasting.[73] Other culinary experts praise its unique flavour.[74][75][76][77]\\r\\nMaple syrup and its various artificial imitations are widely used as toppings for pancakes, waffles, and French toast in North America. They can also be used to flavour a variety of foods, including fritters, ice cream, hot cereal, fresh fruit, and sausages. It is also used as sweetener for granola, applesauce, baked beans, candied sweet potatoes, winter squash, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and hot toddies. Maple syrup can also be used as a replacement for honey in wine (mead).[78]\\r\\nIn Canada, maple syrup must be made entirely from maple sap, and syrup must have a density of 66 on the Brix scale to be marketed as maple syrup.[31] In the United States, maple syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap, although small amounts of substances such as salt may be added.[79] Labeling laws prohibit imitation syrups from having \\"maple\\" in their names unless the finished product contains 10 percent or more of natural maple syrup.[79]\\r\\n\\"Maple-flavoured\\" syrups include maple syrup, but may contain additional ingredients.[79] \\"Pancake syrup\\", \\"waffle syrup\\", \\"table syrup\\", and similarly named syrups are substitutes which are less expensive than maple syrup. In these syrups, the primary ingredient is most often high-fructose corn syrup flavoured with sotolon; they have little genuine maple content, and are usually thickened above the viscosity of maple syrup.[80]\\r\\nImitation syrups are generally cheaper than maple syrup, with less natural flavour.[80] In the United States, consumers generally prefer imitation syrups, likely because of the significantly lower cost and sweeter flavour;[81][82] they typically cost about $8 per gallon (1 US gallon (3,800?ml)), whereas authentic maple syrup costs $40 to $60 per gallon (2015 prices).[82]\\r\\nIn 2016, maple syrup producers from nine US states petitioned the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate labeling of products containing maple syrup or using the word \\"maple\\" in manufactured products, indicating that imitation maple products contained insignificant amounts of natural maple syrup.[83] In September 2016, the FDA published a consumer advisory to carefully inspect the ingredient list of products labeled as \\"maple\\".[84]\\r\\nMaple products are considered emblematic of Canada, in particular Quebec, and are frequently sold in tourist shops and airports as souvenirs from Canada. The sugar maple's leaf has come to symbolize Canada, and is depicted on the country's flag.[85] Several US states, including New York, Vermont and Wisconsin, have the sugar maple as their state tree.[86] A scene of sap collection is depicted on the Vermont state quarter, issued in 2001.[87]\\r\\nMaple syrup and maple sugar were used during the American Civil War and by abolitionists in the years before the war because most cane sugar and molasses were produced by Southern slaves.[81][88] Because of food rationing during the Second World War, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup and maple sugar,[16] and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.[89]","input":"Where is maple syrup produced in the world?"},{"output":"an extensive road system of more than 30,000 kilometers, although much of it is in disrepair","context":"There are many modes of transport in Costa Rica but the country's infrastructure has suffered from a lack of maintenance and new investment.

An August 2016 OECD report provided this summary: \\"The road network is extensive but of poor quality, railways are in disrepair and only slowly being reactivated after having been shut down in the 1990s, seaports quality and capacity are deficient. Internal transportation overly relies on private road vehicles as the public transport system, especially railways, is inadequate.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road system in Costa Rica is not as developed as it might be expected for such a country.

The forced relocations were carried out by government authorities following the passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830. Many of the relocated people suffered from exposure, disease, and starvation while en route to their new designated reserve, and many died before reaching their destinations. The forced removals included members of the Cherokee, Muscogee (Creek), Seminole, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Ponca nations. The phrase \\"Trail of Tears\\" originates from a description of the removal of many Native American tribes, including the infamous Cherokee Nation relocation in 1838.[1][2][3]\\r\\nBetween 1830 and 1850, the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole, and Cherokee people (including mixed-race and black freedmen and slaves who lived among them) were forcibly removed from their traditional lands in the Southeastern United States, and relocated farther west.[4] Those Native Americans who were relocated were forced to march to their destinations by state and local militias.[5] The Cherokee removal in 1838 (the last forced removal east of the Mississippi) was brought on by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega, Georgia in 1828, resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush.[6] Approximately 2,000ÿ6,000 of the 16,543 relocated Cherokee perished along the way.[7][8][9][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1830, a group of Indians collectively referred to as the Five Civilized Tribes (the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee, and Seminole tribes) were living as autonomous nations in what would be later called the American Deep South. The process of cultural transformation, as proposed by George Washington and Henry Knox, was gaining momentum, especially among the Cherokee and Choctaw.[12]\\r\\nAmerican settlers had been pressuring the federal government to remove Indians from the Southeast; many settlers were encroaching on Indian lands, while others wanted more land made available to white settlers. Although the effort was vehemently opposed by some, including U.S. Congressman Davy Crockett of Tennessee, President Andrew Jackson was able to gain Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which authorized the government to extinguish Indian title to lands in the Southeast.\\r\\nIn 1831, the Choctaw became the first Nation to be removed, and their removal served as the model for all future relocations. After two wars, many Seminoles were removed in 1832. The Creek removal followed in 1834, the Chickasaw in 1837, and lastly the Cherokee in 1838.[13] However, some managed to evade the removals and remained in their ancestral homelands; some Choctaw are living in Mississippi, Creek in Alabama and Florida, Cherokee in North Carolina, and Seminole in Florida; a small group had escaped into the Everglades and were never defeated by the United States government.[clarification needed] A small number of non-Native Americans who lived with the tribes, including some of African descent (some as slaves, and others as spouses or freedmen), also accompanied the Indians on the trek westward.[13] By 1837, 46,000 Indians from the southeastern states had been removed from their homelands, thereby opening 25?million acres (100,000?km2) for predominantly white settlement.[13]\\r\\nPrior to 1838, the fixed boundaries of these autonomous tribal nations, comprising large areas of the United States, were subject to continual cession and annexation, in part due to pressure from squatters and the threat of military force in the newly declared U.S. territoriesfederally administered regions whose boundaries supervened upon the Native treaty claims. As these territories became U.S. states, state governments sought to dissolve the boundaries of the Indian nations within their borders, which were independent of state jurisdiction, and to expropriate the land therein. These pressures were exacerbated by U.S. population growth and the expansion of slavery in the South, with the rapid development of cotton cultivation in the uplands following the invention of the cotton gin.[14]\\r\\nThe removals, conducted under Presidents Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, followed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which provided the President with powers to exchange land with Native tribes and provide infrastructure improvements on the existing lands. The law also gave the president power to pay for transportation costs to the West, should tribes choose to relocate. The law did not, however, allow the President to force tribes to move West without a mutually agreed-upon treaty.[15]\\r\\nIn the years following the Act, the Cherokee filed several lawsuits regarding conflicts with the state of Georgia. Some of these cases reached the Supreme Court, the most influential being Worcester v. Georgia (1832). Samuel Worcester and other non-Indians were convicted by Georgia law for residing in Cherokee territory in the state of Georgia without a license. Worcester was sentenced to prison for four years and appealed the ruling, arguing that this sentence violated treaties made between Indian nations and the United States federal government by imposing state laws on Cherokee lands. The Court ruled in Worcester's favor, declaring that the Cherokee Nation was subject only to federal law and that the Supremacy Clause barred legislative interference by the state of Georgia. Chief Justice Marshall argued, \\"The Cherokee nation, then, is a distinct community occupying its own territory in which the laws of Georgia can have no force. The whole intercourse between the United States and this Nation, is, by our constitution and laws, vested in the government of the United States.\\"[16]\\r\\nAndrew Jackson did not listen to the Supreme Court mandate barring Georgia from intruding on Cherokee lands. He feared that enforcement would lead to open warfare between federal troops and the Georgia militia, which would compound the ongoing crisis in South Carolina and lead to a broader civil war. Instead, he vigorously negotiated a land exchange treaty with the Cherokee.[17] Political opponents Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams, who supported the Worcester decision, were outraged by Jackson's refusal to uphold Cherokee claims against the state of Georgia.[18][full citation needed] Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote an account of Cherokee assimilation into the American culture, declaring his support of the Worcester decision.[19]\\r\\nJackson chose to continue with Indian removal, and negotiated The Treaty of New Echota, on December 29, 1835, which granted Cherokee Indians two years to move to Indian Territory (modern Oklahoma). Only a fraction of the Cherokees left voluntarily. The U.S. government, with assistance from state militias, forced most of the remaining Cherokees west in 1838.[20] The Cherokees were temporarily remanded in camps in eastern Tennessee. In November, the Cherokee were broken into groups of around 1,000 each and began the journey west. They endured heavy rains, snow, and freezing temperatures.\\r\\nWhen the Cherokee negotiated the Treaty of New Echota, they exchanged all their land east of the Mississippi for land in modern Oklahoma and a $5 million payment from the federal government. Many Cherokee felt betrayed that their leadership accepted the deal, and over 16,000 Cherokee signed a petition to prevent the passage of the treaty. By the end of the decade in 1840, tens of thousands of Cherokee and other tribes had been removed from their land east of the Mississippi River. The Creek, Choctaw, Seminole, and Chicksaw were also relocated under the Indian Removal Act of 1830. One Choctaw leader portrayed the removal as \\"A Trail of Tears and Deaths\\", a devastating event that removed most of the Native population of the southeastern United States from their traditional homelands.[21]\\r\\nThe latter forced relocations have sometimes been referred to as \\"death marches\\", in particular with reference to the Cherokee march across the Midwest in 1838, which occurred on a predominantly land route.[14]\\r\\nIndians who had the means initially provided for their own removal. Contingents that were led by conductors from the U.S. Army included those led by Edward Deas, who was claimed to be a sympathizer for the Cherokee plight.[citation needed] The largest death toll from the Cherokee forced relocation comes from the period after the May 23, 1838 deadline. This was at the point when the remaining Cherokee were rounded into camps and pressed into oversized detachments, often over 700 in size (larger than the populations of Little Rock or Memphis at that time). Communicable diseases spread quickly through these closely quartered groups, killing many. These contingents were among the last to move, but following the same routes the others had taken; the areas they were going through had been depleted of supplies due to the vast numbers that had gone before them. The marchers were subject to extortion and violence along the route. In addition, these final contingents were forced to set out during the hottest and coldest months of the year, killing many. Exposure to the elements, disease and starvation, harassment by local frontiersmen, and insufficient rations similarly killed up to one-third of the Choctaw and other nations on the march.[22]\\r\\nThere exists some debate among historians and the affected tribes as to whether the term \\"Trail of Tears\\" should be used to refer to the entire history of forced relocations from the United States east of the Mississippi into Indian Territory (as was the stated U.S. policy), or to the Five Tribes described above, to the route of the land march specifically, or to specific marches in which the remaining holdouts from each area were rounded up.\\r\\nThe territorial boundaries claimed as sovereign and controlled by the Indian nations living in what were then known as the Indian Territoriesthe portion of the early United States west of the Mississippi River not yet claimed or allotted to become Oklahomawere fixed and determined by national treaties with the United States federal government. These recognized the tribal governments as dependent but internally sovereign, or autonomous nations under the sole jurisdiction of the federal government.\\r\\nWhile retaining their tribal governance, which included a constitution or official council in tribes such as the Iroquois and Cherokee, many portions of the southeastern Indian nations had become partially or completely economically integrated into the economy of the region. This included the plantation economy in states such as Georgia, and the possession of slaves. These slaves were also forcibly relocated during the process of removal.[14] A similar process had occurred earlier in the territories controlled by the Confederacy of the Six Nations in what is now upstate New York prior to the British invasion and subsequent U.S. annexation of the Iroquois nation.\\r\\nUnder the history of U.S. treaty law, the territorial boundaries claimed by federally recognized tribes received the same status under which the Southeastern tribal claims were recognized; until the following establishment of reservations of land, determined by the federal government, which were ceded to the remaining tribes by de jure treaty, in a process that often entailed forced relocation. The establishment of the Indian Territory and the extinguishment of Indian land claims east of the Mississippi anticipated the establishment of the U.S. Indian reservation system. It was imposed on remaining Indian lands later in the 19th century.\\r\\nThe statutory argument for Indian sovereignty persisted until the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), that (e.g.) the Cherokee were not a sovereign and independent nation, and therefore not entitled to a hearing before the court. However, in Worcester v. Georgia (1832), the court re-established limited internal sovereignty under the sole jurisdiction of the federal government, in a ruling that both opposed the subsequent forced relocation and set the basis for modern U.S. case law.\\r\\nWhile the latter ruling was defied by Jackson,[23] the actions of the Jackson administration were not isolated because state and federal officials had violated treaties without consequence, often attributed to military exigency, as the members of individual Indian nations were not automatically United States citizens and were rarely given standing in any U.S. court.\\r\\nJackson's involvement in what became known as the Trail of Tears cannot be ignored. In a speech regarding Indian removal, Jackson said, \\"It will separate the Indians from immediate contact with settlements of whites; free them from the power of the States; enable them to pursue happiness in their own way and under their own rude institutions; will retard the progress of decay, which is lessening their numbers, and perhaps cause them gradually, under the protection of the Government and through the influence of good counsels, to cast off their savage habits and become an interesting, civilized, and Christian community.\\" According to Jackson, the move would be nothing but beneficial for all parties. His point of view garnered support from many Americans, many of whom would benefit economically from the removal.\\r\\nThis was compounded by the fact that while citizenship tests existed for Indians living in newly annexed areas before and after forced relocation, individual U.S. states did not recognize tribal land claims, only individual title under State law, and distinguished between the rights of white and non-white citizens, who often had limited standing in court; and Indian removal was carried out under U.S. military jurisdiction, often by state militias. As a result, individual Indians who could prove U.S. citizenship were nevertheless displaced from newly annexed areas.[14] The military actions and subsequent treaties enacted by Jackson's and Martin Van Buren's administrations pursuant to the 1830 law, which Tennessee Congressman Davy Crockett had unsuccessfully voted against,[24] are widely considered to have directly caused the expulsion or death of a substantial part of the Indian population then living in the southeastern United States.\\r\\nThe Choctaw nation occupied large portions of what are now the U.S. states of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. After a series of treaties starting in 1801, the Choctaw nation was reduced to 11,000,000 acres (45,000?km2). The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek ceded the remaining country to the United States and was ratified in early 1831. The removals were only agreed to after a provision in the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek allowed some Choctaw to remain. The chief of the Choctaw tribe, George W. Harkins, wrote to the citizens of the United States before the removals were to commence:\\r\\nIt is with considerable diffidence that I attempt to address the American people, knowing and feeling sensibly my incompetency; and believing that your highly and well improved minds would not be well entertained by the address of a Choctaw. But having determined to emigrate west of the Mississippi river this fall, I have thought proper in bidding you farewell to make a few remarks expressive of my views, and the feelings that actuate me on the subject of our removal.... We as Choctaws rather chose to suffer and be free, than live under the degrading influence of laws, which our voice could not be heard in their formation.\\r\\nUnited States Secretary of War Lewis Cass appointed George Gaines to manage the removals. Gaines decided to remove Choctaws in three phases starting in 1831 and ending in 1833. The first was to begin on November 1, 1831 with groups meeting at Memphis and Vicksburg. A harsh winter would batter the emigrants with flash floods, sleet, and snow. Initially the Choctaws were to be transported by wagon but floods halted them. With food running out, the residents of Vicksburg and Memphis were concerned. Five steamboats (the Walter Scott, the Brandywine, the Reindeer, the Talma, and the Cleopatra) would ferry Choctaws to their river-based destinations. The Memphis group traveled up the Arkansas for about 60 miles (100?km) to Arkansas Post. There the temperature stayed below freezing for almost a week with the rivers clogged with ice, so there could be no travel for weeks. Food rationing consisted of a handful of boiled corn, one turnip, and two cups of heated water per day. Forty government wagons were sent to Arkansas Post to transport them to Little Rock. When they reached Little Rock, a Choctaw chief referred to their trek as a \\"trail of tears and death\\".[26] The Vicksburg group was led by an incompetent guide and was lost in the Lake Providence swamps.\\r\\nAlexis de Tocqueville, the French philosopher, witnessed the Choctaw removals while in Memphis, Tennessee in 1831:\\r\\nIn the whole scene there was an air of ruin and destruction, something which betrayed a final and irrevocable adieu; one couldn't watch without feeling one's heart wrung. The Indians were tranquil, but sombre and taciturn. There was one who could speak English and of whom I asked why the Chactas were leaving their country. \\"To be free,\\" he answered, could never get any other reason out of him. We ... watch the expulsion ... of one of the most celebrated and ancient American peoples.\\r\\nNearly 17,000 Choctaws made the move to what would be called Indian Territory and then later Oklahoma.[28] About 2,500ÿ6,000 died along the trail of tears. Approximately 5,000ÿ6,000 Choctaws remained in Mississippi in 1831 after the initial removal efforts.[22][29] The Choctaws who chose to remain in newly formed Mississippi were subject to legal conflict, harassment, and intimidation. The Choctaws \\"have had our habitations torn down and burned, our fences destroyed, cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged, manacled, fettered and otherwise personally abused, until by such treatment some of our best men have died\\".[29] The Choctaws in Mississippi were later reformed as the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and the removed Choctaws became the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. The Choctaws were the first to sign a removal treaty presented by the federal government. President Andrew Jackson wanted strong negotiations with the Choctaws in Mississippi, and the Choctaws seemed much more cooperative than Andrew Jackson had imagined. When commissioners and Choctaws came to negotiation agreements it was said the United States would bear the expense of moving their homes and that they had to be removed within two and a half years of the signed treaty.[30]\\r\\nThe U.S. acquired Florida from Spain via the AdamsÿOns Treaty and took possession in 1821. In 1832 the Seminoles were called to a meeting at Payne's Landing on the Ocklawaha River. The treaty negotiated called for the Seminoles to move west, if the land were found to be suitable. They were to be settled on the Creek reservation and become part of the Creek tribe, who considered them deserters; some of the Seminoles had been derived from Creek bands but also from other tribes. Those among the tribe who once were members of Creek bands did not wish to move west to where they were certain that they would meet death for leaving the main band of Creek Indians. The delegation of seven chiefs who were to inspect the new reservation did not leave Florida until October 1832. After touring the area for several months and conferring with the Creeks who had already settled there, the seven chiefs signed a statement on March 28, 1833 that the new land was acceptable. Upon their return to Florida, however, most of the chiefs renounced the statement, claiming that they had not signed it, or that they had been forced to sign it, and in any case, that they did not have the power to decide for all the tribes and bands that resided on the reservation. The villages in the area of the Apalachicola River were more easily persuaded, however, and went west in 1834.[31] On December 28, 1835 a group of Seminoles and blacks ambushed a U.S. Army company marching from Fort Brooke in Tampa to Fort King in Ocala, killing all but three of the 110 army troops. This came to be known as the Dade Massacre.\\r\\nAs the realization that the Seminoles would resist relocation sank in, Florida began preparing for war. The St. Augustine Militia asked the War Department for the loan of 500 muskets. Five hundred volunteers were mobilized under Brig. Gen. Richard K. Call. Indian war parties raided farms and settlements, and families fled to forts, large towns, or out of the territory altogether. A war party led by Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train, killing eight of its guards and wounding six others. Most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia in another fight a few days later. Sugar plantations along the Atlantic coast south of St. Augustine were destroyed, with many of the slaves on the plantations joining the Seminoles.[32]\\r\\nOther warchiefs such as Halleck Tustenuggee, Jumper, and Black Seminoles Abraham and John Horse continued the Seminole resistance against the army. The war ended, after a full decade of fighting, in 1842. The U.S. government is estimated to have spent about $20,000,000 on the war, at the time an astronomical sum, and equal to $507,172,414 today. Many Indians were forcibly exiled to Creek lands west of the Mississippi; others retreated into the Everglades. In the end, the government gave up trying to subjugate the Seminole in their Everglades redoubts and left fewer than 500 Seminoles in peace. However, other scholars state that at least several hundred Seminoles remained in the Everglades after the Seminole Wars.[33]\\r\\nAs a result of the Seminole Wars, the surviving Seminole band of the Everglades claims to be the only federally recognized tribe which never relinquished sovereignty or signed a peace treaty with the United States.\\r\\nIn general the American people tended to view the Indian resistance as unwarranted. An article published by the Virginia Enquirer on January 26, 1836, called the \\"Hostilities of the Seminoles\\", assigned all the blame for the violence that came from the Seminole's resistance to the Seminoles themselves. The article accuses the Indians of not staying true to their wordthe promises they supposedly made in the treaties and negotiations from the Indian Removal Act.[34]\\r\\nAfter the War of 1812, some Muscogee leaders such as William McIntosh signed treaties that ceded more land to Georgia. The 1814 signing of the Treaty of Fort Jackson signaled the end for the Creek Nation and for all Indians in the South.[35] Friendly Creek leaders, like Selocta and Big Warrior, addressed Sharp Knife (the Indian nickname for Andrew Jackson) and reminded him that they keep the peace. Nevertheless, Jackson retorted that they did not \\"cut (Tecumseh's) throat\\" when they had the chance, so they must now cede Creek lands. Jackson also ignored Article 9 of the Treaty of Ghent that restored sovereignty to Indians and their nations.\\r\\nJackson opened this first peace session by faintly acknowledging the help of the friendly Creeks. That done, he turned to the Red Sticks and admonished them for listening to evil counsel. For their crime, he said, the entire Creek Nation must pay. He demanded the equivalent of all expenses incurred by the United States in prosecuting the war, which by his calculation came to 23,000,000 acres (93,000?km2) of land. ÿ Robert V. Remini, Andrew Jackson[35]\\r\\nEventually, the Creek Confederacy enacted a law that made further land cessions a capital offense. Nevertheless, on February 12, 1825, McIntosh and other chiefs signed the Treaty of Indian Springs, which gave up most of the remaining Creek lands in Georgia.[36] After the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty, McIntosh was assassinated on May 13, 1825, by Creeks led by Menawa.\\r\\nThe Creek National Council, led by Opothle Yohola, protested to the United States that the Treaty of Indian Springs was fraudulent. President John Quincy Adams was sympathetic, and eventually the treaty was nullified in a new agreement, the Treaty of Washington (1826).[37] The historian R. Douglas Hurt wrote: \\"The Creeks had accomplished what no Indian nation had ever done or would do again  achieve the annulment of a ratified treaty.\\"[38] However, Governor Troup of Georgia ignored the new treaty and began to forcibly remove the Indians under the terms of the earlier treaty. At first, President Adams attempted to intervene with federal troops, but Troup called out the militia, and Adams, fearful of a civil war, conceded. As he explained to his intimates, \\"The Indians are not worth going to war over.\\"\\r\\nAlthough the Creeks had been forced from Georgia, with many Lower Creeks moving to the Indian Territory, there were still about 20,000 Upper Creeks living in Alabama. However, the state moved to abolish tribal governments and extend state laws over the Creeks. Opothle Yohola appealed to the administration of President Andrew Jackson for protection from Alabama; when none was forthcoming, the Treaty of Cusseta was signed on March 24, 1832, which divided up Creek lands into individual allotments.[39] Creeks could either sell their allotments and receive funds to remove to the west, or stay in Alabama and submit to state laws. The Creeks were never given a fair chance to comply with the terms of the treaty, however. Rampant illegal settlement of their lands by Americans continued unabated with federal and state authorities unable or unwilling to do much to halt it. Further, as recently detailed by historian Billy Winn in his thorough chronicle of the events leading to removal, a variety of fraudulent schemes designed to cheat the Creeks out of their allotments, many of them organized by speculators operating out of Columbus, Georgia and Montgomery, Alabama, were perpetrated after the signing of the Treaty of Cusseta.[40] A portion of the beleaguered Creeks, many desperately poor and feeling abused and oppressed by their American neighbors, struck back by carrying out occasional raids on area farms and committing other isolated acts of violence. Escalating tensions erupted into open war with the United States following the destruction of the village of Roanoke, Georgia, located along the Chattahoochee River on the boundary between Creek and American territory, in May 1836. During the so-called \\"Creek War of 1836\\" Secretary of War Lewis Cass dispatched General Winfield Scott to end the violence by forcibly removing the Creeks to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. With the Indian Removal Act of 1830 it continued into 1835 and after as in 1836 over 15,000 Creeks were driven from their land for the last time. 3,500 of those 15,000 Creeks did not survive the trip to Oklahoma where they eventually settled.[21]\\r\\nThe Chickasaw received financial compensation from the United States for their lands east of the Mississippi River. In 1836, the Chickasaws had reached an agreement to purchase land from the previously removed Choctaws after a bitter five-year debate. They paid the Choctaws $530,000 (equal to $11,810,970 today) for the westernmost part of the Choctaw land. The first group of Chickasaws moved in 1836 and was led by John M. Millard. The Chickasaws gathered at Memphis on July 4, 1836, with all of their assetsbelongings, livestock, and slaves. Once across the Mississippi River, they followed routes previously established by the Choctaws and the Creeks. Once in Indian Territory, the Chickasaws merged with the Choctaw nation.\\r\\nBy 1838, about 2,000 Cherokee had voluntarily relocated from Georgia to Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma). Forcible removals began in May 1838 when General Winfield Scott received a final order from President Martin Van Buren to relocate the remaining Cherokees.[21] Approximately 4,000 Cherokees died in the ensuing trek to Oklahoma.[41] In the Cherokee language, the event is called nu na da ul tsun yi (\\"the place where they cried\\") or nu na hi du na tlo hi lu i (the trail where they cried). The Cherokee Trail of Tears resulted from the enforcement of the Treaty of New Echota, an agreement signed under the provisions of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which exchanged Indian land in the East for lands west of the Mississippi River, but which was never accepted by the elected tribal leadership or a majority of the Cherokee people.[42]\\r\\nThe sparsely inhabited Cherokee lands were highly attractive to Georgian farmers experiencing population pressure, and illegal settlements resulted. Long-simmering tensions between Georgia and the Cherokee Nation were brought to a crisis by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega, Georgia, in 1829, resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush, the second gold rush in U.S. history. Hopeful gold speculators began trespassing on Cherokee lands, and pressure mounted to fulfill the Compact of 1802 in which the US Government promised to extinguish Indian land claims in the state of Georgia.\\r\\nWhen Georgia moved to extend state laws over Cherokee lands in 1830, the matter went to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), the Marshall court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was not a sovereign and independent nation, and therefore refused to hear the case. However, in Worcester v. Georgia (1832), the Court ruled that Georgia could not impose laws in Cherokee territory, since only the national government  not state governments  had authority in Indian affairs. Worcester v Georgia is associated with Andrew Jackson's famous, though apocryphal, quote \\"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\\" In reality, this quote did not appear until 30 years after the incident and was first printed in a textbook authored by Jackson critic Horace Greeley.[17]\\r\\nFearing open warfare between federal troops and the Georgia militia, Jackson decided not to enforce Cherokee claims against the state of Georgia. He was already embroiled in a constitutional crisis with South Carolina (i.e. the nullification crisis) and favored Cherokee relocation over civil war.[17] With the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the U.S. Congress had given Jackson authority to negotiate removal treaties, exchanging Indian land in the East for land west of the Mississippi River. Jackson used the dispute with Georgia to put pressure on the Cherokees to sign a removal treaty.[43]\\r\\nThe final treaty, passed in Congress by a single vote, and signed by President Andrew Jackson, was imposed by his successor President Martin Van Buren. Van Buren allowed Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama an armed force of 7,000 militiamen, army regulars, and volunteers under General Winfield Scott to relocate about 13,000 Cherokees to Cleveland, Tennessee. After the initial roundup, the U.S. military oversaw the emigration to Oklahoma. Former Cherokee lands were immediately opened to settlement. Most of the deaths during the journey were caused by disease, malnutrition, and exposure during an unusually cold winter.[44]\\r\\nIn the winter of 1838 the Cherokee began the 1,000-mile (1,600?km) march with scant clothing and most on foot without shoes or moccasins. The march began in Red Clay, Tennessee, the location of the last Eastern capital of the Cherokee Nation. Because of the diseases, the Indians were not allowed to go into any towns or villages along the way; many times this meant traveling much farther to go around them.[45] After crossing Tennessee and Kentucky, they arrived at the Ohio River across from Golconda in southern Illinois about the 3rd of December 1838. Here the starving Indians were charged a dollar a head (equal to $22.98 today) to cross the river on \\"Berry's Ferry\\" which typically charged twelve cents, equal to $2.76 today. They were not allowed passage until the ferry had serviced all others wishing to cross and were forced to take shelter under \\"Mantle Rock\\", a shelter bluff on the Kentucky side, until \\"Berry had nothing better to do\\". Many died huddled together at Mantle Rock waiting to cross. Several Cherokee were murdered by locals. The Cherokee filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Government through the courthouse in Vienna, suing the government for $35 a head (equal to $804.34 today) to bury the murdered Cherokee.[45]\\r\\nAs they crossed southern Illinois, on December 26, Martin Davis, Commissary Agent for Moses Daniel's detachment, wrote:\\r\\n\\"There is the coldest weather in Illinois I ever experienced anywhere. The streams are all frozen over something like 8 or 12 inches [20 or 30?cm] thick. We are compelled to cut through the ice to get water for ourselves and animals. It snows here every two or three days at the fartherest. We are now camped in Mississippi [River] swamp 4 miles (6?km) from the river, and there is no possible chance of crossing the river for the numerous quantity of ice that comes floating down the river every day. We have only traveled 65 miles (105?km) on the last month, including the time spent at this place, which has been about three weeks. It is unknown when we shall cross the river....\\"[46]\\r\\nA soldier from Georgia said:\\r\\nI fought through the War Between the States and have seen many men shot, but the Cherokee Removal was the cruelest work I ever knew.\\r\\nIt eventually took almost three months to cross the 60 miles (97 kilometres) on land between the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.[48] The trek through southern Illinois is where the Cherokee suffered most of their deaths. However a few years before forced removal, some Cherokee who opted to leave their homes voluntarily chose a water-based route through the Tennessee, Ohio and Mississippi rivers. It took only 21 days, but the Cherokee who were forcibly relocated were weary of water travel.[49]\\r\\nRemoved Cherokees initially settled near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. When signing the Treaty of New Echota in 1835 Major Ridge said \\"I have signed my death warrant.\\" The resulting political turmoil led to the killings of Major Ridge, John Ridge, and Elias Boudinot; of the leaders of the Treaty Party, only Stand Watie escaped death.[50] The population of the Cherokee Nation eventually rebounded, and today the Cherokees are the largest American Indian group in the United States.[51]\\r\\nThere were some exceptions to removal. Approximately 100 Cherokees evaded the U.S. soldiers and lived off the land in Georgia and other states. Those Cherokees who lived on private, individually owned lands (rather than communally owned tribal land) were not subject to removal. In North Carolina, about 400 Cherokees, known as the Oconaluftee Cherokee, lived on land in the Great Smoky Mountains owned by a white man named William Holland Thomas (who had been adopted by Cherokees as a boy), and were thus not subject to removal. Added to this were some 200 Cherokee from the Nantahala area allowed to stay in the Qualla Boundary after assisting the U.S. Army in hunting down and capturing the family of the old prophet, Tsali (who faced a firing squad after capture). These North Carolina Cherokees became the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation.\\r\\nThe United States Court of Claims ruled in favor of the Eastern Cherokee Tribe's claim against the U.S. on May 18, 1905. This resulted in the appropriation of $1 million (equal to $27,438,023.04 today) to the Tribe's eligible individuals and families. Interior Department employee Guion Miller created a list using several rolls and applications to verify tribal enrollment for the distribution of funds, known as the Guion Miller Roll. The applications received documented over 125,000 individuals; the court approved more than 30,000 individuals to share in the funds.[52][page?needed]\\r\\nIn 1987, about 2,200 miles (3,500?km) of trails were authorized by federal law to mark the removal of 17 detachments of the Cherokee people.[53] Called the \\"Trail of Tears National Historic Trail\\", it traverses portions of nine states and includes land and water routes.[54]\\r\\nA historical drama based on the Trail of Tears, Unto These Hills written by Kermit Hunter, has sold over five million tickets for its performances since its opening on July 1, 1950, both touring and at the outdoor Mountainside Theater of the Cherokee Historical Association in Cherokee, North Carolina.[55][56]\\r\\nCherokee artist Troy Anderson was commissioned to design the Cherokee Trail of Tears Sesquicentennial Commemorative Medallion. The falling-tear medallion shows a seven-pointed star, the symbol of the seven clans of the Cherokees.[57]","input":"How many cherokees were on the trail of tears?"},{"output":"May 22, 1902","context":"Crater Lake National Park is a United States National Park located in southern Oregon. Established in 1902, Crater Lake National Park is the fifth-oldest national park in the U.S. and the only national park in Oregon.[3] The park encompasses the caldera of Crater Lake, a remnant of a destroyed volcano, Mount Mazama, and the surrounding hills and forests.\\r\\nThe lake is 1,949 feet (594?m) deep at its deepest point,[4] which makes it the deepest lake in the United States, the second-deepest in North America and the ninth-deepest in the world.[4] Crater Lake is often referred to as the seventh-deepest lake in the world, but this former listing excludes the approximately 3,000-foot (910?m) depth of subglacial Lake Vostok in Antarctica, which resides under nearly 13,000 feet (4,000?m) of ice, and the recent report of a 2,740-foot (840?m) maximum depth for Lake O'Higgins/San Martin, located on the border of Chile and Argentina. However, when comparing its average depth of 1,148 feet (350?m) to the average depth of other deep lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the third-deepest in the world. The impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical 4,000-foot-deep (1,200?m) caldera formed 7,700 years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of Mount Mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the Cascade Range.\\r\\nThe caldera rim ranges in elevation from 7,000 to 8,000 feet (2,100 to 2,400?m). The United States Geological Survey benchmarked elevation of the lake surface itself is 6,178 feet (1,883?m). This National Park encompasses 183,224 acres (74,148?ha; 286.29?sq?mi).[1] Crater Lake has no streams flowing into or out of it. All water that enters the lake is eventually lost from evaporation or subsurface seepage. The lake's water commonly has a striking blue hue, and the lake is re-filled entirely from direct precipitation in the form of snow and rain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVolcanic activity in this area is fed by subduction off the coast of Oregon as the Juan de Fuca Plate slips below the North American Plate (see plate tectonics). Heat and compression generated by this movement has created a mountain chain topped by a series of volcanoes, which together are called the Cascade Range. The large volcanoes in the range are called the High Cascades. However, there are many other volcanoes in the range as well, most of which are much smaller.\\r\\nAbout 400,000 years ago, Mount Mazama began its existence in much the same way as the other mountains of the High Cascades, as overlapping shield volcanoes. Over time, alternating layers of lava flows and pyroclastic flows built Mazama's overlapping cones until it reached about 11,000 feet (3,400?m) in height.\\r\\nAs the young stratovolcano grew, many smaller volcanoes and volcanic vents were built in the area of the park and just outside what are now the park's borders. Chief among these were cinder cones. Although the early examples are gonecinder cones erode easilythere are at least 13 much younger cinder cones in the park, and at least another 11 or so outside its borders, that still retain their distinctive cinder cone appearance. There continues to be debate as to whether these minor volcanoes and vents were parasitic to Mazama's magma chamber and system or if they were related to background Oregon Cascade volcanism.\\r\\nAfter a period of dormancy, Mazama became active again. Then, around 5700 BC, Mazama collapsed into itself during a tremendous volcanic eruption, losing 2,500 to 3,500 feet (760 to 1,070?m) in height. The eruption formed a large caldera that, depending on the prevailing climate, was filled in about 740 years, forming a beautiful lake with a deep blue hue, known today as Crater Lake.[5]\\r\\nThe eruptive period that decapitated Mazama also laid waste to much of the greater Crater Lake area and deposited ash as far east as the northwest corner of what is now Yellowstone National Park, as far south as central Nevada, and as far north as southern British Columbia. It produced more than 150 times as much ash as the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.\\r\\nThis ash has since developed a soil type called andisol. Soils in Crater Lake National Park are brown, dark brown or dark grayish-brown sandy loams or loamy sands which have plentiful cobbles, gravel and stones. They are slightly to moderately acidic and their drainage is somewhat excessive.\\r\\nSnow is relatively rare at low elevations in western Oregon, but it is common at higher elevations, especially at Crater Lake. Measurements at park headquarters, 6,475 feet (1,974?m) above sea level, show that snow falls more often here than at any other long-term weather station in Oregon. Winter, which typically begins at the park in September and runs through June, includes an average of 98 days with measurable snowfall. Up to 37 inches (94?cm) of snow have fallen on the park in a single day (in 1937, 1951, and 1971), 313 inches (800?cm) in a month (January 1950), and 903 inches (2,290?cm) in a year (1950).[6]\\r\\nSnow typically accumulates in the park to depths of 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6?m) by early spring. Most of the park's roads remain closed through late spring, and snow lingers into the summer. In July and August, snowfall is uncommon, and \\"one magnificent day typically follows another\\".[7]\\r\\nJanuary is the coldest month, when highs average about 35?F (2?C) and lows average about 18?F (?8?C).[8] August is the warmest month, with an average high of roughly 69?F (21?C) and an average low of about 40?F (4?C).[8] Between 1962 and 1990, the highest recorded temperature was 90?F (32?C), and the lowest was ?21?F (?29?C).[9] Annual precipitation averages about 66 inches (1,700?mm) a year.[10] December is the wettest, averaging about 11 inches (280?mm).[10]\\r\\nAlthough snow covers Crater Lake National Park for eight months of the year (average annual snowfall is 533 inches (1,350?cm)), the lake rarely freezes over due in part to a relatively mild onshore flow from the Pacific Ocean. The last recorded year in which the lake froze over was in 1949, a very long, cold winter. A 95% surface freeze occurred in 1985. The immense depth of Crater Lake acts as a heat reservoir that absorbs and traps sunlight, maintaining the lake temperature at an average of 55?F (13?C) on the surface and 38?F (3?C) at the bottom throughout the year. The surface temperature fluctuates a bit, but the bottom temperature remains quite constant.\\r\\nMammals that are residents of this national park are Canadian lynxes, bobcats, beavers, chipmunks, pikas, foxes, cougars, squirrels, porcupines, black bears, coyotes, timber wolves, badgers, deer, elk, muskrats, and martens. Birds that commonly fly through this park including raptors are American dippers, Peregrine falcons, ravens, Clark's nutcrackers, gray jays, bald eagles, hummingbirds and spotted owls while Canada geese float on its lake.\\r\\nSome notable park features created by this huge eruption are:\\r\\nLocal Native Americans witnessed the collapse of Mount Mazama and kept the event alive in their legends. One ancient legend of the Klamath people closely parallels the geologic story which emerges from today's scientific research. The legend tells of two Chiefs, Llao of the Below World and Skell of the Above World, pitted in a battle which ended up in the destruction of Llao's home, Mt. Mazama.[14] The battle was witnessed in the eruption of Mt. Mazama and the creation of Crater Lake.\\r\\nA trio of gold prospectors: John Wesley Hillman, Henry Klippel, and Isaac Skeeters were the first white people to visit the lake. On June 12, 1853, they stumbled upon the long, sloping mountain while hunting for provisions. Stunned by vibrant blue color of the lake, they named the indigo body of water \\"Deep Blue Lake\\" and the place on the southwest side of the rim where he first saw the lake later became known as Discovery Point.[3] But gold was more on the minds of settlers at the time and the discovery was soon forgotten. The suggested name later fell out of favor by locals, who preferred the name Crater Lake.\\r\\nWilliam Gladstone Steel devoted his life and fortune to the establishment and management of a national park at Crater Lake. His preoccupation with the lake began in 1870. In his efforts to bring recognition to the park, he participated in lake surveys that provided scientific support. He named many of the lake's landmarks, including Wizard Island, Llao Rock, and Skell Head.\\r\\nWith the help of geologist Clarence Dutton, Steel organized a USGS expedition to study the lake in 1886. The party carried the Cleetwood, a half-ton survey boat, up the steep slopes of the mountain then lowered it to the lake. From the stern of the Cleetwood, a piece of pipe on the end of a spool of piano wire sounded the depth of the lake at 168 different points. Their deepest sounding, 1,996 feet (608?m), was very close to the modern official depth of 1,949 feet (594?m) made in 2000 by sonar.[4] At the same time, a topographer surveyed the area and created the first professional map of the Crater Lake area.\\r\\nPartly based on data from the expedition and lobbying from Steel and others, Crater Lake National Park was established May 22, 1902 by President Theodore Roosevelt. And because of Steel's involvement, Crater Lake Lodge was opened in 1915 and the Rim Drive was completed in 1918.[3]\\r\\nHighways were later built to the park to help facilitate tourism. The 1929 edition of O Ranger! described access and facilities available by then:\\r\\nCrater Lake National Park is reached by train on the Southern Pacific Railroad lines into Medford and Klamath Falls, at which stops motor stages make the short trip to the park. A hotel on the rim of the lake offers accommodations. For the motorist, the visit to the park is a short side trip from the Pacific and Dalles-California highways. He will find, in addition to the hotel, campsites, stores, filling stations. The park is open to travel from late June or July 1 for as long as snow does not block the roads, generally until October.[15]\\r\\nThe lake is described in the poetry of Joaquin Miller.[16]\\r\\nThere are many hiking trails and several campgrounds inside the park. Unlicensed fishing is allowed without any limitation of size, species, or number. The lake is believed to have no indigenous fish, but several species of fish were introduced beginning in 1888 until all fish stocking ended in 1941. Kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) now thrive and reproduce here naturally.[17] Swimming is allowed in the lake, and the boat tours, which stop at Wizard Island, a cinder cone inside the lake, operate daily during the summer. All lake access for people is from Cleetwood Trail, a steep walking trail, and there are no roads for cars, trucks, or wagons that lead to the waterfront. All of the boats in the lake were delivered by helicopter.[18]\\r\\nNumerous observation points along the caldera rim for the lake are readily accessible by automobile via the \\"Rim Drive\\", which is 33 miles (53?km) long and has an elevation gain of 3,800 feet (1,200?m).\\r\\nThe highest point in Crater Lake National Park is Mount Scott at 8,929 feet (2,722?m). Getting there requires a fairly steep 2.5-mile (4.0?km) hike from the Rim Drive trailhead. On a clear day, visibility from the summit exceeds 100 miles (160?km), and one can, in a single view, take in the entire caldera. Also visible from this point are the white-peaked Cascade Range volcanoes to the north, the Columbia River Plateau to the east, and the Western Cascades and the more-distant Klamath Mountains to the west.\\r\\nThe scenery of Crater Lake is fully accessible during the summer months. Heavy snowfalls in this park during the fall, winter, and spring months force many road and trail closures, including the popular \\"Rim Drive\\", which is generally completely open from July to October and partially open in some other months, such as May, June, and November.\\r\\nThe Cleetwood Cove trail originates on the north side of the lake about 4.5?mi (7.2?km) east of North Junction along East Rim Drive. The trail is the only one that accesses the shoreline of the lake, descending 656 feet (200?m) from the Cleetwood Cove parking lot. First opened during the summer of 1960, the trail is 1.1?mi (1.8?km) long with an 11% grade that rates it as a strenuous route on the return trip. Due to its steep grade, the trail is not accessible for mobility-impaired visitors. A dock with concessionaire boats facilitates tours around the lake with a stop at Wizard Island for dropping off and picking up passengers. Swimming and fishing are permitted. Snow may cover the trail from October to July with some variance depending on yearly snowfall conditions.[19]\\r\\nThe Watchman Peak trail begins from the Watchman Overlook parking lot, about 3.8?mi (6.1?km) northwest of Rim Village.[20] The trail is 0.8?mi (1.3?km) long with a 420-foot (130?m) elevation change.[21] It is a steady uphill trail on an isolated mountain on the west rim of the crater, with several switchbacks, providing wide views of Crater Lake and Wizard Island. Several nearby landmarks are visible from the summit, including Mount McLoughlin, Mount Thielsen, Union Peak, Mount Scott and the Klamath Basin. The trail ends next to a historic fire lookout tower built in 1932.[20]\\r\\nThe Lightning Spring trail starts from the Lightning Spring picnic area. It is a 3?4-mile (1.2?km) hike with an elevation gain of 250 feet (76?m). The trail circles around several meadows up to the Lightning Spring creek. The trail is known for the frequent sights of grazing deer.\\r\\nThis is considered to be the easiest trail, looping around the Castle Crest Wildflower Garden. It starts from the East Rim Road, near the park's headquarters. It received its name because of a large stretch of meadows around which the trail circles and which is bursting with wildflowers in the springtime. The trail is about 1?2 mile (800?m) before it reaches the wildflower meadow garden, from which other improvised routes depart.\\r\\nThe Plaikni Falls trail is the newest trail on the Crater Lake park. It stretches 1.1 miles (1.8?km) from the trailhead located 1.2 miles (1.9?km) south from the Phantom Ship Overlook on Pinnacles Road, which spins off Rim Drive. The trail leads to Plaikni Falls. Most of the trail is wheelchair-accessible. The final stretch is fairly uphill, which may prove moderately challenging.\\r\\nThe Garfield Peak trail is a moderately challenging 1.7-mile (2.7?km) hike to Garfield Peak. The trailhead is located east of the Crater Lake Lodge and gains approximately 1,000 feet (300?m) of elevation. Several spots along the trail provide viewpoints overlooking the Phantom Ship island and Dutton Cliff. A few viewpoints offer unique views of Wizard island. The trail is popular in the late afternoon on account of unique shifting colors over the lake and its surroundings.","input":"When did crater lake became a national park?"},{"output":"a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)","context":"In computing, a Digital Object Identifier or DOI is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).[1] An implementation of the Handle System,[2][3] DOIs are in wide use mainly to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports and data sets, and official publications though they also have been used to identify other types of information resources, such as commercial videos.\\r\\nA DOI aims to be \\"resolvable\\", usually to some form of access to the information object to which the DOI refers. This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL, indicating where the object can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from identifiers such as ISBNs and ISRCs which aim only to uniquely identify their referents. The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model for representing metadata.\\r\\nThe DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI shall provide a more stable linking than simply using its URL. Every time a URL changes, the publisher has to update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL.[4][5][6] It is the publisher's responsibility to update the DOI database. By failing to do so, the DOI resolves to a dead link leaving the DOI useless.\\r\\nThe developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation (IDF), which introduced it in 2000.[7] Organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the DOI system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign DOIs.[8] The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the IDF.[9] By late April 2011 more than 50 million DOI names had been assigned by some 4,000 organizations,[10] and by April 2013 this number had grown to 85 million DOI names assigned through 9,500 organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA DOI is a type of Handle System handle, which takes the form of a character string divided into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, separated by a slash.\\r\\nThe prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier, and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI. Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. The prefix usually takes the form 10.NNNN, where NNNN is a series of at least 4 numbers greater than or equal to 1000, whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants.[11][12] The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like 10.NNNN.N.[13]\\r\\nFor example, in the DOI name 10.1000/182, the prefix is 10.1000 and the suffix is 182. The \\"10.\\" part of the prefix distinguishes the handle as part of the DOI namespace, as opposed to some other Handle System namespace,[A] and the characters 1000 in the prefix identify the registrant; in this case the registrant is the International DOI Foundation itself. 182 is the suffix, or item ID, identifying a single object (in this case, the latest version of the DOI Handbook).\\r\\nDOI names can identify creative works (such as texts, images, audio or video items, and software) in both electronic and physical forms, performances, and abstract works[14] such as licenses, parties to a transaction, etc.\\r\\nThe names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail: thus DOI names can identify a journal, an individual issue of a journal, an individual article in the journal, or a single table in that article. The choice of level of detail is left to the assigner, but in the DOI system it must be declared as part of the metadata that is associated with a DOI name, using a data dictionary based on the indecs Content Model.\\r\\nThe official DOI Handbook explicitly states that DOIs should display on screens and in print in the format doi:10.1000/182.[15]\\r\\nContrary to the DOI Handbook, CrossRef, a major DOI registration agency, recommends displaying a URL (for example, https://doi.org/10.1000/182) instead of the officially specified format (for example, doi:10.1000/182)[16][17] This URL is persistent (there is a contract that ensures persistence in the DOI.ORG domain), so it is a PURL  providing the location of an HTTP proxy server which will redirect web accesses to the correct online location of the linked item.[8][18]\\r\\nThe CrossRef recommendation is primarily based on the assumption that the DOI is being displayed without being hyper-linked to its appropriate URL ÿ the argument being that without the hyperlink it is not as easy to copy-and-paste the full URL to actually bring up the page for the DOI, thus the entire URL should be displayed, allowing people viewing the page containing the DOI to copy-and-paste the URL, by hand, into a new window/tab in their browser in order to go to the appropriate page for the document the DOI represents.\\r\\nMajor applications of the DOI system currently include:\\r\\nIn the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's publication service OECD iLibrary, each table or graph in an OECD publication is shown with a DOI name that leads to an Excel file of data underlying the tables and graphs. Further development of such services is planned.[19]\\r\\nOther registries include Crossref and the multilingual European DOI Registration Agency.[20] Since 2015 RFCs can be referenced as doi:10.17487/rfc.[21]\\r\\nThe IDF designed the DOI system to provide a form of persistent identification, in which each DOI name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated. It also associates metadata with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the Handle System and the indecs Content Model with a social infrastructure.\\r\\nThe Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the URI specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on open architectures, incorporates trust mechanisms, and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.[22] DOI name-resolution may be used with OpenURL to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.[23] However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.[24]\\r\\nThe indecs Content Model as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.\\r\\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF) oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure. The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as GS1 and ISBN.\\r\\nA DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material, such as the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a first-class entity, rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the Uniform Resource Identifier (Uniform Resource Name) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.[25]\\r\\nA DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the ISBN, ISRC, etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.[26]\\r\\nThe DOI system offers persistent, semantically-interoperable resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as \\"identifiers\\" doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other \\"identifier systems\\" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL), URLs, Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., ARK).\\r\\nA DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a Uniform Resource Name (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet (better characterised as Uniform Resource Identifiers) although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.\\r\\nDOI name resolution is provided through the Handle System, developed by Corporation for National Research Initiatives, and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its <type> field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.\\r\\nTo resolve a DOI name, it may be input to a DOI resolver, such as doi.org.\\r\\nAnother approach, which avoids typing or cutting-and-pasting into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as http://doi.org/ (preferred)[27] or http://dx.doi.org/, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI 10.1000/182 can be included in a reference or hyperlink as https://doi.org/10.1000/182. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal hyperlink. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.\\r\\nOther DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include http://hdl.handle.net, http://doi.medra.org, https://doi.pangaea.de/. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a non-paywalled version of a title and redirects you to that instead of the publisher's version.[28][29] Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016.[30] While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).[28][30]\\r\\nAn alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for browsers, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs,[31] which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the CNRI Handle Extension for Firefox, enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like hdl:4263537/4000 or doi:10.1000/1 directly in the Firefox browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, mail reader, or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.\\r\\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF), a non-profit organisation created in 1998, is the governance body of the DOI system.[32] It safeguards all intellectual property rights relating to the DOI system, manages common operational features, and supports the development and promotion of the DOI system. The IDF ensures that any improvements made to the DOI system (including creation, maintenance, registration, resolution and policymaking of DOI names) are available to any DOI registrant. It also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the IDF on users of the DOI system.\\r\\nThe IDF is controlled by a Board elected by the members of the Foundation, with an appointed Managing Agent who is responsible for co-ordinating and planning its activities.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's Division I Basketball Championship, or NCAA Tournament, is a single-elimination tournament for men's college basketball teams in the United States. It determines the champion of Division I, the top level of play in the NCAA,[1] and the media often describes the winner as the national champion of college basketball.[2][3] The NCAA Tournament has been held annually since 1939, and its field grew from eight teams in the beginning to sixty-five teams by 2001; as of 2011, sixty-eight teams take part in the tournament.[4][5] Teams can gain invitations by winning a conference championship or receiving an at-large bid from a 10-person committee.[6] The semifinals of the tournament are known as the Final Four and are held in a different city each year, along with the championship game;[7] Indianapolis, the city where the NCAA is based, will host the Final Four every five years until 2040.[8] Each winning university receives a rectangular, gold-plated trophy made of wood.[9]\\r\\nThe first NCAA Tournament was organized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches.[10] Oregon won the inaugural tournament, defeating Ohio State 46ÿ33 in the first championship game. Before the 1941 tournament, control of the event was given to the NCAA.[10] In the early years of the tournament, it was considered less important than the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), a New York City-based event.[11][12] Teams were able to compete in both events in the same year, and three of those that did soUtah in 1944, Kentucky in 1949, and City College of New York (CCNY) in 1950won the NCAA Tournament.[13] The 1949ÿ50 CCNY team won both tournaments (defeating Bradley in both finals), and is the only college basketball team to accomplish this feat.[14] By the mid-1950s, the NCAA Tournament became the more prestigious of the two events,[15] and in 1971 the NCAA barred universities from playing in other tournaments, such as the NIT, if they were invited to the NCAA Tournament.[16]\\r\\nThe University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has been the most successful college in the NCAA Tournament, winning 11 national titles. Ten of those championships came during a 12-year stretch from 1964 to 1975. UCLA also holds the record for the most consecutive championships, winning seven in a row from 1967 to 1973. Kentucky has the second-most titles, with eight. North Carolina is third with six championships, while Duke and Indiana follow with five each. Villanova is the most recent champion, having defeated Michigan in the final of the 2018 tournament. Among head coaches, John Wooden is the all-time leader with 10 championships; he coached UCLA during their period of success in the 1960s and 1970s.

The series was adapted for The CW by Archie Comics' chief creative officer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, and is produced by Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions and Archie Comics. Originally conceived as a feature film adaptation for Warner Bros. Pictures, the idea was re-imagined as a television series for Fox. In 2015, development on the project moved to The CW, where the series was ordered for a pilot. Filming takes place in Vancouver, British Columbia.\\r\\nThe series features an ensemble cast based on the characters of Archie Comics, with KJ Apa in the role of Archie Andrews; Lili Reinhart as Betty Cooper, Camila Mendes as Veronica Lodge, and Cole Sprouse as Jughead Jones, the series' narrator. The cast also features Madelaine Petsch as Cheryl Blossom, Ashleigh Murray as Josie McCoy and Casey Cott as Kevin Keller. Other characters in the series include the parents of the main characters: Luke Perry as Fred Andrews, M?dchen Amick as Alice Cooper, Marisol Nichols and Mark Consuelos as Hermione and Hiram Lodge, and Skeet Ulrich as FP Jones.\\r\\nThe series debuted on January 26, 2017 to positive reviews. A 22-episode second season premiered on October 11, 2017, and concluded on May 16, 2018. On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a third season.\\r\\nThe series follows Archie Andrews' life in the small town of Riverdale and explores the darkness hidden behind its seemingly perfect image.[1]\\r\\nWarner Bros. began development on an Archie feature film in 2013, after a pitch from writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and director Jason Moore that would place Archie's gang into a teen comedy feature film in the John Hughes tradition.[50] The duo brought the project to Warner Bros., where a VP recommended a more high-concept direction involving time travel or interdimensional portals, suggesting Louis C. K. to portray an older Archie.[51] Dan Lin and Roy Lee became producers on the project, which eventually stalled as priorities shifted at the studio towards larger tentpole films and was reimagined as a television series.[50] Riverdale was originally in development at Fox, with the network landing the project in 2014 with a script deal plus penalty.[52] However, Fox did not go forward with the project. In 2015, the show's development was moved to The CW,[53] which officially ordered a pilot on January 29, 2016.[54] On March 7, 2017, The CW announced that the series had been renewed for a second season.[55] On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a third season.[56]\\r\\nCasting Archie was a difficult process, with Aguirre-Sacasa stating \\"I think we literally saw every redheaded young guy in L.A.

In the series, he and Hermione are friends. He previously offered her a role as a cast member on The Real Housewives of New York City; however, Hermione turned down the offer to keep things private for the Lodge family.[65]\\r\\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Charles Melton and Vanessa Morgan, who play Reggie Mantle and Toni Topaz, respectively, would both be promoted to series regulars in the third season.[66]\\r\\nFilming of the pilot began on March 14, 2016, and ended on April 1 in Vancouver, British Columbia.[67][68] Production on the remaining 12 episodes of season one began on September 7, 2016, in Vancouver.[69] Sets include Pop Tate's Chock'lit Shoppe, a copy of the functioning diner used in the pilot that is so realistic a truck driver parked his 18-wheeler there, believing that it was open.[70] Season two was also filmed in Vancouver and the nearby Fraser Valley.[71] The aerial view of Riverdale is actually drawn from stock footage used in the series Pretty Little Liars, Gilmore Girls, and the landmark setting are the same utilized in both of the aforementioned series as well as in Hart of Dixie.[72] Filming for the second season started on June 22, 2017,[73] and concluded on March 27, 2018.[74]\\r\\nSeveral reviewers had noted that the series' episode titles, are often taken directly or slightly altered from the titles of older films.[75][76] For example, De Elizabeth of TeenVogue points out that Riverdale's pilot episode was named \\"River's Edge\\" after the 1986 film of the same name, and the season finale also takes its name from 1997's The Sweet Hereafter.[77] Executive producer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa notes that this is a deliberate choice, in order to hint at what will happen in that episode.[77]\\r\\nAdditionally, Katie-Kouise Smith, of Popbuzz, notes that the opening credits for Riverdale mirror those of the Twin Peaks television series, and are intended as an homage to that series' creator, David Lynch.[72]\\r\\nMusical performances are featured throughout the series, a blend of cover versions and originals.

The comic book adaptation is being headed by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa himself, along with various other writers from the show. Alongside a one-shot pilot issue, illustrated by Alitha Martinez, released in March 2017,[96] the first issue of the ongoing Riverdale comic book series was set to release starting April 2017.[97]\\r\\nIn addition to the adaptation, Archie Comics are releasing a series of compilation graphic novels branded under the title Road to Riverdale. This series features early issues from the New Riverdale reboot line, introducing the audience of the TV series to the regular ongoing comic series that inspired it. Archie Comics plans to re-print the volumes of Road to Riverdale in subsequent months as digest magazines. The first volume was released in March 2017.[97]\\r\\nThe first season of Riverdale has received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a fresh rating of 88% based on 54 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.27/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Riverdale offers an amusingly self-aware reimagining of its classic source material that proves eerie, odd, daring, and above all addictive.\\"[98] On Metacritic, the season has a score of 68 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[99] Dave Nemetz of TVLine gave the series a \\"B+\\" saying that it turned, \\"out to be an artfully crafted, instantly engaging teen soap with loads of potential.\\"[100]\\r\\nSome writers have criticized the series for its handling of minority characters. While reviewing the first season, Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle declared \\"the show marginalizes and ignores the [people of color] in the cast to the point where they may as well not be there.\\"[101] In an article for Vulture, Angelica Jade Bastien discussed the show's treatment of Josie and the Pussycats (who are each played by African Americans), noting, \\"They're not characters so much as they are a vehicle for a Message. Josie and her fellow pussycats are positioned to communicate the message that Riverdale is more modern and inclusive than teen dramas of the past, even though it has yet to prove it beyond its casting.\\"[102] Monique Jones of Ebony noted, \\"Despite the show's multi-racial casting choices, it seems like Riverdale is still a mostly white town.\\" She also expressed fondness for the relationship between Archie Andrews and Valerie Brown, but declared \\"Archie shouldn't be what makes Valerie interesting to us\\".[103]\\r\\nIn September 2017, it was reported that a live-action television series was being developed for The CW by Warner Bros. Television and Berlanti Productions, with a planned release in the 2018ÿ2019 television season. Based on the comic series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, featuring the Archie Comics character Sabrina the Teenage Witch, the series would be a companion series to Riverdale. Lee Toland Krieger will direct the pilot, which will be written by Aguirre-Sacasa. Both are executive producers along with Berlanti, Schechter, and Goldwater.[144] In December 2017, it was reported that the project had moved to Netflix under a yet-to-be-announced new title. Two seasons, comprising ten episodes each, have been ordered by the streaming service.[145] In January 2018, it was announced that the lead role of Sabrina Spellman would be portrayed by Kiernan Shipka,[146] and CW president Mark Pedowitz noted that, \\"at the moment, there is no discussion about crossing over\\" with Riverdale.[147] Filming for first season began on March 19, 2018, just as filming of the second season of Riverdale concludes, which will allow the same crew members to work on both series.[148] It is expected to film back-to-back with the second season.[149]","input":"What is the tv show riverdale based off of?"},{"output":"defensive back","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nNicholas Lou Saban Jr. (/se?b?n/; born October 31, 1951)[3] is an American football coach who has been the head football coach at the University of Alabama since 2007. Saban previously served as head coach of the National Football League's Miami Dolphins and at three other universities: Louisiana State University (LSU), Michigan State University, and the University of Toledo. Saban's career record as a college head coach is 226-62ÿ1.[n 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaban led the LSU Tigers to the BCS National Championship in 2003 and the Alabama Crimson Tide to BCS and AP national championships in 2009, 2011, 2012, and College Football Playoff championships in 2015 and 2017. He became the first coach in college football history to win a national championship with two different Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) schools since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936.[4] Saban and Bear Bryant are the only coaches to win an SEC championship at two different schools.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, Saban was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.[6] Saban has been considered by many as the greatest coach in college football history.[7][8][9] He is tied with Bryant for most major college football national championships for a coach in the modern era.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaban was born in Fairmont, West Virginia, to Mary and Nick Lou Saban Sr. He grew up and graduated from Monongah High School[11] in the small community of Monongah, West Virginia, about 90?miles south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On December?18, 1971, he married Terry Constable, who was also from West Virginia. In 1973, Saban graduated from Kent State University with a bachelor's degree in business. In 1975, he earned his master's degree in sports administration from Kent State.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaban played defensive back for Kent State under coach Don James. He and a roommate avoided being part of the Kent State shootings when they decided to eat lunch before walking to the rally area.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaban had not intended to enter the coaching ranks until Don James hired him as a graduate assistant at Kent State, while Saban waited for his wife to graduate.[14] He later served as an assistant coach in NCAA Division I-A, at several schools: Syracuse in 1977, West Virginia in 1978 and 1979, Ohio State in 1980 and 1981, Navy in 1982, and Michigan State from 1983 to 1987.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 1987 season, Kent State passed over Saban for its vacant head coaching position and hired Dick Crum.[16] Saban was then hired as an assistant for the Houston Oilers in the National Football League.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaban began his career as a head coach when he was hired by the University of Toledo on December 22, 1989.[17] Coming off of 6ÿ5 seasons in both 1988 and 1989, the Rockets found quick success under Nick Saban in 1990. With a 9ÿ2 season, Toledo was co-champion of the Mid-American Conference.  The two games the Rockets lost that season were by narrow margins: one point to Central Michigan and four points to Navy.[18] While coaching in Toledo, Saban turned down an application from future head coach Urban Meyer, who was looking for any coaching job on Saban's staff.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following February, Saban resigned as Toledo's head coach after only  one season in order to become defensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns under head coach Bill Belichick.[20] He remained in that position for four seasons. Saban later said these four years were the \\"worst of my life\\".[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaban arrived in East Lansing, Michigan prior to the 1995 season. Michigan State had not had a winning season since 1990, and the team was sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations that were committed under his predecessor and former mentor, George Perles.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 1995, Saban moderately improved Michigan State's fortunes, taking the Spartans to bowl games in each of his first three seasons. From 1995 to 1997, Michigan State finished 6ÿ5ÿ1, 6ÿ6, and 7ÿ5. In comparison, MSU had finished 5ÿ6, 6ÿ6, and 5ÿ6 (prior to NCAA forfeits) in 1992ÿ1994.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 7, 1998, the Spartans upset the No.?1 ranked Ohio State 28ÿ24 at Ohio Stadium. However, even after the upset and an early-season rout of then-highly ranked Notre Dame the Spartans finished 6ÿ6, including three last-minute losses featuring turnovers, defensive lapses, and special-teams misplays, and failed to earn a bowl invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaban led the 1999 Spartans to a 9ÿ2 season that included wins over Notre Dame, Michigan, Ohio State, and Penn State. However, the two losses were routs at the hands of Purdue and Wisconsin. Following the final regular-season game against Penn State, Saban abruptly resigned to accept the head coaching position with LSU. Saban's assistant head coach and successor, Bobby Williams, then coached the Spartans to a Citrus Bowl victory over Florida, giving the Spartans an overall record of 10ÿ2 for the 1999 season. It would be the best season in terms of wins for the Spartans since 1965, and it would see the Spartans reach their highest ranking since the 1966 team.[23] Future NFL head coach Josh McDaniels served as a graduate assistant on Saban's 1999 coaching staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1999, LSU named Nick Saban as their 31st head football coach.[24] In 2000, the Tigers went 8ÿ4 and won the Peach Bowl. The season was somewhat marred by several lopsided losses, including a 34ÿ17 loss to the Auburn Tigers, a 13ÿ10 loss to the UAB Blazers, and a 41ÿ9 loss to the Florida Gators.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaban led LSU to a 10ÿ3 record in 2001, including an SEC Championship and a Sugar Bowl victory. After a loss to the Ole Miss Rebels, the Tigers finished the year with six straight wins, including a win over #2 Tennessee in the 2001 SEC Championship Game, and a 47ÿ34 win over Illinois in the 2002 Sugar Bowl. It was the first outright SEC championship for LSU since 1986, and the first time the Tigers had won the Sugar Bowl since 1968.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2002 season opened with high expectations, but a 26ÿ8 loss at the hands of Virginia Tech raised serious questions about their outlook. However, the Tigers would rebound to win their next six straight, but after a mid-season injury to quarterback Matt Mauck, LSU lost four of its last six games to close the season, including a 21ÿ20 loss at Arkansas, which knocked the Tigers out of the SEC Championship Game, and forced them to share the SEC West Division title with the Razorbacks. LSU also suffered a 35ÿ20 loss to Texas in the Cotton Bowl Classic, and finished 8ÿ5.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2003 Tigers started the season with five wins, including a 17ÿ10 victory in Tiger Stadium over the defending SEC champion, and then undefeated, Georgia Bulldogs. LSU lost the following week to Florida, 19ÿ7. After the loss to Florida, LSU did not lose again in the regular season and ended its regular season with a win over the Arkansas Razorbacks to win the SEC West. After winning the SEC West, the Tigers defeated the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship Game in Atlanta. They were ranked No.?2 in the BCS standings and advanced to play the BCS No.?1 Oklahoma Sooners in the Sugar Bowl, which was the host of the BCS Championship Game in 2003. The Tigers won the game 21ÿ14. The win gave LSU the BCS national championship[25] and a 13ÿ1 finish for the season.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nLSU finished the 2004 season 9ÿ3, after losing to the Iowa Hawkeyes in the Capital One Bowl 30ÿ25 on a final play touchdown pass. Other losses that season were on the road at Auburn 10ÿ9, and a loss on the road to Georgia 45ÿ16. At the end of the 2004 season, Saban left LSU to coach the Miami Dolphins.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaban accepted the head coaching position for the Miami Dolphins on December 25, 2004. He was the sixth coach in the franchise's history. The Nick Saban era officially kicked off with a 34ÿ10 win over the Denver Broncos in 2005. From there, however, the Dolphins struggled, losing seven of their next nine games to fall to 3ÿ7. The two wins came over the Carolina Panthers and the New Orleans Saints, a game that took place in Tiger Stadium due to Hurricane Katrina. After a frustrating two months, however, the Dolphins would rally late in the season, as they won their final six games, including a win to end the season in Foxboro, Massachusetts over the New England Patriots. The team finished the year with a 9ÿ7 record, and narrowly missed the playoffs in Saban's first season.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing into the 2006 season, the Dolphins were expected to contend for a playoff spot. The season, however, turned out to be a major disappointment. The Dolphins were considering quarterback Drew Brees, who had just been released from the San Diego Chargers due to a career-threatening shoulder injury and subsequent contract dispute, but instead signed Daunte Culpepper, who was still recovering from a knee injury from the previous season. Culpepper never fully recovered and was ultimately benched after the fourth game of the season, when the Dolphins lost to the Houston Texans. He was eventually put on Injured Reserve. After starting the season 1ÿ6, however, the Dolphins got hot. They won four straight games, including wins over the Chicago Bears, who were previously unbeaten and made it to the Super Bowl that year, and the Kansas City Chiefs. Suddenly, the Dolphins were back in the playoff hunt at 5ÿ6, but a 24ÿ10 loss the following week to the Jacksonville Jaguars all but ended their playoff hopes. The Dolphins would rebound the following week with a 21ÿ0 win over the New England Patriots. The win would be the last bright spot for the Dolphins in the 2006 season. Quarterback Joey Harrington was eventually benched in favor of third-string quarterback Cleo Lemon. While the defense was very good, the offense was anemic, with the only bright spot being running back Ronnie Brown, who gained over 1,000 rushing yards on the season. The Dolphins would lose their next two games to the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets to finish 6ÿ10, Saban's first losing season as a head coach.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 27, 2006, the University of Alabama announced the firing of head coach Mike Shula. Saban was rumored to be at the top of Alabama's wish list, but Saban refused to discuss the job while his NFL season was still underway.[27] During the month of December 2006, Saban was repeatedly questioned by the media about the Alabama job, and he repeatedly denied the rumors in his weekly press conferences, stating on December?21 \\"I guess I have to say it. I'm not going to be the Alabama coach.\\"[28][29] Saban met with Alabama officials on January 1, 2007,[30] which was shortly after the Dolphins' season ending loss to the Indianapolis Colts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January?3, 2007, following a meeting with Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga, Saban announced that he had accepted an offer to become Alabama's 27th?head coach.[31] His initial eight-year contract totaling US$32?million made him one of the highest-paid football coaches,[32] professional or collegiate, in the United States at the time.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January?4, 2007, at a press conference on the Alabama campus, Saban was officially introduced as the head football coach of The University of Alabama. On September?1, 2007, his Crimson Tide opened the season with a 52ÿ6 win over the Western Carolina Catamounts, scoring more points than during any game in the 2006 season. Saban became the fifth Alabama coach since 1900 to start his first season 3ÿ0, earning a win over then-ranked No.?16 Arkansas Razorbacks.[34] Alabama ended the regular season with a 6ÿ6 record, including a four-game losing streak, a particularly humiliating loss at home to Louisiana-Monroe, and a sixth straight loss to Auburn in the Iron Bowl. The Crimson Tide defeated Colorado in the 2007 Independence Bowl, 30ÿ24, to end the year 7ÿ6.[n 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his second year as head coach of the Tide, Saban led his team from a sub-par season in 2007 to a perfect 12ÿ0 regular season record. Saban finished the regular season undefeated for the first time in his career as a head coach as he led the Crimson Tide to its first undefeated regular season since 1994.  He appeared on the September 1, 2008, cover of Forbes magazine as \\"The Most Powerful Coach in Sports\\".[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis second season at the Capstone began with a 34ÿ10 victory over the No.?9 ranked Clemson Tigers in the Chick-fil-A College Kickoff in the Georgia Dome. Three weeks later Alabama had a convincing 49ÿ14 road-win over Arkansas. The Tide followed that victory with an impressive 41ÿ30 win over the No.?3 ranked Georgia Bulldogs. After the Georgia game, the Tide won consecutive home games against the Kentucky Wildcats and the Ole Miss Rebels and finished the month of October with a 29ÿ9 victory over the Tennessee Volunteers in Knoxville. Following a 35ÿ0 homecoming victory over Arkansas State, the Crimson Tide rose to No.?1 in all major polls in Week 10??following a loss by No.?1 Texas to the Texas Tech Red Raiders. It was the first time since the 1980 season that Alabama held the top spot during the regular season.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tide took their No.?1 ranking into Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and came out with a 27ÿ21 overtime victory over LSU. With the win, Alabama clinched its first SEC Western Division Championship since 1999 and guaranteed the team a trip to the 2008 SEC championship game. The Tide then improved to 11ÿ0 with a win at home over Mississippi State. To finish the regular season, Bama defeated in-state rival Auburn, 36ÿ0, the largest margin of victory in the series since 1962. It was Alabama's first victory over Auburn since the 2001 season. In the SEC Championship Game, Alabama suffered its first defeat in a 31ÿ20 loss to the SEC Eastern Division Champion Florida Gators (who later won the 2008 BCS Championship), and closed out the season with a 31ÿ17 loss to Utah in the Sugar Bowl[37] to finish the season at 12ÿ2. For his efforts during the season, Saban received several Coach of the Year awards.[38][39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo.?5 Alabama began Saban's third year by defeating the No.?7 ranked Virginia Tech Hokies in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, 34ÿ24. The Crimson Tide followed up with wins over Florida International and North Texas. The following week Alabama won its conference opener over Arkansas, 35ÿ7.

The epic is said to have been narrated in verse form by a native poet called Kadunung. It was passed on orally until it was presumably jotted down in its complete Bikol narrative by Fray Bernardino de Melendreras de la Trinidad. The Ibalong portrays deeds in heroic proportions, centering on white men or tawong-lipod who were warrior-heroes named, among others, Baltog, Handyong, and Bantong. They came from Boltavara, settling and ruling Bikolandia and its inhabitants. The epic is set in the land of Aslon and Ibalong. The mountains Asog, Masaraga, Isarog, and Lingyon were prominent features of the area.[1]\\r\\nIn its oldest known text, the folk epic does not have a title. The oldest existing account of it is written in Spanish.[1]\\r\\nA non religious festival is celebrated annually in honor of the epic Ibalong as a celebration of the geography of Ibalon. It is unusual because Spaniards introduced saints and fiestas and all religious-related activities except Ibalong. It is also a celebration of the provinces people and their resiliency, given the string calamities that regularly befall the region given its typhoon-prone geographical location.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe full-length narrative is presumably jotted down by Fray Bernardino de Melendreras de la Trinidad (1815-1867),[1] a Franciscan missionary in Guinobatan, Albay, when he got acquainted with an errant Bikolano bard referred to in the epic as Kadunung. It was put afterwards into Spanish by Melendreras in Ibal, a 400-age manuscript in verse on the ancient customs of the Indios of Albay.\\r\\nThe sixty-stanza portion was later included in a treatise on the Bikol region by Fray Jose Casta?o in 1895. However, no credit was given to Melendreras by Casta?o in the work, and so students of the Ibalong have since presumed that it was recorded and translated by Casta?o himself.\\r\\nThe full English translation of the Ibalong was first published in the Far Eastern University Faculty Journal, Manila by Merito B. Espinas.[1]\\r\\nThe epic opens with Iling requesting the bard Kadunung to recount the tale of the glorious Iblong of long ago. Forthwith Kadunung described the ancient land and spoke of its first hero, Baltog, a White Aryan, who had come from Boltavara (Bharata-varsha or India). He planted a linsa patch in Tondol (now in Kamalig) which, one night, was foraged by a giant wild boar (Tandayag). The furious Baltog chased the Tandayag, killed it with his bare hands, and hung its enormous jawbones on a talisay tree in front of his house in Tondol. For this marvelous feat, he was acknowledged chief of the local hunters. The clans of Panicuason and Asog came over to marvel at the monstrous wild boar in Iblong.[2]\\r\\nNext to come was Handyong. With his followers, he fought the monsters of the land. But Oryol, a wily serpent who appeared as a beautiful maiden with a seductive voice, was one whom Handyong could not destroy. Meanwhile, Oryol admired Handyong's bravery and gallantry. Because of this, Oryol helped Handyong clear the region of ferocious beasts until peace came to the whole of the land.\\r\\nWith Iblong rid of wild creatures, Handyong turned to making wise laws and planting the land to linsa and rice. A period of invention followed: boat, farming tools, weaving looms, claywares, kitchen utensils, tree houses, and even a syllabary. Together, the people built a society with culture. It was a golden period in Iblong when even slaves were respected under the laws of Handyong.[2]\\r\\nThen came a great flood, freed by Unos,[2] that changed the features of the land. Three volcanoes, named Hantik, Kulasi, and Isarog erupted simultaneously. Inundations caused lands to sink, from which Lake Buhi came about, or rise, as in the strip of seacoast in Pasacao, Camarines Sur, and wiped out many settlements, especially the Dagatnong settlement in the Kalabangan Gulf.[3] The Malbogong Islet formed in the Bikol River. The Inarihan River altered its course. A lofty mountain sank at Bato, forming a lake.\\r\\nDespite the calamities, Iblong grew powerful under Old Chief Handyong, whose constant companion and good friend, by then, was the young Bantong. Although given a thousand men to destroy the half man and half beast Rabot, who could change its enemies into rocks, Bantong slew it single-handedly ÿ to the loud cheers of his thousand warriors that reverberated throughout the forests and mangroves swamps. Brought to Ligmanan, the corpse of Rabot was horrible to behold. The Great Handyong himself was shocked at the sight.\\r\\nAt this point, the Iblong epic-fragment ends abruptly, and Kadunung promises to continue the story some other time.[2][3]\\r\\nThe fragmentary epic ended at that part where Bantong killed the fierce half-man and beast, Rabot. Curiously, Handyong was saddened by Rabot's death. In her study of the Ibalong Epic, the Bikol scholar, Ma. Lilia F. Realubit, explained that the reason behind this is that Handyong might have \\"mourned the passing of an era, when men were proved men by monsters and the skill of the hunt, when magic and ceremonial incantations infused life and explained his questions about life and nature and the supernatural.\\"[3]\\r\\nShe also added that Handyong could have correctly foresaw the coming of a new age and aptly mourned the death of his time. Meanwhile, some others speculate that he foresaw the subjugation and destitution of his people under a less benevolent leader - as what, indeed, happened under the Spanish colonial rule.[3]\\r\\nThe existence of various Bikol oral accounts focus on a curse allegedly cast against the Bikol people seem to bridge the gap between the Ibalong epic and the subsequent decline and destitution of the Bikolanos. Some of these oral accounts indicated such a transformation. In Sorsogon, the legend of San Bernardino embodied this turn of events against the land and its inhabitants. The legend spoke about a mighty spirit who dwelt in Mt. Bulusan and fell in love with a maiden there. This maiden did not love him back, and so the spirit was enraged. Panic filled everyone except one man - the favored suitor of the maiden. He killed the spirit to stop its violence in the area. Once killed, the spirit fell into the sea. The part of the water in which the spirit fell transformed into land. The old folks claim that the two islands with a slender strip of water between Samar and Sorsogon were the spirit of Mt. Bulusan. It is now called the Strait of San Bernardino and is considered enchanted or engkantado.[3]\\r\\nThe parallelism of the events in the Iblong and the above-cited legend with what actually happened under Spanish rule seems to suggest the total transformation of the inhabitants from a sturdy phase to becoming passive people.[3]\\r\\nThere is no definite date that can be given to where the epic-fragment starts and ends, however what little is known about the legendary beginnings of Bikol might describe the area circa 4, 500 years ago. The epic-fragment portrays ancient Bikol as lush in jungle growth, teeming with fish and wild game, and dotted by mountain ranges, hills, and volcanoes.[1] The bard Kadunung in the epic recounted this as the glorious Bikolandia, a beautiful and fertile ancient land of long ago, inhabited by strong and brave people, that existed before a catastrophe destroyed it some 4,500 years ago.[3]\\r\\nThe Iblong is an invaluable piece of literature that marks the spontaneous record of the ancient Bikol's early struggle for principle, survival, and growth. It commemorates the Bicolano people's resilience against the typhoons that annually beset their region.[4] It stresses the humble accomplishments and peaceful pursuits of the early Bikolanos, including the implementation of just laws. Among other pursuits is the cultivation of upland and lowland crops, the construction of dwellings on tall trees, the creation of the first boat in the region, the making of utensils, tools, and wares, but most importantly, the invention of writing. The epic depicts the transition of the ancient Bikolanos from the hunting stage to the agricultural stage, from the nomadic state to the settled life.\\r\\nThe Ibalong teaches about courage, of how a simple act can bring about positive change. The heroes made use of this courage to lead the community out of chaos without any regard for self-glorification. This gives evidence of good leadership. However, it must also be noted that all three heroes were foreigners and not pure inhabitants of the Ibalong. This poses an argument that the locals had to depend on foreign abilities and leadership before they were able to obtain progress.[5]\\r\\nAlso portrayed in the epic is the concept of social class, of slaves and masters. However, this did not hinder the growth of the community because the classes respected each other.\\r\\nThe Ibalong stresses the humble accomplishments and peaceful pursuits of the early Bikolanos. It is unlikely that the ancient Bikolanos had worshiped idols. Nothing is mentioned about gods in the epic except perhaps in passing, Onos, the god of floodwaters.[1]\\r\\nThe very survival of these pre-Hispanic legends is direct proof of the vitality of Bikol culture. Folk history or not, this epic is valuable for it enabled the Bikolanos of today to gain valuable insights into the misty past of their land and their ancestors.[6]\\r\\nThe epic is celebrated through street performances and floats on Ibalong Festival in Legazpi City, Bicol region since 1992.[7] This is celebrated in Legazpi City during the month of August. The Ibalong festival features the various characters from the epic while celebrating through song and dance. It is also performed in theaters like Tanghalang Pilipino's Ibalong the Musical by Rody Vera.[8]\\r\\nMany accomplishments and advances made by the ancient Bikols were credited to various characters mentioned in the epic.[1]\\r\\nBaltog: Baltog was the first white man or tawong-lipod to come to Bikol. Born in India (although India is called \\"Boltavara\\" in the epic) to the brave clan of Lipod, he introduced agriculture to Bikol by planting linsa or apay, which was a characteristic of early Indian colonizers. He slew the Tandayag Boar in a bone-wracking combat.[1]\\r\\nBantong: Bantong was a brave and cunning young warrior who single-handedly killed the half-man and half-wild beast Rabot, although Handyong had given him 1,000 warriors to help him do it.[1]\\r\\nDinahong: Dinahong, meaning \\"wrapped with leaves\\", is the original Bikolano potter who was believed to have been an Agta (Negrito) or pygmy. He helped the people learn cooking, making pots called coron, stoves, earthen jars, and other kitchen utensils.[1]\\r\\nGinantong: Ginantong made the plow, harrow, and other farming tools.[2]\\r\\nHablom: Hablom, from the verb hablon meaning to weave, was the inventor of the first weaving loom and bobbins in the Bikol region, especially for weaving abaca clothes.[1]\\r\\nHandyong: The central figure in the epic is Handyong. He came to Bikol with his followers after Baltog, and came to be the most famous of the tawong-lipod. He cleared the land of predatory monsters, inspired inventions, reintroduced agriculture, built tree-houses where anitos or idols were kept called moog, and set up a code of laws, establishing a golden age in his day.[1] He is also known to have built the first boat and developed rice cultivation in flooded areas.[9]\\r\\nKimantong: Kimantong is attributed to have been the first Bikolano to fashion the rudder called timon, the sail called layag, the plow called arado, the harrow called surod, the ganta and other measures, the roller, the yoke, the bolo, and the hoe. A baranggay called Kimantong is found in Daraga, Albay.[1]\\r\\nSural: Sural, or surat, meaning to write or letter was the first Bikolano to have thought of a syllabry. He carved it on a white rock-slab from Libong, which Gapon later polished.[1]\\r\\nTakay: Takay was a lovely maiden who, according to legend, drowned during the great flood in the epic. He is believed to have become the water hyacinth in what is now Lake Bato.[1]\\r\\nWild Carabaos: Wild carabaos were not yet domesticated for farm work back then. They freely roamed the mountains in the early days. Handyong was able to domesticate the big-bodied beasts \\"in a short while\\".[1]\\r\\nGiant Crocodile: Also called buaya, Handyong defeated the giant crocodiles in combat. Handyong was assisted by Oryol in killing many of them, which lead tinged the Bikol River red with blood. The survivors were banished, along with Sarimao, to Mount Kulasi.[1]\\r\\nLong before Spaniards arrived in Bikol and introduced Christianity, the Bikolanos already believed in gods and supernatural beings. The epic-fragment contains many of the supernatural faith and religion that the ancient Bikols had. Among them are supernatural creatures.[1]\\r\\nAngongolood: The Angongolood lurked along shadowy riversides. They were hideous apes that transformed their victims into trees surprising them in a tight embrace.[1]\\r\\nBuring: The Buring was a one-eyed, three-throated creature which inhabited the swampy wastes of Ponong.[1]\\r\\nRabot: Rabot was a ferocious half-human half-monster that could turn people into rock by magic. Rabot is ugly, a liar, and had a loud voice. Bantong slew the monster using his bolo.[1]\\r\\nSarimao: The Sarimao were avenging monsters that were brutally fierce, ugly, and ruinous. They went after evildoers, usually to those with hidden guilt, who could not be brought to justice. Handyong exiled the Sarimao to Mount Kulasi. Their human equivalents are believed to be those who take the law into their own hands, who have suffered injustice.[1]\\r\\nSerpents: The serpents were probably relate to Oryol, a serpent with a beautiful voice and could change its image to deceive enemies. Handyong sealed all the serpents inside a huge cave in Mount Hantik.[1]\\r\\nTandayag Boar: The word tandayag means giant, meaning that it could be any living being that had grown very old and enormous. In the epic, Tandayag was the boar slewn by Baltog.[1]\\r\\nTiburon: The Tiburon were giant flying fishes which had slimy, scaly, and hardy flesh and saw-like teeth that could crush rocks. Handiong and his men did not stop until they vanquished every Tiburon.[2]\\r\\nWinged sharks: The winged sharks mentioned were not really winged sharks but rather manta rays that would sometimes pop out of the water like flying bats. These monsters were soon restrained by Handyong to keep waters safe for his followers.[1]\\r\\nMoog: Moogs are treehouses where the ancient Bikols' lived and kept anitos and idols.[1]\\r\\nDagatnong settlement: In the epic, the Dagatnong settlement was said to have been swept away by the Great Flood. The Dagatnong were the black pygmies who swelt on seacoasts, opposite of the Agta who lived in the highlands. The dagatnong originally came from Kotmong.[1]\\r\\nAslong: Meaning \\"faintly visible\\", was famous for its tales of sweet enchantment in the glorious days of long ago. Presently, almost nothing is left of it but a few ridges around a shallowing crater.[1]\\r\\nAsog: Meaning \\"with only one testicle\\", it refers to the effeminate black priests of Aswang's devil-cult that had its center in the wilds of this volcano during Bikol's epic age. It may also refer to a priest dressed like a woman. Asog is now called Mount Iriga.[1]\\r\\nHantik: A big species of ants, the hantiks, gave Hantik its name. The ants are believed to have inhabited this mountain's Kalupnitan Caves, where Handyong drove and buried alive the wily, sweet-voiced serpents that masqueraded as lovely maidens.[1]\\r\\nIsarog: From the word isaro meaning \\"put together\\", Isarog was the rugged volcano where the angonglood of the Bikol River forests fled to escape the wrath of Handyong.[1]\\r\\nMasaraga: Masaraga is believed to have been where the Sarimao had their cave. The name comes from the intensifier ma and saga, meaning \\"a brilliant flame\\" or \\"glaring\\".[1]\\r\\nThe differences of the Ibalong from other Philippine epics may suggest culture differences of the Ancient Bikols from other ancient groups.","input":"From what region of the philippines came the ibalong epic?"},{"output":"eleven","context":"The 70th Academy Awards ceremony, organized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), took place on March 23, 1998, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles beginning at 6:00?p.m. PST / 9:00?p.m. EST.

With eleven awards, Titanic tied with Ben-Hur for the most academy awards in Oscar history.[13] It also became the first film to win Best Picture without a screenplay nomination since 1965's The Sound of Music.[14] Best Actress winner Helen Hunt was the first performer to win an Oscar while concurrently starring in a television series;[15] Jack Nicholson became the fourth performer to win at least three acting Oscars.[16] Both won for their roles in As Good as it Gets, making it the seventh film to win both lead acting awards.[17] Nominated for their performances as Rose DeWitt Bukater in Titanic, Best Actress nominee Kate Winslet and Best Supporting Actress nominee Gloria Stuart became the first pair of actress nominated for portraying the same character in the same film.[18][19] At age 87, Stuart also became the oldest performer nominated for a competitive Oscar.[20]\\r\\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger ().[21]\\r\\nThe following 16 films received multiple nominations:\\r\\nThe following four films received multiple awards:\\r\\nThe following individuals presented awards or performed musical numbers.[23][24]\\r\\nIn December 1997, the Academy hired veteran Oscar telecast producer Gil Cates to oversee the 1998 ceremony.[26] Gil has become the consummate Oscar show producer, consistently garnering top television ratings for the telecast, said AMPAS president Robert Rehme in a press release announcing the selection. His shows are full of wit, charm and surprise.[26] A few days later, actor and comedian Billy Crystal was chosen to emcee the upcoming telecast. Cates explained his reason to bring back the veteran comedian saying, \\"Billy's performance last year was spectacular. There is nobody like him.\\"[27] In an article published in USA Today he initially requested to Cates and AMPAS five months after the previous year's ceremony that he would like to take a break from hosting duties.

The colour of the ribbon depends of the school (HG, HF, HTX, HHX = blue; STX = red). An education at STX involves all the lessons you can have in Denmark, while HHX and HTX is more the lessons you want yourself and you mix it yourself.

In HHX, HTX you chose some of these lessons and mix it on your own. You can have the lessons on an A-level (means every three years), B-level (two of the years), C-level (one of the years). In STX you must have Danish and history in an A-level, and English in either A or B. The rest you make up by choice, and you can change it during the years.\\r\\nThe levels of the lessons also depend of the subject line you chose. There're the linguistic lines, the social study lines, the math lines, the chemistry lines, the physics lines, the biotech lines, the music lines and sport lines. The EP/health lessons are either on a C or B-level, but no matter what you chose you have it every year. Here the levels just tell if you're very good at sport and you just really love it, or if you're not that interested in it. If you're on a B-level you'll have quite more EP-lessons than the C-level.\\r\\nYou go to exams in 1.g, 2.g and 3.g.\\r\\nThe grades are following (starting with the worst, ending with the best): -3: means you performed unacceptably. 00: dumped. 02: acceptable, but not good. 4: low average but okay. 7: high average and good. 10: over the average, very good job. 12: much over the average, excellent job.\\r\\nIn Finland, ninth grade is the last year of compulsory schooling. The students are usually 15 ÿ 16 years old. Afterwards they can choose to go through tenth grade but it is not required. The meaning of tenth grade is to give an opportunity to improve grades.\\r\\nIn France, the equivalent grade is the troisime or \\"3me\\" and it is the final school year before high school.\\r\\nStudents prepare to take the \\"Dipl?me National du Brevet\\" (DNB) examination - it's the first diploma given to French students, and attests of basic levels in major high school disciplines (French, Mathematics, History and Geography and Arts). This diploma is not necessary to proceed on to high school.\\r\\nIn Germany, the equivalent grade is 9. Klasse.\\r\\nIn Hong Kong, 9th grade is called Form 3. Students finishing 9th grade are needed to select their electives for them to study in Grade 10, Grade 11 and Grade 12\\r\\nIn India, the ninth grade is the second last year of the secondary school. Students undergo and prepare for final secondary school examinations called the SSC Exam for two years i.e. grade 9 and 10 before getting into higher secondary i.e. grade 11 and 12 called the HSSC Exam.\\r\\nIn Ireland, it is the Third Year or Tr~ Bhliain of Secondary School (for 14- and 15-year-olds) this is known as 3rd year. This year is the year students take the Junior Certificate or Teastas S܇isearach.\\r\\nIn Italy, it is the first year of the upper secondary school (which translates into scuola secondaria di secondo grado, informally called scuola superiore). In Italy ninth grade is called prima superiore.\\r\\nIn New Zealand, Year 10 (formerly Form 4) is the equivalent of ninth grade, with students aged 14 or 15 during the year. It is the second year of secondary school and the tenth year of compulsory education. Students in Year 10 typically study English, mathematics, science, social science, and health and physical education, with students electing subjects out of the arts, technology, and learning language.\\r\\nIn Malaysia, the equivalent of 9th grade is Form 3 (Tingkatan 3). Students are 15 years old, and it is their third year of secondary school. In Form 3, all students are required to sit for a mandatory exam throughout all government schools called PT3 (Pentaksiran Tingkatan 3, or Form 3 Assessment). Upon receiving their results, students will be allowed to choose a stream (the subjects of their focus for the next year) of their choice, depending on their results, which will then allow them to proceed to Form 4 in the following year.\\r\\nIn Mexico, ninth grade is the last year of middle school. The students are aged 14ÿ15.\\r\\nIn Norway, 9th grade is the middle grade of middle school, \\"ungdomskolen\\". Students are 14-15 years old.\\r\\nIn Pakistan, 9th grade have a great importance as it is the base of higher education. At this level students are allowed to choose the subjects of their will. These subjects are:-\\r\\nThe compulsory subjects are:-\\r\\nMarks of grade 9 are half of collective 9th and 10th marks.\\r\\nIn the Philippines, Grade 9 is the third year of Junior High School.Topics mainly discussed are the following subjects like, for the major subjects are Geometry (Math in Grade 9), Chemistry (Science in Grade 9), Filipino subject with Noli Me Tangere, Anglo-American Literature (English) and Philippine Economical Study (Political Studies in Grade 9). Values Education, MAPEH (Music, Arts, Physical Education and Health), Computer and TLE (Technology and Livelihood Education) are some of the minor subjects. Students are usually 14ÿ15 years old.\\r\\nIn Portugal, the ninth grade (nono ano, 9o ano) is the last year of the three-year 3o Ciclo do Ensino Bsico that also includes the seventh grade and the eighth grade. It is followed by the tenth grade, the first year of the three-year Ensino Secundrio. At the end of the ninth grade, students must take national final exams (Provas finais nacionais).\\r\\nIn Singapore, 9th grade is called Secondary 3, and it is the third year of one's secondary education. Students are usually 15 years old.\\r\\nIn Sweden, ninth grade is the last year of h?gstadiet (Secondary school). The students are usually between 15 and 16 years old. That makes ninth grade an important grade for almost every student.\\r\\nNinth Grade in Spanish is called 3o de ESO (tercero de Educaci܇n Secundaria Obligatoria), as it is the third year of the compulsory secondary education. Students are usually 14ÿ15 years old. Secondary school in Spain has a four year duration. Students in Spain generally start secondary school at the age of 12, and finish at the age of 16. The school year starts in September and lasts until the next year in June.\\r\\nIn English and Welsh schools, 9th grade (in terms of age requirements) is equivalent to Year 10 (called Year 11 in Northern Ireland), the fourth year of comprehensive/high/grammar school. Most students in the UK (except for Scotland) start secondary school at the age of 11, and finish at the end of the academic year (September 1 ÿ August 31) in which their 16th birthday falls when they sit GCSE exams. Compulsory education continues beyond 16, when students can choose to remain at school in the \\"Sixth Form\\" or attend a sixth form college or further education college to take AS levels and A levels or follow vocational courses or apprenticeships. Students are age 14 to 15 in this grade.\\r\\nIn Scotland, this is third year (or S3) of secondary school. Most children are aged 14-15. In S3 students will pick subjects to study for \\"National 4/5 exams\\" in S4, which are the qualifications they will need for college.\\r\\nIn the United States, ninth grade is usually the first year in high school (called \\"upper secondary school\\" in other countries). In this system, ninth graders are also often referred to as freshmen. It can also be the last year of junior high school. The typical age for U.S. 9th grade students is 14 to 15 years.\\r\\nIn the math curriculum, ninth graders are usually taught Algebra, but advanced math include Geometry or Algebra II. Most basic students usually take Pre-Algebra in their last year of middle school, advanced students will take Algebra I, and Honors students will take honors pre-algebra. Advanced courses are usually available to ninth graders who are prepared for a more rigorous curriculum, depending on the school district. Some districts across the country allow their 10th graders to take Trigonometry or AP Statistics, or even Calculus if the district provides, but most often, the highest level available to be taken as a 10th grader is Pre-Calculus.\\r\\nIn the English curriculum, most schools still have the same levels of basic courses, advanced courses, and honors courses. The basic level for a 9th grader is often listed as English I (may also be called English 9). This course will often teach the fundamentals of higher-level literature and how to analyze and respond to such literature. The advanced course is often English II (may also be called English 10) depending on the school district and is usually a genre studies type of English class, but it may instead be focused on one type of literature, such as American literature or British Literature. The honors level for 9th grade is usually English I HNR (may also be called Honors English I) and is usually focused on one type of literature (i.e. American Literature, British Literature), but if this was already covered it previous classes, it may be a genre study English course. Although rare, a district or school may allow a student to take AP Literature their 9th grade year.\\r\\nIn the social studies curriculum, there is a variety of different courses that may be offered. Most often, though, the course is either a Geography class, a Government class, a World History class, or a Exploring Civics class.\\r\\nIn the science curriculum, ninth grade students are required, in most areas, to take Earth Science, Science Topics, or Biology. As far as the course level, Integrated Science 1A is usually taken by the basic student.\\r\\nMost high school students are required to have one carnegie unit of Computer Science, one unit of Physical Education, and one unit of Health Education in order to graduate[citation needed]. These students are usually offered foreign language this year. This is often the first introduction of foreign language to the students.","input":"How old is a freshman in high school in america?"},{"output":"Arsenal","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup, is a knockout competition in English football, organised by and named after The Football Association (the FA). It is the oldest existing football competition in the world,[1] having commenced in the 1871ÿ72 season.[2] The tournament is open to all clubs in the top 10 levels of the English football league system, although a club's home stadium must meet certain requirements prior to entering the tournament.[3] The competition culminates at the end of the league season usually in May with the FA Cup Final, officially named The Football Association Challenge Cup Final Tie, which has traditionally been regarded as the showpiece finale of the English football season.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the final venues, apart from four, have been in London with most being played at the original Wembley Stadium, which was used from 1923 until the stadium closed in 2000. The other venues that were used for the final prior to 1923 were Kennington Oval, Crystal Palace, Stamford Bridge and Lillie Bridge, all in London, Goodison Park in Liverpool and Fallowfield Stadium and Old Trafford in Manchester. The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff hosted the final for six years (2001ÿ2006), while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction. Other grounds have been used for replays, which until 1999 took place if the initial match ended in a draw. The new Wembley Stadium has been the permanent venue of the final since 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2018, the record for the most wins is held by Arsenal with 13 victories.[2] The cup has been won by the same team in two or more consecutive years on ten occasions, and four teams have won consecutive finals more than once: Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal.[2] The cup has been won by a non-English team once. The cup is currently held by Chelsea, who defeated Manchester United in the 2018 final.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winners of the first tournament were Wanderers, a team of former public schoolboys based in London, who went on to win the competition five times in its first seven seasons. The early winners of the competition were all teams of wealthy amateurs from the south of England,[5] but in 1883, Blackburn Olympic became the first team from the north to win the cup, defeating Old Etonians. Upon his team's return to Blackburn, Olympic captain Albert Warburton proclaimed: \\"The Cup is very welcome to Lancashire. It'll have a good home and it'll never go back to London.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the advent of professionalism at around the same time, the amateur teams quickly faded from prominence in the competition.[5] The leading professional clubs formed The Football League in 1888.[7] Since then, one non-league team has won the cup. Tottenham Hotspur, then of the Southern League, defeated Sheffield United of The Football League to win the 1901 final.[8] A year later Sheffield United returned to the final and won the cup, which then remained in the hands of Northern and Midland clubs until Tottenham won it again in 1921.[2] In 1927, Cardiff City, a team which plays in the English football league system despite being based in Wales, won the cup, the only non-English club to do so.[9] Scottish club Queens Park reached the final twice in the early years of the competition.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nNewcastle United enjoyed a brief spell of FA Cup dominance in the 1950s, winning the trophy three times in five years,[2] and in the 1960s, Tottenham Hotspur enjoyed a similar spell of success, with three wins in seven seasons. This marked the start of a successful period for London-based clubs, with 11?wins in 22?seasons.[10] Teams from the second tier of English football, at the time called the Second Division, experienced an unprecedented run of cup success between 1973 and 1980.[10] Sunderland won the cup in 1973, Southampton repeated the feat in 1976, and West Ham United won in 1980, the most recent victory by a team from outside the top division.[2][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 1999, a draw in the final would result in the match being replayed at a later date;[11] since then the final has always been decided on the day, with a penalty shootout as required.[12] As of 2017 a penalty shoot-out has been required on only two occasions, in the 2005 and 2006 finals. The competition did not take place during the First and Second World Wars, other than in the 1914ÿ15 season, when it was completed, and the 1939ÿ40 season, when it was abandoned during the qualifying rounds.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll teams are English, except where marked  (Scottish) or   (Welsh).\\r\\n\\r\\nA. ^  The official attendance for the 1923 final was reported as 126,047, but the actual figure is believed to be anywhere between 150,000 and 300,000.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nTeams shown in italics are no longer in existence.

It is involved in the comprehension or understanding of written and spoken language (in contrast to Broca's area that is involved in the production of language). It is traditionally thought to be in Brodmann area 22, which is located in the superior temporal lobe in the dominant cerebral hemisphere (which is the left hemisphere in about 95% of right handed individuals and 60% of left handed individuals). Damage caused to Wernicke's area results in receptive, fluent aphasia. This means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words, but the phrases will lack meaning. This is unlike non-fluent aphasia, in which the person will use meaningful words, but in a non-fluent, telegraphic manner.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWernicke's area is classically located in the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the (most commonly) left cerebral hemisphere. This area encircles the auditory cortex on the lateral sulcus (the part of the brain where the temporal lobe and parietal lobe meet).[2] This area is neuroanatomically described as the posterior part of Brodmann area 22.\\r\\nHowever, there is an absence of consistent definitions as to the location.[3] [4] Some identify it with the unimodal auditory association in the superior temporal gyrus anterior to the primary auditory cortex (the anterior part of BA 22).[5] This is the site most consistently implicated in auditory word recognition by functional brain imaging experiments.[6][7] Others include also adjacent parts of the heteromodal cortex in BA 39 and BA40 in the parietal lobe.[8]\\r\\nWhile previously thought to connect Wernicke's area and Broca's area, new research demonstrates that the arcuate fasciculus instead connects to posterior receptive areas with premotor/motor areas, and not to Broca's area.[9] Consistent with the word recognition site identified in brain imaging, the uncinate fasciculus connects anterior superior temporal regions with Broca's area.[10]\\r\\nResearch using Transcranial magnetic stimulation suggests that the area corresponding to the Wernickes area in the non-dominant cerebral hemisphere has a role in processing and resolution of subordinate meanings of ambiguous wordssuch as river when given the ambiguous word \\"bank.\\" In contrast, the Wernicke's area in the dominant hemisphere processes dominant word meanings (teller given bank).[11]\\r\\nNeuroimaging suggests the functions earlier attributed to Wernicke's area occur more broadly in the temporal lobe and indeed happen also in Broca's area.\\r\\n... the range of areas implicated in speech processing go well beyond the classical language areas typically mentioned for speech; the vast majority of textbooks still state that this aspect of perception and language processing occurs in Wernickes area (the posterior third of the STG).[12]\\r\\nSupport for a broad range of speech processing areas was furthered by a recent study done at University of Rochester in which American Sign Language native speakers were subject to MRIs while interpreting sentences that identified a relationship using either syntax (relationship is determined by the word order) or inflection (relationship is determined by physical motion of \\"moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body\\"). Distinct areas of the brain were activated with the frontal cortex (associated with ability to put information into sequences) being more active in the syntax condition and the temporal lobes (associated with dividing information into its constituent parts) being more active in the inflection condition. However, these areas are not mutually exclusive and show a large amount of overlap. These findings imply that while speech processing is a very complex process, the brain may be using fairly basic, preexisting computational methods.[13]\\r\\nWernicke's area is named after Carl Wernicke, a German neurologist and psychiatrist who, in 1874, hypothesized a link between the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and the reflexive mimicking of words and their syllables that associated the sensory and motor images of spoken words.[14] He did this on the basis of the location of brain injuries that caused aphasia. Receptive aphasia in which such abilities are preserved is also known as Wernicke's aphasia. In this condition there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal syntax. Language as a result is largely meaningless (a condition sometimes called fluent or jargon aphasia).\\r\\nWhile neuroimaging and lesion evidence generally support the idea that malfunction of or damage to Wernicke's area is common in people with receptive aphasia, this is not always so. Some people may use the right hemisphere for language, and isolated damage of Wernicke's area cortex (sparing white matter and other areas) may not cause severe receptive aphasia.[3][15] Even when patients with Wernicke's area lesions have comprehension deficits, these are usually not restricted to language processing alone. For example, one study found that patients with posterior lesions also had trouble understanding nonverbal sounds like animal and machine noises.[16] In fact, for Wernicke's area, the impairments in nonverbal sounds were statistically stronger than for verbal sounds.","input":"What are the functions of the broca and wernicke areas?"},{"output":"Mandalay Bay hotel","context":"24 guns in total, including:[1]\\r\\nThe 2017 Las Vegas shooting occurred on the night of Sunday, October 1, 2017 when a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, leaving 58 people dead and 851 injured. Between 10:05 and 10:15?p.m. PDT, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, fired more than 1,100 rounds from his suite on the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel. About an hour after he fired his last shot into the crowd, he was found dead in his room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His motive remains unknown.\\r\\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States. It reignited the debate about gun laws in the U.S., with attention focused on bump fire stocks, which Paddock used to fire semi-automatic rifles at a rate similar to that of a fully automatic weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Strip is a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard immediately south of the city of Las Vegas in Clark County, Nevada. The Strip is known for its concentration of casinos and resort hotels, including the 43-story Mandalay Bay southwest of its intersection with Mandalay Bay Road, in the unincorporated town of Paradise.[2]\\r\\nLas Vegas Village, a 15-acre (6.1-hectare) lot used for outdoor performances, is located diagonally across the intersection to the northeast.[2][3] From 2014 onward, the venue hosted the annual Route 91 Harvest country music festival. The 2017 festival ran from September 29 to October 1, with over 22,000 attendees on the final day.[3][4][a]\\r\\nStephen Paddock was a 64-year-old former auditor and real estate businessman who had been living 80 miles (130?km) northeast of Las Vegas in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada.[5] Paddock was twice divorced, had a long-term girlfriend, and had no known children.[6] He was a son of Benjamin Paddock, a bank robber who was on the FBI's most-wanted list between 1969 and 1977.[6] Paddock's only recorded interactions with law enforcement were traffic citations.[7]\\r\\nPaddock was a high-stakes gambler who placed bets at a high enough level to earn valuable compsfree benefits such as rooms and meals.[8] He was a familiar figure to casino hosts in Las Vegas, but was not well known among other high-stakes gamblers because he mostly played video poker.[8] He reportedly kept to himself and was a heavy drinker.[9] Paddock had lost a significant amount of his wealth over the previous two years,[10] but had paid off all gambling debts before the shooting.[11]\\r\\nPaddock may have considered attacking other events. He had researched large-scale venues in cities such as Boston since at least May 2017,[11] and had reserved a room overlooking the August 2017 Lollapalooza festival in Chicago, but did not use it.[12] According to his girlfriend, she and Paddock were at the Mandalay Bay during an earlier stay a month before the attack when he repeatedly cased out Las Vegas Village from different windows in their room.[13] From September 17, Paddock stayed at The Ogden in Downtown Las Vegas, which overlooked the open-air Life Is Beautiful festival that ran from September 22 to September 24.[13][4] His internet search terms from mid-September included \\"swat weapons\\", \\"ballistics chart 308\\", \\"SWAT Las Vegas\\", and \\"do police use explosives\\".[13]\\r\\nPaddock arrived at the Mandalay Bay on September 25, 2017. He was booked into Room 32-135, a complimentary room on the 32nd floor.[4][8] Four days later, he also checked into the directly-connected Room 32-134. Both suites overlook the site of the concert at Las Vegas Village.[4][14][b] Between September 25 and October 1the day of the shootinghe stockpiled an arsenal of weapons, associated equipment and ammunition that included fourteen AR-15 rifles (twelve of which had bump stocks and 100-round magazines), eight AR-10 rifles, a bolt-action rifle, and a revolver. Often with the help of hotel bellhops, he brought five suitcases to his room on September 25, seven on the 26th, two on the 28th, six on the 30th, and two on October 1.[15][13][4] Cell phone records also show that he also made multiple visits to his home in Mesquite. On September 30, he placed \\"Do not disturb\\" signs on the doors of both rooms.[15] Paddock spent much of his time at the Mandalay Bay before the shooting gambling, often at night. He interacted with Mandalay Bay employees more than ten times during his stay, including twice on the day of the shooting; an MGM Resorts International spokesperson said they were all \\"normal in nature\\".[16]\\r\\nThe mass shooting occurred between 10:05 and 10:15?p.m. PDT on October 1, 2017, which was the third and final night of the festival. When the shooting began, country music singer Jason Aldean was giving the closing performance.[17]\\r\\nShortly before 10:00?p.m., hotel security guard Jesus Campos was sent to the 32nd floor to investigate an open-door alert. He attempted to open a door that provided immediate access to the floor, but found that it would not open. After Campos entered the floor, he discovered an L-shaped bracket screwed into the door and door frame, which was responsible for barring the door from opening. After reporting the discovery to his dispatch center, he heard the sound of rapid drilling coming from Room 32-135 and went to investigate the matter. At approximately 10:05, he was hit in the right thigh by one of about 35 bullets that Paddock fired through the door of his suite. After Campos was hit, he took cover in the alcove between Rooms 32-122 and 32-124 and immediately informed the hotel by radio and cellphone that he had been shot, though he believed he had been shot with a BB or pellet gun. At the same time, maintenance worker Stephen Schuck was on the same floor to fix the door that Campos had reported as being barricaded. Campos, who was already injured, encountered Schuck and told him to take cover. Schuck contacted hotel dispatchers over his radio, informed them of the ongoing shooting, and told them to call the police.[4][18][19][20][21] Neither Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department nor MGM Resorts International, the Mandalay Bay's owner, have confirmed when information about the initial shooting was relayed to the police.[22][23][24][25]\\r\\nAfter Paddock used a hammer to break two of the windows in both of his suites,[4] he began shooting through them at 10:05?p.m.[26] He ultimately fired more than 1,100 rifle rounds[27] approximately 490 yards (450?m) into the festival audience.[28][29][30][c] He initially started out with a few single gunshots before firing in prolonged bursts.[4] Many people in the crowd initially mistook the gunfire for fireworks.[31] During the shooting, a security fence hindered concertgoers from fleeing the 15-acre concrete lot.[32] The gunfire continued, with some momentary pauses, over the span of ten minutes and ended by 10:15?p.m.[33][34]\\r\\nIn addition to shooting at the concertgoers, Paddock fired eight bullets at a large jet fuel tank at McCarran International Airport 2,000 feet (600?m) away.[4] Two of those bullets struck the exterior of the tank, with one bullet penetrating the tank. The fuel did not explode because jet fuel is mostly kerosene, which is unlikely to ignite when struck by a bullet.[35]\\r\\nDuring the shooting, police officers were initially confused whether the shots were coming from the Mandalay Bay, the nearby Luxor hotel, or the festival grounds.[32] There were also multiple false reports of additional shooters at other hotels on the Strip.[36] Officers eventually spotted multiple flashes of gunfire in the middle of the northern side of Mandalay Bay and responded to the hotel. At 10:12?p.m., two officers on the 31st floor reported the sounds of gunfire on the floor above them.[32] When officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17?p.m. and encountered Campos a minute later, he directed them to Paddock's room and helped others evacuate. Campos was then directed to seek medical attention for himself.[19][21]\\r\\nBetween 10:26 and 10:30?p.m., eight additional officers arrived at the 32nd floor; some of those officers manually breached through the door Paddock had screwed shut with the bracket. The gunfire had ceased, and the police moved systematically down the hallway, searching and clearing each room, using a master key that was provided by Campos. At 10:55?p.m., the officers finished evacuating guests. At 11:20?p.m., police breached Room 32-135 with explosives.[4][32][34][37] Paddock was found dead on the floor from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.[38][39] Police then breached Room 32-134; while entering the hotel suite, an officer accidentally fired a three-round burst from his weapon, but the bullets did not hit anyone.[4][40] At 11:27?p.m., officers announced over the police radio that a suspect was down.[34][41]\\r\\nMuch of Las Vegas Boulevard was closed while police SWAT teams combed the venue and neighboring businesses. McCarran International Airport, adjacent to the shooting site, was shut down for several hours.[42] Approximately 300 people entered the airport property as they fled to safety from the shooting.[31] This prompted officials to shut down all four runways. More than 25 flights were rerouted to ensure that no aircraft would be hit by gunfire,[36] while other flights were canceled before airfield operations resumed at 12:40?a.m. on October 2.[43] At approximately 2:45?p.m. PDT on October 2, a state of emergency was declared in Clark County.[44][45]\\r\\nEarly on October 2, Sheriff Lombardo identified the suspect as Stephen Paddock.[46]\\r\\nFifty-eight people were shot to death at the music festival; Paddock's suicide was the only death at the Mandalay Bay Hotel.[47][48][49] The fatalities included 36 women and 22 men.[47] The oldest was 67, the youngest 20.[50] Six were from Nevada, 35 from California, 13 from other states, and four from Canada.[51] The Clark County Coroner's Office determined that all 58 victims died as a result of gunshot wounds.[52] Thirty one of the victims were pronounced dead at the scene, while the rest were pronounced dead at hospitals.[11]\\r\\nAn additional 851 people were injured, 422 of them with gunshot wounds.[24][53] In the aftermath, many victims were transported to area hospitals, which included University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center, and at least one of the six hospitals of Valley Health System.[54][55][56] Sunrise Hospital treated the largest portion of the wounded: 199 patients,[57] 150 of whom arrived within a timespan of about 40 minutes.[58] For reasons that are unclear, most patients were transported to Sunrise, a Level II trauma center. University Medical Center, a nearby Level I trauma center, treated 104 patients.[59] Six victims sought medical treatment in Southern California; UC Irvine Medical Center treated four and Loma Linda University Medical Center treated two.[60]\\r\\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States, exceeding the death toll of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, where 49 people were shot and killed.[47][61][62]\\r\\nOn the morning after the shooting, lines to donate blood in Las Vegas stretched for blocks. Wait times were as much as six hours or more.[63] Millions of dollars have also been raised to help victims and their families.[64]\\r\\nNevada Governor Brian Sandoval called the shooting \\"a tragic and heinous act of violence that has shaken the Nevada family\\".[65] Jason Aldean, who was singing when the shooting started, posted his condolences on Instagram and noted all of those working with him at the show had survived the attack.[66]\\r\\nAt a press conference, President Donald Trump described Paddock as \\"a very very sick individual\\", and \\"a demented man, [with] a lot of problems\\". He added, \\"the police department has done such an incredible job, and we'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by\\".[67][68] A White House official talking points memo, distributed to Trump allies, opposed tightening gun control since \\"new laws won't stop a mad man\\", but \\"will curtail the freedoms of law abiding citizens\\".[69] On October 2, Trump issued a proclamation to honor the victims and their families.[70][71] On October 4, Trump visited the shooting victims and first responders.[72]\\r\\nA unity prayer walk and ceremony was held in Las Vegas on October 7 in honor of the dead. Speakers at the ceremony included Vice President Mike Pence and Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman.[73] On the evening of October 15, thousands participated in a commemorative 3 mile walk between Circus Circus and Mandalay Bay.[74]\\r\\nThe annual Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Marathon took place on November 12 and was the largest event to be held in the city since the shooting. The event received a massive amount of security, which included 350 officers, counter-sniper surveillance posts, and a number of barriers composed of dump trucks, buses, and other large vehicles.[75]\\r\\nThe expansion Vegas Golden Knights of the NHL held a tribute to the victims and honoured response personnel before their inaugural home game on October 10.[76] Later during the season, the number 58 became the first number in team history to be retired, chosen for the 58 deaths during the shooting.[77]\\r\\nThe future of the Las Vegas Village site remains undetermined.[78]\\r\\nThe shooting prompted support in the U.S. Congress for assault weapons legislation that would ban bump fire stocks. The National Rifle Association (NRA) came out in favor of administrative bump fire stock regulations.[47] Many Congressional Democrats and some Republicans expressed their support of a prohibition of bump fire stocks.[79] Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced a Senate bill that gained 39 Democratic co-sponsors. Two bipartisan bills have been introduced in the House of Representatives. As of November, no Congressional action has been taken. House leaders said the issue of bump fire stock regulation should be decided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, which originally approved gun-stocks.[80] On November 6, Massachusetts became the first state to ban the sale, possession, or use of the devices.[81]\\r\\nNine days after the shooting, eighteen Democratic U.S. Senators introduced a bill, the Keep Americans Safe Act, which, if signed into law, would ban gun magazines that hold more than ten rounds of ammunition.[82]\\r\\nStock prices of firearms manufacturers rose the day after the shooting, as has happened after similar incidents. Investors expect gun sales will increase over concerns that such an event could lead to more stringent gun-control legislation and a rush of customers wishing to defend themselves against future attacks.[83][84]\\r\\nAccording to authorities with the Clark County Commissioner, the name \\"1 October\\" was declared the official title for investigations into the mass shooting.[85]\\r\\nInvestigators found hidden surveillance cameras that were placed inside and outside the hotel room, presumably so Paddock could monitor the arrival of others.[86] The cameras were not in record mode.[87] Police said a handwritten note found in the room indicated Paddock had been calculating the distance, wind, and trajectory from his 32nd floor hotel suite to the concertgoers he was targeting on the festival lot.[88][89]\\r\\nAt a press conference on October 4, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo stated there was evidencewhich he declined to discussthat Paddock intended to escape the scene, and that he may have had assistance from an accomplice.[90] Investigators searched Paddock's room and found a \\"bulletproof vest\\" and breathing apparatus, which were survival gear that Paddock never used.[91]\\r\\nThere have been several changes in the official account and timeline of Paddock's shooting of hotel security guard Campos. Police officials described these adjustments as \\"minute changes\\" that are common in complex investigations.[19]\\r\\nIn their first statement about the incident, police officials inaccurately reported that Campos arrived on the scene after Paddock began firing into the crowd. In a second statement, police officials reported, again inaccurately, that Campos was shot six minutes before Paddock began firing into the crowd. That report had been based on a 9:59?p.m. notation in a hotel security log, which in a third statement was determined to have been the time when Campos encountered the barricaded door.[18][20]\\r\\nSheriff Lombardo dismissed allegations that the changing timeline was the result of some kind of conspiracy between the police department, the FBI, and MGM Resorts International saying, \\"Nobody is attempting to hide anything in reference to this investigation. The dynamics and the size of this investigation requires us to go through voluminous amounts of information in order to draw an accurate picture.\\"[18]\\r\\nAlthough the investigation remains ongoing, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department released a preliminary report on the event on January 18, 2018.[4]\\r\\nPolice speculate that Paddock acted alone and have not determined his motive. No links have been identified to any hate groups, terrorist groups or ideologies, and he did not record a reason for his actions.[92]\\r\\nOn February 2, 2018, Douglas Haig, an Arizonan ammunition dealer, was charged in a Nevada federal court with \\"conspiracy to manufacture and sell armor-piercing ammunition without a license\\" after his fingerprints were discovered on unfired armor-piercing ammunition inside Paddock's suite.[93]\\r\\nTwenty-four firearms, a large quantity of ammunition, and numerous high-capacity magazines capable of holding up to 100 rounds apiece were found in the suite.[1][94][95] Fourteen of the firearms were .223-caliber AR-15-type semi-automatic rifles: three manufactured by Colt, two by Daniel Defense, two by FN Herstal, two by LWRC International, two by POF-USA, one with a .223 Wylde chamber by Christensen Arms, one made-to-order by LMT, and one by Noveske. The others were eight .308-caliber AR-10-type rifles, one .308-caliber Ruger American bolt-action rifle, and one .38-caliber Smith & Wesson Model 342 revolver.[1][96][97][98] The AR-15 rifles were fitted with vertical forward grips and bump fire stocks,[1][96] the latter of which allowed for recoil to actuate their triggers at a rate of 90 rounds in 10 seconds.[99] The AR-10 rifles were equipped with various telescopic sights and mounted on bipods.[1][100][101] The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that the firearms found in his hotel room, along with more guns found in his homes, had been legally purchased in Nevada, California, Texas, and Utah.[102] In the month preceding the shooting, he had attempted to purchase tracer ammunition, but the gun dealer he approached did not have the item in stock.[103] He bought tracer ammunition from a private seller at a Phoenix, Arizona gun show.[104]\\r\\nDuring subsequent investigations, ammonium nitrate (often used in improvised explosive devices) was found in the trunk of his Hyundai Tucson SUV, along with 1,600 rounds of ammunition and 50 pounds (23?kg) of Tannerite, a binary explosive used to make explosive targets for gun ranges.[105][106] Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said that while Paddock had \\"nefarious intent\\" with the material, he did not appear to have assembled an explosive device.[103][107]\\r\\nIn the hours and days after the shooting, false information and fake news about the shooter's identity and motive went viral on social media:\\r\\nGoogle and Facebook were criticized for displaying such false news stories in some of their search results.[111][118][119] The two technology companies were said to have failed in their responsibility of keeping false stories from reaching the public.[120] Facebook later said its algorithms were designed to detect and remove false stories, but failed to work adequately in this instance.[118]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, some media outlets reported that YouTube search results for information about the shooting returned links to conspiracy videos. YouTube stated that it had tweaked its search algorithm to promote news sources which it considered more authoritative.[121][122] Some experts have stated that the removal of this content ironically fuels conspiracy theories by making a cover-up seem evident.[123]\\r\\nSurvivors of the shooting have been accused of being paid actors, with some having received death threats on social media.[124]\\r\\nConspiracy theorist Alex Jones stated that \\"Vegas is as phony as a three dollar bill or as Obama's birth certificate.\\"[125] Conspiracy theorists claim that there were multiple shooters and that details of the massacre are being covered up for the sake of promoting gun control laws.[123]","input":"What hotel was the las vegas shooting at?"},{"output":"salpingo-oophorectomy","context":"Oophorectomy /?o?.?f??r?kt?mi/ (from Greek ???, oph܇ros, \\"egg-bearing\\" + ?ٶ?, ektom?, \\"a cutting out of\\") is the surgical removal of an ovary or ovaries. The surgery is also called ovariectomy, but this term has been traditionally used in basic science research to describe the surgical removal of ovaries in laboratory animals. Removal of the ovaries in women is the biological equivalent of castration in males; the term castration is only occasionally used in the medical literature to refer to oophorectomy in humans. In the veterinary sciences, the complete removal of the ovaries, oviducts, uterine horns, and the uterus is called overiohysterectomy a.k.a. spaying and is a form of sterilization.\\r\\nPartial oophorectomy or ovariotomy is a term sometimes used to describe a variety of surgeries such as ovarian cyst removal or resection of parts of the ovaries.[1] This kind of surgery is fertility-preserving, although ovarian failure may be relatively frequent. Most of the long-term risks and consequences of oophorectomy are not or only partially present with partial oophorectomy.\\r\\nIn humans, oophorectomy is most often performed because of diseases such as ovarian cysts or cancer; as prophylaxis to reduce the chances of developing ovarian cancer or breast cancer; or in conjunction with hysterectomy (removal of the uterus).\\r\\nThe removal of an ovary together with the Fallopian tube is called salpingo-oophorectomy or unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (USO). When both ovaries and both Fallopian tubes are removed, the term bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is used. Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy are not common forms of birth control in humans; more usual is tubal ligation, in which the Fallopian tubes are blocked but the ovaries remain intact. In many cases, surgical removal of the ovaries is performed concurrently with a hysterectomy. The formal medical name for removal of a woman's entire reproductive system (ovaries, Fallopian tubes, uterus) is \\"total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\\" (TAH-BSO); the more casual term for such a surgery is \\"ovariohysterectomy\\". \\"Hysterectomy\\" is removal of the uterus (from the Greek ??ϫ hystera \\"womb\\" and ٶ?ϫ ektomia \\"a cutting out of\\") without removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOophorectomy for benign causes is most often performed by abdominal laparoscopy. Abdominal laparotomy or robotic surgery is used in complicated cases or when a malignancy is suspected.\\r\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, 454,000 women in the United States underwent oophorectomy in 2004. The first successful operation of this type, account of which was published in the Eclectic Repertory and Analytic Review (Philadelphia) in 1817, was performed by Ephraim McDowell (1771-1830), a surgeon from Danville, Kentucky.[2] McDowell was dubbed as the \\"father of ovariotomy\\".[3][4] It later became known as Battey's Operation, after Robert Battey, a surgeon from Augusta, Georgia, who championed the procedure for a variety of conditions, most successfully for ovarian epilepsy.[5]\\r\\nMost bilateral oophorectomies (63%) are performed without any medical indication, most (87%) were performed together with a hysterectomy.[6] Conversely, unilateral oophorectomy is commonly performed for a medical indication (73%; cyst, endometriosis, benign tumor, inflammation, etc.) and less commonly in conjunction with hysterectomy (61%).[6]\\r\\nSpecial indications include several groups of women with substantially increased risk of ovarian cancer, such as high-risk BRCA mutation carriers and women with endometriosis who also suffer from frequent ovarian cysts.\\r\\nBilateral oophorectomy has been traditionally done in the belief that the benefit of preventing ovarian cancer would outweigh the risks associated with removal of ovaries. However, it is now clear that prophylactic oophorectomy without a reasonable medical indication decreases long-term survival rates substantially[7] and has deleterious long-term effects on health and well-being even in post-menopausal women.[8] The procedure has been postulated as a possible treatment method for female sex offenders.[9]\\r\\nOophorectomy can significantly improve survival for women with high-risk BRCA mutations, for whom prophylactic oophorectomy around age 40 reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancer and provides significant and substantial long-term survival advantage. On average, earlier intervention does not provide any additional benefit but increases risks and adverse effects.\\r\\nFor women with high-risk BRCA2 mutations, oophorectomy around age 40 has a relatively modest benefit for survival; the positive effect of reduced breast and ovarian cancer risk is nearly balanced by adverse effects. The survival advantage is more substantial when oophorectomy is performed together with prophylactic mastectomy.[10][11]\\r\\nIt is important to understand that the risks and benefits associated with oophorectomy in the BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population are different than those for the general population. Prophylactic risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is an important option for the high-risk population to consider. Women with BRCA1/2 mutations who undergo salpingo-oophorectomy have lower all-cause mortality rates than women in the same population who do not undergo this procedure. In addition, RRSO has been shown to decrease mortality specific to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Women who undergo RRSO are also at a lower risk for developing ovarian cancer and first occurrence breast cancer. Specifically, RRSO provides BRCA1 mutation carriers with no prior breast cancer a 70% reduction of ovarian cancer risk. BRCA1 mutation carriers with prior breast cancer can benefit from an 85% reduction. High-risk women who have not had prior breast cancer can benefit from a 37% (BRCA1 mutation) and 64% (BRCA2 mutation) reduction of breast cancer risk. These benefits are important to highlight, as they are unique to this BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population.[12]\\r\\nIn rare cases, oophorectomy can be used to treat endometriosis by eliminating the menstrual cycle, which will reduce or eliminate the spread of existing endometriosis as well as reducing pain. Since endometriosis results from an overgrowth of the uterine lining, removal of the ovaries as a treatment for endometriosis is often done in conjunction with a hysterectomy to further reduce or eliminate recurrence.\\r\\nOophorectomy for endometriosis is used only as last resort, often in conjunction with a hysterectomy, as it has severe side effects for women of reproductive age and a low success rate.\\r\\nPartial oophorectomy (i.e., ovarian cyst removal not involving total oophorectomy) is often used to treat milder cases of endometriosis when non-surgical hormonal treatments fail to stop cyst formation. Removal of ovarian cysts through partial oophorectomy is also used to treat extreme pelvic pain from chronic hormonal-related pelvic problems.\\r\\nOophorectomy is an intraabdominal surgery and serious complications stemming directly from the surgery are rare. When performed together with hysterectomy, it has influence on choice of surgical technique as the combined surgery is much less likely to be performed by vaginal hysterectomy.\\r\\nLaparotomic adnexal surgeries are associated with a high rate of adhesive small bowel obstructions (24%).[13]\\r\\nAn infrequent complication is injuring of the ureter at the level of the suspensory ligament of the ovary.[14]\\r\\nOophorectomy has serious long-term consequences stemming mostly from the hormonal effects of the surgery and extending well beyond menopause. The reported risks and adverse effects include premature death,[15][16] cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment or dementia,[17] parkinsonism,[18] osteoporosis and bone fractures, decline in psychological well-being,[19] and decline in sexual function. Hormone replacement therapy does not always reduce the adverse effects.[7]\\r\\nOophorectomy is associated with significantly increased all-cause long-term mortality except when performed for cancer prevention in carriers of high-risk BRCA mutations. This effect is particularly pronounced for women who undergo oophorectomy before age 45.[16]\\r\\nThe effect is not limited to women who have oophorectomy performed before menopause; an impact on survival is expected even for surgeries performed up to the age of 65.[20] Surgery at age 50-54 reduces the probability of survival until age 80 by 8% (from 62% to 54% survival), surgery at age 55-59 by 4%. Most of this effect is due to excess cardiovascular risk and hip fractures.[20]\\r\\nRemoval of ovaries causes hormonal changes and symptoms similar to, but generally more severe than, menopause. Women who have had an oophorectomy are usually encouraged to take hormone replacement drugs to prevent other conditions often associated with menopause. Women younger than 45 who have had their ovaries removed face a mortality risk 170% higher than women who have retained their ovaries.[16] Retaining the ovaries when a hysterectomy is performed is associated with better long-term survival.[15] Hormone therapy for women with oophorectomies performed before age 45 improves the long-term outcome and all-cause mortality rates.[16][21]\\r\\nWomen who have had bilateral oophorectomy surgeries lose most of their ability to produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone, and lose about half of their ability to produce testosterone, and subsequently enter what is known as \\"surgical menopause\\" (as opposed to normal menopause, which occurs naturally in women as part of the aging process). In natural menopause the ovaries generally continue to produce low levels of hormones, especially androgens, long after menopause, which may explain why surgical menopause is generally accompanied by a more sudden and severe onset of symptoms than natural menopause, symptoms that may continue until the natural age of menopause.[22] These symptoms are commonly addressed through hormone therapy, utilizing various forms of estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, or a combination.\\r\\nWhen the ovaries are removed, a woman is at a seven times greater risk of cardiovascular disease,[23][24][25][26][27] but the mechanisms are not precisely known. The hormone production of the ovaries currently cannot be sufficiently mimicked by drug therapy. The ovaries produce hormones a woman needs throughout her entire life, in the quantity they are needed, at the time they are needed, in response to and as part of the complex endocrine system.\\r\\nOophorectomy is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures.[28][29][30][31][32] A potential risk for oophorectomy performed after menopause is not fully elucidated.[33][34] Reduced levels of testosterone in women is predictive of height loss, which may occur as a result of reduced bone density.[35] In women under the age of 50 who have undergone oophorectomy, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is often used to offset the negative effects of sudden hormonal loss such as early-onset osteoporosis as well as menopausal problems like hot flushes that are usually more severe than those experienced by women undergoing natural menopause.\\r\\nOophorectomy substantially impairs sexuality.[36] Substantially more women who had both an oophorectomy and a hysterectomy reported libido loss, difficulty with sexual arousal, and vaginal dryness than those who had a less invasive procedure (either hysterectomy alone or an alternative procedure), and hormone replacement therapy was not found to improve these symptoms.[37] In addition, oophorectomy greatly reduces testosterone levels, which are associated with a greater sense of sexual desire in women.[38] However, at least one study has shown that psychological factors, such as relationship satisfaction, are still the best predictor of sexual activity following oophorectomy.[39] Sexual intercourse remains possible after oophorectomy and coitus can continue. Reconstructive surgery remains an option for women who have experienced benign and malignant conditions.[40] :1020ÿ1348\\r\\nThe side effects of oophorectomy may be alleviated by medicines other than hormonal replacement. Non-hormonal biphosphonates (such as Fosamax and Actonel) increase bone strength and are available as once-a-week pills. Low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as Paxil and Prozac alleviate vasomotor menopausal symptoms, i.e., \\"hot flashes\\".[41]\\r\\nIn general, hormone replacement therapy is somewhat controversial due to the known carcinogenic and thrombogenic properties of estrogen; however, many physicians and patients feel the benefits outweigh the risks in women who may face serious health and quality-of-life issues as a consequence of early surgical menopause. The ovarian hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are involved in the regulation of hundreds of bodily functions; it is believed by some doctors that hormone therapy programs mitigate surgical menopause side effects such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease,[42] and female sexual dysfunction.[43]\\r\\nShort-term hormone replacement with estrogen has negligible effect on overall mortality for high-risk BRCA mutation carriers. Based on computer simulations, overall mortality appears to be marginally higher for short-term HRT after oophorectomy or marginally lower for short-term HRT after oophorectomy in combination with mastectomy.[44] This result can probably be generalized to other women at high risk in whom short-term (i.e., one- or two-year) treatment with estrogen for hot flashes may be acceptable.","input":"What is the removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries?"},{"output":"the Polk High School","context":"Al Bundy is a fictional character and the essential protagonist of the U.S. television series Married... with Children, played by Ed O'Neill.[1] He is a misanthropic, working-class father of two, portrayed as a somewhat tragicomedic figure. Although he is a born loser who constantly laments his lot in life, he nevertheless stands by his family, displaying wit, self-sacrifice and resilience in times of crisis. He and his wife, Peg, were rated the 59th best characters on television by Bravo.\\r\\nIn a 2016 interview Ed O'Neill said that he based his interpretation of Al Bundy on one of his uncles.[2][better?source?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAl Bundy is a simple, working-class man, forever regretful of the turns his life has taken since the end of high school. He was a star running back on the Polk High School football team. However, marriage and a broken leg prevented him from attending university on a college football scholarship.\\r\\nAl is married to Peggy, whom he mistakenly asked to marry him while drunk. They have two children: Kelly, a promiscuous dumb blonde, and Bud, an intelligent but perpetually horny and unpopular schemer named after a brand of beer. In two separate episodes Peg refers to Al as Allen. Al lives in a suburb of Chicago and is the proud owner of a 1970s Dodge automobile (although the model shown occasionally on-screen is a Plymouth Duster, it is referred to throughout the series as simply \\"The Dodge\\"). He works as a shoe salesman at the fictional Gary's Shoes and Accessories for Today's Woman in the fictional New Market Mall. Al hates his job, loses it several times throughout the series, yet always ends up coming back to it. There is a running joke throughout the show that Al makes minimum-wage. However, in one episode, Al is offered early retirement and given a year's pay: $12,000, yet in another he says that after taxes and Peggy's spending he only gets one nickel out of every paycheck. In \\"My Mom, The Mom\\", Al states that he earns a 10% commission on each sale. In \\"Weenie Tot Lovers and Other Strangers\\", Peg states that his paycheck was for \\"80 pesos\\". The family also brought in income through game-shows, theft, various absurd schemes and mooching off of the Rhoades/D'Arcy's wealth throughout the series.\\r\\nThroughout the series, Al is continually saddled with massive debts caused by everything from the various disasters he becomes involved in to his wife's extravagant spending habits. However, he never appears to miss a mortgage payment or file for bankruptcy. The \\"Bundy Will\\", passed down from generation to generation as a punishment, indebted the \\"benefactor\\" with these debts that Al Bundy has incurred. In the episode \\"England Show I\\", it was stated that Al's ancestor Seamus McBundy insulted an obese witch, and brought a curse upon the fictional Bundy ancestral town of Lower Uncton in England.\\r\\nIn flashbacks, it is revealed that Al's mother may have been an alcoholic. While pondering his shortcomings over a toothpaste sandwich, he relives a moment where his mother tells him that he can become anything while audibly saying \\"Yeah right, Mom, try saying that when you're sober!\\" In a similar situation, he asks her if she wants her Bloody Mary. In one flashback episode, Al had an overdue library book for 30 years; he tries to get out of paying a $2,163.20 library fine by tricking the librarian (an old enemy of his) into believing that he had returned it years before, only to have his trick revealed on closed-circuit TV on Chicago television.\\r\\nMost of the show's running gags concern Al. Aside from his bad luck, Al also maintains a \\"do-it-yourself\\" attitude whenever something in the house needs repair. Combined with his creativity, poor judgement, and lack of skill, this usually produces absurd results, and often involves physical injury to Al. Al is also frequently described as being careless about hygiene: he is often told that he smells bad. He is often seen leaving restrooms, even public ones, with a newspaper tucked under his arm, to the sound of a toilet flushing. A running gag is that Al showers and brushes his teeth as rarely as he has sex, which is extremely infrequent, as he continually rejects and avoids Peggy's advances.\\r\\nAl is disliked by his neighbors. In \\"Route 666\\" Marcy D'Arcy said that when they thought Al had died, they all started dancing and singing \\"Ding dong, the shoe man's dead\\" and called it a \\"cruel, cruel hoax\\" when they learned it was a false alarm  as usual, Al had survived his latest misadventure. In another example of the neighborhood's distaste of Al during \\"You Better Shop Around\\", after he blacked out everyone's houses during a heatwave, the neighbors attempt to attack him with pitchforks and torches. Other people pay little to no attention to him and, as a result, his name often ends up misspelled on paychecks, reserved parking spots, etc. (e.g., \\"Bumby\\", \\"Boondy\\" or \\"Birdy\\").\\r\\nDespite being a somewhat phlegmatic and slow person, Bundy has a sarcastic and cynical sense of humor; he also has a definite love for his family. Examples can be seen on the rare occasions when he enjoys luxury and money. In one episode, Peggy and Al receive free first class plane tickets to New York City from Marcy. They are shown sipping champagne together and singing \\"I Got You, Babe\\". In another episode, Al's Dodge turns up missing and the only reason that he wants it back is to recover an item in the trunk. The item turns out to be a family photo of Al, Peg, Kelly and Bud together. This suggests that his distaste for them is spawned merely by his disappointment in his extremely poor quality of life.\\r\\nAl dislikes fat women and repeatedly insults them to their faces with one-liners, a behavior he has engaged in since he was a child. He also hates his job, the prospect of having sex with his wife, his feminist neighbor Marcy, and the French. He loves nudie magazines, free beer, bowling and \\"nudie\\" bars, and often cherishes the glory moment of his past: scoring four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the fictional Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus fictional Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, \\"Spare Tire\\" Dixon (played by Bubba Smith in the episode \\"All-Nite Security Dude\\"). Another episode \\"Damn Bundys\\" featured Al selling his soul to the devil (played by Robert Englund) in order to lead the Chicago Bears to the Super Bowl[3] as the oldest rookie in NFL history; Al scores the touchdown and ends up in hell with his family and neighbors for 300 years. (In real life, O'Neill, a college football standout, tried out for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1969, the first season of Hall of Famers Chuck Noll and \\"Mean Joe\\" Greene, but was cut in training camp, leading to O'Neill re-enrolling at Youngstown State University and starting his acting career there).[4] In the Season 8 episode \\"Dud Bowl II\\", a scoreboard at Polk High's football stadium was to be dedicated to Al, but Marcy had arranged for it to instead be named after Terry Bradshaw (who says later in the episode that he never played football while attending Polk High) out of malice; but after hearing from Kelly how much it would mean to her father if the scoreboard honored him, Bradshaw decides to let the scoreboard to be named after Al. Al did not know this and he arranged to have Jefferson and Bud blow up the scoreboard.\\r\\nHe is a fan of oldies music, and a fan of westerns. His favorite movie is Hondo (which he missed once in the episode \\"Assault and Batteries\\", after having been knocked unconscious when a cash register he threw at an automatic door in frustration bounced off the door and hit him in the head), and his favorite sitcom is the fictional Psycho Dad (he led an unsuccessful protest to have the show put back on the air after it was canceled due to its violent content, leading Al and his NO MA'AM organization members to go to Washington, D.C.). Politically, Al appears to have mixed views with a somewhat conservative outlook (various episodes depict him as mocking Rush Limbaugh, whereas others show him as a huge fan of John Wayne, in particular his movie Hondo). He is an ardent admirer of President Dwight D Eisenhower, and he often battles his feminist neighbor Marcy, but later in an homage to his time as Al Bundy, Ed O'Neill reprised the role of Al showing his support for the then-candidate, Barack Obama's tax plan, however this was not part of the official canon. The plan was said to give \\"Al the Shoe Salesman\\" a $1,000 federal tax break. Bundy's favorite magazine is Big'uns, though an early episode used an issue of Playboy instead. He enjoys watching sports and adult movies on television, with his right hand tucked into his waistband (he switches to his left hand on Sundays). Though he almost always resists Peggy's frequent amorous advances, he is shown to have a particular fondness for her breasts, which she refers to as \\"the guys\\".\\r\\nAl's talents include bowling (he is an extremely gifted bowler), barbecueing (while wearing an apron that says \\"Kiss the Cook, Kill the Wife\\"), and getting into and winning fistfights. He can survive incredible injuries ranging from falling off his roof while installing a satellite dish, getting shocked by that same dish, and being pulverized by a massive woman wrestler (Big Bad Mama from Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling) in Las Vegas, to jumping from an airplane without a parachute, and surviving a huge explosion when he accidentally detonates dynamite in his own yard trying to kill a rabbit who has been eating his vegetable garden.\\r\\nAl Bundy had a highly positive reception. A lot of the praise went to O'Neill's portrayal of the character.[5][6] Al and Peg were named the 59th best TV characters by Bravo.[7]","input":"What football team did al bundy play for?"},{"output":"Euclid","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nEuclid (/?ju?kl?d/; Ancient Greek: ??Ѵ? ÿ Eukleds, pronounced?[eu?.kl?.d??s]; fl. 300 BC), sometimes given the name Euclid of Alexandria[1] to distinguish him from Euclides of Megara, was a Greek mathematician, often referred to as the \\"founder of geometry\\"[1] or the \\"father of geometry\\". He was active in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy?I (323ÿ283 BC). His Elements is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics (especially geometry) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century.[2][3][4] In the Elements, Euclid deduced the theorems of what is now called Euclidean geometry from a small set of axioms. Euclid also wrote works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, number theory, and rigor.\\r\\n\\r\\nEuclid is the anglicized version of the Greek name ??Ѵ?, which means \\"renowned, glorious\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nVery few original references to Euclid survive, so little is known about his life. He was likely born c. 325 BC, although the place and circumstances of both his birth and death are unknown and may only be estimated roughly relative to other people mentioned with him. He is rarely mentioned by name by other Greek mathematicians from Archimedes (c.?287 BC ÿ c.?212 BC) onward, and is usually referred to as \\"? ??\\" (\\"the author of Elements\\").[6] The few historical references to Euclid were written centuries after he lived, by Pappus of Alexandria c. 320 AD and Proclus c. 450 AD.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nA detailed biography of Euclid is given by Arabian authors, mentioning, for example, a birth town of Tyre. This biography is generally believed to be fictitious.[8] If he came from Alexandria, he would have known the Serapeum of Alexandria, and the Library of Alexandria, and may have worked there during his time.\\r\\n\\r\\nEuclid's arrival in Alexandria came about ten years after its founding by Alexander the Great (356 BC ÿ 323 BC), which means he arrived c. 322 BC.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nProclus introduces Euclid only briefly in his Commentary on the Elements. According to Proclus, Euclid supposedly belonged to Plato's \\"persuasion\\" and brought together the Elements, drawing on prior work of Eudoxus of Cnidus and of several pupils of Plato (particularly Theaetetus and Philip of Opus.) Proclus believes that Euclid is not much younger than these, and that he must have lived during the time of Ptolemy I because he was mentioned by Archimedes (287ÿ212?BC). Although the apparent citation of Euclid by Archimedes has been judged to be an interpolation by later editors of his works, it is still believed that Euclid wrote his works before those of Archimedes.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nProclus later retells a story that, when Ptolemy I asked if there was a shorter path to learning geometry than Euclid's Elements, \\"Euclid replied there is no royal road to geometry.\\"[11] This anecdote is questionable since it is similar to a story told about Menaechmus and Alexander the Great.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the only other key reference to Euclid, Pappus briefly mentioned in the fourth century that Apollonius \\"spent a very long time with the pupils of Euclid at Alexandria, and it was thus that he acquired such a scientific habit of thought\\" c. 247ÿ222?BC.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nEuclid died c. 270 BC, presumably in Alexandria.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the lack of biographical information is unusual for the period (extensive biographies are available for most significant Greek mathematicians for several centuries before and after Euclid), some researchers have proposed that Euclid was not, in fact, a historical character and that his works were written by a team of mathematicians who took the name Euclid from the historical character Euclid of Megara (compare Bourbaki). However, this hypothesis is not well accepted by scholars and there is little evidence in its favor.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough many of the results in Elements originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent framework, making it easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no mention of Euclid in the earliest remaining copies of the Elements, and most of the copies say they are \\"from the edition of Theon\\" or the \\"lectures of Theon\\",[18] while the text considered to be primary, held by the Vatican, mentions no author. The only reference that historians rely on of Euclid having written the Elements was from Proclus, who briefly in his Commentary on the Elements ascribes Euclid as its author.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough best known for its geometric results, the Elements also includes number theory. It considers the connection between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes (known as the EuclidÿEuler theorem), the infinitude of prime numbers, Euclid's lemma on factorization (which leads to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic on uniqueness of prime factorizations), and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe geometrical system described in the Elements was long known simply as geometry, and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, that system is often referred to as Euclidean geometry to distinguish it from other so-called non-Euclidean geometries that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29 (P. Oxy. 29) is a fragment of the second book of the Elements of Euclid, unearthed by Grenfell and Hunt 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. More recent scholarship suggests a date of 75ÿ125 AD.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe classic translation of T. L. Heath, reads:[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a straight line be cut into equal and unequal segments, the rectangle contained by the unequal segments of the whole together with the square on the straight line between the points of section is equal to the square on the half.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the Elements, at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day. They follow the same logical structure as Elements, with definitions and proved propositions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid spacecraft was named in his honor.[22]","input":"Who is regarded as the father of geometry?"},{"output":"Wright brothers","context":"","input":"Who invented the first aeroplane in the world?"},{"output":"The Crime Investigation Department (????? ???? ?????)

For balloons, helicopters and some specialized fixed-wing aircraft (VTOL aircraft such as the Harrier), no runway is needed.  Takeoff is the opposite of landing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor light aircraft, usually full power is used during takeoff. Large transport category (airliner) aircraft may use a reduced power for takeoff, where less than full power is applied in order to prolong engine life, reduce maintenance costs and reduce noise emissions. In some emergency cases, the power used can then be increased to increase the aircraft's performance. Before takeoff, the engines, particularly piston engines, are routinely run up at high power to check for engine-related problems. The aircraft is permitted to accelerate to rotation speed (often referred to as Vr). The term rotation is used because the aircraft pivots around the axis of its main landing gear while still on the ground, usually because of manipulation of the flight controls to make this change in aircraft attitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nose is raised to a nominal 5ÿ15 nose up pitch attitude to increase lift from the wings and effect liftoff. For most aircraft, attempting a takeoff without a pitch-up would require cruise speeds while still on the runway.\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed-wing aircraft designed for high-speed operation (such as commercial jet aircraft) have difficulty generating enough lift at the low speeds encountered during takeoff. These are therefore fitted with high-lift devices, often including slats and usually flaps, which increase the camber and often area of the wing, making it more effective at low speed, thus creating more lift. These are deployed from the wing before takeoff, and retracted during the climb. They can also be deployed at other times, such as before landing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speeds needed for takeoff are relative to the motion of the air (indicated airspeed). A headwind will reduce the ground speed needed for takeoff, as there is a greater flow of air over the wings. Typical takeoff air speeds for jetliners are in the 130ÿ155 knot range (150ÿ180?mph, 240ÿ285?km/h). Light aircraft, such as a Cessna 150, take off at around 55 knots (63?mph, 100?km/h). Ultralights have even lower takeoff speeds. For a given aircraft, the takeoff speed is usually dependent on the aircraft weight; the heavier the weight, the greater the speed needed.[1] Some aircraft are specifically designed for short takeoff and landing (STOL), which they achieve by becoming airborne at very low speeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe takeoff speed required varies with air density, aircraft gross weight, and aircraft configuration (flap or slat position, as applicable). Air density is affected by factors such as field elevation and air temperature. This relationship between temperature, altitude, and air density can be expressed as a density altitude, or the altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere at which the air density would be equal to the actual air density.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperations with transport category aircraft employ the concept of the takeoff V-Speeds, V1, VR and V2. These speeds are determined not only by the above factors affecting takeoff performance, but also by the length and slope of the runway and any peculiar conditions, such as obstacles off the end of the runway. Below V1, in case of critical failures, the takeoff should be aborted; above V1 the pilot continues the takeoff and returns for landing. After the co-pilot calls V1, he/she will call VR or \\"rotate,\\" marking speed at which to rotate the aircraft. The VR for transport category aircraft is calculated such as to allow the aircraft to reach the regulatory screen height at V2 with one engine failed. Then, V2 (the safe takeoff speed) is called. This speed must be maintained after an engine failure to meet performance targets for rate of climb and angle of climb.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a single-engine or light twin-engine aircraft, the pilot calculates the length of runway required to take off and clear any obstacles, to ensure sufficient runway to use for takeoff. A safety margin can be added to provide the option to stop on the runway in case of a rejected takeoff. In most such aircraft, any engine failure results in a rejected takeoff as a matter of course, since even overrunning the end of the runway is preferable to lifting off with insufficient power to maintain flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf an obstacle needs to be cleared, the pilot climbs at the speed for maximum climb angle (Vx), which results in the greatest altitude gain per unit of horizontal distance travelled. If no obstacle needs to be cleared, or after an obstacle is cleared, the pilot can accelerate to the best rate of climb speed (Vy), where the aircraft will gain the most altitude in the least amount of time. Generally speaking, Vx is a lower speed than Vy, and requires a higher pitch attitude to achieve.\\r\\nNormally ground speed for takeoff varies between 250 km/h to 475 km/h in just 2.94/s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssisted takeoff is any system for helping aircraft into the air (as opposed to strictly under its own power). The reason it might be needed is due to the aircraft's weight exceeding the normal maximum takeoff weight, insufficient power, or the available runway length may be insufficient, or a hot and high airfield, or a combination of all four factors. Assisted takeoff is also required for gliders, which do not have an engine and so are unable to take off by themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nVertical takeoff refers to aircraft or rockets that take off in a vertical trajectory. Vertical takeoff eliminates the need for airfields. Most vertical take off aircraft are also able to land horizontally, but there were certain rocket-powered aircraft of the Luftwaffe that only took off vertically, landing in other ways. The Bachem Ba 349 Natter landed under a parachute after having taken off vertically. Other late Third Reich projects, such as the Heinkel P.1077 Julia or the Focke-Wulf Volksj?ger 2 climbed to their ceiling at a nearly vertical angle and landed later on a skid.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nVertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft include fixed-wing aircraft that can hover, take off and land vertically as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors, such as tiltrotors.[3][4][5][6]  Some VTOL aircraft can operate in other modes as well, such as CTOL (conventional take-off and landing), STOL (short take-off and landing), and/or STOVL (short take-off and vertical landing). Others, such as some helicopters, can only operate by VTOL, due to the aircraft lacking landing gear that can handle horizontal motion. VTOL is a subset of V/STOL (vertical and/or short take-off and landing).\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the helicopter, there are two types of VTOL aircraft in military service: craft using a tiltrotor, such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, and some aircraft using directed jet thrust such as the Harrier family.\\r\\n\\r\\nA rocket launch is the takeoff phase of the flight of a rocket. Launches for orbital spaceflights, or launches into interplanetary space, are usually from a fixed location on the ground, but may also be from a floating platform such as the San Marco platform, or the Sea Launch launch vessel.","input":"How fast does a plane need to take off?"},{"output":"Let the good times roll","context":"The expression Laissez les bons temps rouler (alternatively Laissez le bon temps rouler, Laisser les bons temps rouler and Laisser le bon temps rouler, French pronunciation:??[l?se le b?? t? ?ule]) is a Cajun French phrase that is literally translated from the English expression \\"Let the good times roll.\\"\\r\\nThis phrase is often mentioned in Louisiana and around the Gulf Coast where Mardi Gras is celebrated.

The series aired locally in Los Angeles for four years, from 1951 to 1955, then nationally for another 27 years on ABC from 1955 to 1971, and in first-run syndication from 1971 to 1982. Repeat episodes are broadcast in the United States by Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) stations. These airings incorporate an original programusually, a color broadcast from 1965 through 1982in its entirety. In place of the commercials, newer performance and interview clips from the original stars and/or a family member of the performers are included; these clips are occasionally updated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 11, 1951, The Lawrence Welk Show began as a local program on KTLA in Los Angeles, the flagship station of the Paramount Television Network and the first television station in California.[1] The original show was broadcast from the since-demolished Aragon Ballroom at Venice Beach.\\r\\nThe show made its national television debut on ABC Television on July 2, 1955,[2] and was initially produced at the Hollywood Palladium,[3][4] moving to the ABC studios at Prospect and Talmadge in Hollywood shortly afterwards. For 23 of its 27 years on the air, the show would originate there. The only seasons not produced there were 1965ÿ66, 1976ÿ77 at the Hollywood Palace and CBS Television City from 1977 to 1979.\\r\\nThe 1965-66 season was taped at the Hollywood Palace because that was ABC's only West Coast TV studio at the time equipped for live or taped color production; Welk had insisted that the show go color in 1965 because he believed that being broadcast in color was critical to the continued success of his program. Once a couple of studios at the ABC Prospect and Talmadge facilities had been converted to color in 1966, the show moved back there.\\r\\nThe show aired on ABC until 1971. When the show was cancelled by the head of programming there, Welk formed his own production company and continued airing the show, on local stations and, often from 7 to 8 P.M. Eastern Time on Saturdays over some of the ABC affiliates on which he had previously appeared, along with some stations affiliated with other networks. The syndicated version of the program aired from 1971 to 1982.\\r\\nWhen the show debuted nationwide, The Lawrence Welk Show was billed as the Dodge Dancing Party in 1955 and 1956. From 1956 to 1959, Lawrence Welk was broadcast two nights per week. The second show's title was Lawrence Welk Presents Top Tunes and New Talent (1956ÿ58) and then Lawrence Welk's Plymouth Show, after another Chrysler vehicle (1958ÿ59). The Plymouth show was the first American television program to air in stereophonic sound. Due to the fact that stereophonic television had not yet been invented (it would be 25 more years before it would become standard), ABC instead simulcast the show on its radio network, with the TV side airing one audio channel and the radio side airing the other; viewers would tune in both the TV and the radio to achieve the stereophonic effect.[5][6] Starting with the 1959ÿ60 season the two shows were merged into The Lawrence Welk Show, reverting to monophonic broadcasts. The name stuck, and it became the most popular variety show ever.\\r\\nThe primary sponsor of The Lawrence Welk Show was Dodge (automobile maker), later to be followed by Geritol (a multivitamin), Sominex (sleep aid), Aqua Velva (aftershave), Serutan (laxative), Universal Appliances (manufacturer of home appliances), Polident (a denture cleanser), Ocean Spray (fruit juice) and Sinclair Oil (automobile fuel) served as associate sponsors for a short time.[7] (During later years, a number of Welk cast members appeared in commercials for many of the show's sponsors, filmed specifically to air during Welk broadcasts.)\\r\\nWhile the show was highly rated and continued to attract more audiences, ABC canceled it in 1971 for two reasons. The first was that the network had to cut three-and-a-half hours a week of prime-time programming, owing to the institution of the Prime Time Access Rule in 1971; the other was the fact that Welk's viewership was mostly of people over forty-five, mostly because of the music he chose to play, but also because younger viewers, the core viewing target that networks coveted, were either out during the Saturday night slot, or were watching one of the other networks.[8] Over the course of the early 1970s, several variety shows (including Welk's, but ranging from long-running series such as The Ed Sullivan Show, The Hollywood Palace and The Red Skelton Show to more contemporary shows such as Hee Haw, The Johnny Cash Show and This Is Tom Jones) were pulled from network schedules (particularly ABC and CBS) in a demographic move known colloquially as the \\"rural purge\\".\\r\\nIn response to ABC's move, Welk started his own production company and continued producing the show for syndication. Some independent stations put it in its old Saturday timeslot, and in many cases, it drew higher ratings than the network shows scheduled at that time. In many markets, the syndicated Lawrence Welk aired before the start of network prime-time on Saturday nights (7 p.m. Eastern Time); also in many areas, it competed against another show that was cancelled by CBS and resurrected in syndication, also in 1971? Hee Haw. Welk's program was among a group of syndicated niche programs, others including Hee Haw and Soul Train, that flourished during this era. (The success of Lawrence Welk and Hee Haw in syndication, and the network decisions that led to their respective cancellations, were the inspiration for a novelty song called \\"The Lawrence Welk-Hee Haw Counter-Revolution Polka\\", performed by Roy Clark, one of the co-stars of Hee Haw.)\\r\\nWelk retired in 1982; at the time of his retirement, he was 79 years old, making him at the time the oldest host of a regularly scheduled entertainment television series (a feat later surpassed by Bob Barker in 2003 and later by Betty White in 2012). Classic shows? largely, from 1967 to 1982? were repackaged with new footage (either Welk or the show's cast introducing segments) for syndication during the 1982ÿ1983 season as Memories with Lawrence Welk, after which they were withdrawn from distribution for a short time. In 1985, The Lawrence Welk Christmas Reunion was produced. It was the last show in which Welk appeared with the \\"musical family\\".\\r\\nThe Oklahoma Educational Television Authority acquired the broadcast rights to the series in 1986. In order to introduce the show to a new generation, they produced a documentary film, Lawrence Welk: Television's Music Man, hosted by Kathy Lennon of The Lennon Sisters. The film was a retrospective on Welk's life and career, featuring interviews with surviving members of Welk's \\"musical family\\", and scenes from the show. After its airing, reformatted versions of the Welk show were released to public television stations. Welk's segments from Memories with Lawrence Welk were used until his death, after which select members of the \\"musical family\\" took over as hosts. Reruns continue to air to this day (in many markets airing on Saturday nights at 7?pm, the same time the show aired during the latter years of its original run), with new and updated interviews with surviving cast members (Mary Lou Metzger hosts wraparounds that feature interviews, while Bobby Burgess currently hosts the ones that do not).[9] The shows are occasionally \\"recut\\" and interspersed with segments from other episodes for time and diversity purposes; for example, a rebroadcast of Gail Farrell's 1969 debut actually featured an added song by Anacani, who hadn't joined the show until 1973.\\r\\nThe show was a top 30 hit for five seasons, according to ClassicTVHits.com's ratings database.\\r\\nThe show would often open by showing bubbles floating around and was accompanied by a sound effect of a bottle of champagne opening, including the opening theme (\\"Bubbles in the Wine\\", composed by Welk and Frank Loesser). Each week, Welk would introduce the theme of the show, which usually inspired joyous singing and/or patriotic fervor. He was most known for delivering these monologues in a distinctive German accent (this despite being born and raised in North Dakota), which was parodied in popular culture (even by Welk himself: the two books he authored, Wunnerful, Wunnerful! and Ah-One, Ah-Two! were so titled because they were his catchphrases). This was evident from his mispronunciations of script on cue cards. On one such story, related by Jo Ann Castle on the Mike Douglas Show,[citation needed] has him introducing a medley of World War I tunes as \\"songs from World War Eye\\". Also, from his autobiography Wunnerful, Wunnerful! he bemoans his accent, and in some of his pronunciations of \\"wonderful\\" in the show he can be heard forcing the D.\\r\\nIf the number was more of a dance tune, Welk would frequently dance with ladies from the audience, for which he became somewhat known. For certain songs (mainly the instrumentals performed by the orchestra), the couples in attendance were also allowed to dance at the Ballroom. Many of the show's songs were performed as part of a skit; while a handful of skits were common throughout the show's run, during a short period in mid-1970s (about the same time The Semonski Sisters were featured performers on the show), the show consisted almost entirely of them.\\r\\nWelk often demonstrated multiple times on-camera how the champagne bottle sound was created, by placing a finger in his mouth, releasing it to make the popping sound, and making a soft hissing sound to simulate the bubbles escaping the bottle. One such instance is part of the opening sequence of the public television reruns seen today.\\r\\nWelk frequently had performers sing and play standards from the big band era and the first half of the 20th century. He had a particular admiration for those composers contemporary with him, such as Hoagy Carmichael, Henry Mancini, Johnny Mercer, Cole Porter, and Harry Warren; although the show's repertoire was in reality much broader, and would often include pop songs from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970sWelk even devoted an entire show to the music of the 1970s in 1978as well as country music, patriotic music, and religious music, especially if it was thought to appeal to older listeners (and, as Welk stated in 1956, \\"as long as it's done in the champagne style\\"). In one of his most infamous incidents, he asked singers Gail Farrell and Dick Dale to perform Brewer & Shipley's hit song \\"One Toke Over the Line\\" (a mock gospel tune riddled with drug references) as a modern spiritual, apparently oblivious to the meaning of the word \\"toke.\\"[10] Brewer responded that although it was \\"absurd\\", the duo \\"got more publicity than we could pay for\\" from the out-of-place performance.[11] Welk, for his part, blamed ABC for pressuring him into including the song, among others he felt did not fit the show's format.[12]\\r\\nThe closing theme during the syndicated years, often performed by the \\"Musical Family\\", was \\"Adios, Au Revoir, Auf Wiedersehen\\" (composed by George Cates). A recording of the song has been edited over the updated credits on PBS reruns.\\r\\nWelk employed many musicians and singers, which were known in the press as his \\"Musical Family\\". Most members of the Musical Family had specific, well-defined roles within the context of the show, generally specializing in one type of performance (for instance, the show had two pianists, but one would specialize in ragtime piano while the other would handle easy listening pieces; the show's numerous singers and dancers were similarly typecast). One of the most prominent positions in the Musical Family was the \\"Champagne Lady\\", who always sang a down-tempo solo number toward the end of each show.\\r\\nThese musicians were bound by an unofficial set of morals (artistic and personal) dictated by Welk, and if he believed the audience did not find them wholesome enough, they would be fired. Former \\"Champagne Lady\\" Alice Lon was fired in 1959 for crossing her legs on a desk, which angered Welk. After he fired Lon, thousands of letters filled the ABC mailroom, demanding an apology, and that she be rehired. Welk tried to get Lon back but she refused.[13]\\r\\nIn later years however, it was revealed that along with the \\"cheesecake\\" incident, another one of the reasons for Lon's departure was money; she was supporting three young sons and wanted a raise. A further reason was a dispute over what kind of songs she would be singing, and since Welk insisted on playing what he felt his audiences wanted to hear, generally older \\"standards\\", she rebelled against such restrictions.\\r\\nAfter two years and a string of short-lived vocalists, Norma Zimmer was hired, starting in 1960. Zimmer stayed with Welk for the rest of the show's run.\\r\\nAnother example of being bound by Welk's set of morals was famed clarinetist Pete Fountain, renowned for his New Orleans-style jazz. He was a valued member of the Welk cast, who was rumored to have quit when Welk objected to his efforts to \\"jazz up\\" the Christmas standard \\"Silver Bells\\" on the 1958 Christmas show. In an interview, Fountain admitted he left Welk because \\"Champagne and bourbon don't mix.\\"[14] (The departure was amicable; Fountain would reappear in Welk reunion shows after the show ended.)\\r\\nWelk relied on fan letters to tell him who was popular and who was not. Often, performers who received a positive reaction were prominently featured on future shows, while those who did not meet muster with the audience saw their solo opportunities diminish and sometimes were eventually let go.\\r\\nAmong the performers that were wildly popular with audiences during the years it was on ABC were The Lennon Sisters, Joe Feeney, Steve Smith, Larry Hooper, Jo Ann Castle and electric guitarist Buddy Merrill, just to name a few. Lynn Anderson, Clay Hart, and Ava Barber used the show as a springboard to launch their own successful careers as country music solo artists. At the height of the show's popularity, members of the Musical Family were featured in several celebrity tabloid magazines alongside other mainstream television and movie stars.[15]\\r\\nTap dancer Arthur Duncan became the second African-American to appear regularly on a sponsored television variety program, and the first since 1951, when he was hired as a permanent music maker by Welk in 1964. (The first was Teddy Wilson, a regular band member on the short-lived Star Time throughout its 1950ÿ51 run.)\\r\\nJames Hobson (also known as Jim Hobson) served longest as producer (1962ÿ1982) and director of The Lawrence Welk Show.[16] Hobson died on April 26, 2013, in Santa Monica Hospital, California.\\r\\nThe surviving episodes from the first 10 seasons on ABC, which began in 1955, exist today as black and white kinescopes or videotape, as the show was broadcast live for the first 10 years, right up through the 1964ÿ1965 season. A few of these have been broadcast on public television. Nearly all episodes shown on PBS stations today are from around 1965 to 1982 (the majority being from the syndicated run), but some older black and white segments can be found on YouTube and in recent months more black-and-white episodes have been added into the rotation.\\r\\nBeginning with the 1965ÿ1966 season, the episodes were recorded in color. It is assumed the color episodes exist intact.[citation needed] The very first color episode of the show, which aired in September 1965, was taped on-location at the Escondido resort near San Diego, in which Welk had a financial and ownership interest. It is occasionally shown on PBS stations; the PBS rebroadcast is introduced by Bobby Burgess.\\r\\nNeither the Welk Organization nor the OETA have released any episodes of The Lawrence Welk Show on home video, nor are there any plans to do so. Welk Musical Family specials, however, are available on DVD, and can be obtained with a donation during reairs on local PBS stations.\\r\\nAll of these singers and performers were part of the Music Family, with Welk on the lead.\\r\\nRose Weiss was the long-term Welk costume designer and manager.","input":"When did the lawrence welk show first air?"},{"output":"WinStar World Casino and Resort","context":"WinStar World Casino and Resort is a hotel and casino located near the OklahomaÿTexas state line, 1 mile (1.6?km) north of the Red River, at Exit 1 and Exit 3 off Interstate 35 in Thackerville, Oklahoma.

This fungus grows on rye and related plants, and produces alkaloids that can cause ergotism in humans and other mammals who consume grains contaminated with its fruiting structure (called ergot sclerotium).[2][3]\\r\\nClaviceps includes about 50 known species, mostly in the tropical regions. Economically significant species include C. purpurea (parasitic on grasses and cereals), C. fusiformis (on pearl millet, buffel grass), C. paspali (on dallis grass), C. africana[4] (on sorghum), and C. lutea (on paspalum).[5] C. purpurea most commonly affects outcrossing species such as rye (its most common host), as well as triticale, wheat and barley. It affects oats only rarely.\\r\\nC. purpurea has at least three races or varieties, which differ in their host specificity:[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ergot kernel, called a sclerotium, develops when a spore of fungal species of the genus Claviceps infects a floret of flowering grass or cereal. The infection process mimics a pollen grain growing into an ovary during fertilization. Infection requires that the fungal spore have access to the stigma; consequently, plants infected by Claviceps are mainly outcrossing species with open flowers, such as rye (Secale cereale) and ryegrasses (genus Lolium). The proliferating fungal mycelium then destroys the plant ovary and connects with the vascular bundle originally intended for seed nutrition. The first stage of ergot infection manifests itself as a white soft tissue (known as sphacelia) producing sugary honeydew, which often drops out of the infected grass florets. This honeydew contains millions of asexual spores (conidia), which insects disperse to other florets. Later, the sphacelia convert into a hard dry sclerotium inside the husk of the floret. At this stage, alkaloids and lipids accumulate in the sclerotium.\\r\\nClaviceps species from tropic and subtropic regions produce macro- and microconidia in their honeydew. Macroconidia differ in shape and size between the species, whereas microconidia are rather uniform, oval to globose (5x3m). Macroconidia are able to produce secondary conidia. A germ tube emerges from a macroconidium through the surface of a honeydew drop and a secondary conidium of an oval to pearlike shape is formed, to which the contents of the original macroconidium migrates. Secondary conidia form a white, frost-like surface on honeydew drops and spread via the wind. No such process occurs in Claviceps purpurea, Claviceps grohii, Claviceps nigricans, and Claviceps zizaniae, all from northern temperate regions.\\r\\nWhen a mature sclerotium drops to the ground, the fungus remains dormant until proper conditions (such as the onset of spring or a rain period) trigger its fruiting phase . It germinates, forming one or several fruiting bodies with heads and stipes, variously coloured (resembling a tiny mushroom). In the head, threadlike sexual spores form, which are ejected simultaneously when suitable grass hosts are flowering. Ergot infection causes a reduction in the yield and quality of grain and hay, and if livestock eat infected grain or hay it may cause a disease called ergotism.\\r\\nBlack and protruding sclerotia of C. purpurea are well known. However, many tropical ergots have brown or greyish sclerotia, mimicking the shape of the host seed. For this reason, the infection is often overlooked.\\r\\nInsects, including flies and moths, carry conidia of Claviceps species, but it is unknown whether insects play a role in spreading the fungus from infected to healthy plants.[7]\\r\\nThe evolution of plant parasitism in the Clavicipitaceae dates back at least 100 million years, to the early-mid Cretaceous. An amber fossil discovered in 2014 preserves a grass spikelet and an ergot-like parasitic fungus. The fossil shows that the original hosts of the Clavicipitaceae could have been grasses. The discovery also establishes a minimum time for the conceivable presence of psychotropic compounds in fungi.[8][9] Several evolutionary processes have acted to diversify the array of ergot alkaloids produced by fungi; these differences in enzyme activities are evident at the levels of substrate specificity (LpsA), product specification (EasA, CloA) or both (EasG and possibly CloA).[10] The old yellow enzyme, EasA, presents an outstanding example. This enzyme catalyzes reduction of the C8=C9 double-bond in chanoclavine I, but EasA isoforms differ in whether they subsequently catalyze reoxidation of C8ÿC9 after rotation.[10] This difference distinguishes most Clavicipitaceae from Trichocomaceae, but in Clavicipitaceae it is also the key difference dividing the branch of classical ergot alkaloids from dihydroergot alkaloids, the latter often being preferred for pharmaceuticals due to their relatively few side effects.[10]\\r\\nThe ergot sclerotium contains high concentrations (up to 2% of dry mass) of the alkaloid ergotamine, a complex molecule consisting of a tripeptide-derived cyclol-lactam ring connected via amide linkage to a lysergic acid (ergoline) moiety, and other alkaloids of the ergoline group that are biosynthesized by the fungus.[11] Ergot alkaloids have a wide range of biological activities including effects on circulation and neurotransmission.[12]\\r\\nErgot alkaloids are classified as:\\r\\nErgotism is the name for sometimes severe pathological syndromes affecting humans or other animals that have ingested plant material containing ergot alkaloid, such as ergot-contaminated grains. The Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony, an order of monks established in 1095, specialized in treating ergotism victims[14] with balms containing tranquilizing and circulation-stimulating plant extracts.The common name for ergotism is \\"St. Anthony's Fire\\",[14] in reference to this order of monks and the severe burning sensations in the limbs which was one of the symptoms.[15] There are two types of ergotism, the first is characterized by muscle spasms, fever and hallucinations and the victims may appear dazed, be unable to speak, become manic, or have other forms of paralysis or tremors, and suffer from hallucinations and other distorted perceptions.[16] This is caused by serotonergic stimulation of the central nervous system by some of the alkaloids.[16] The second type of ergotism is marked by violent burning, peripheral pulses and shooting pain of the poorly vascularized distal organs, such as the fingers and toes,[16] and are caused by effects of ergot alkaloids on the vascular system due to vasoconstriction, sometimes leading to gangrene and loss of limbs due to severely restricted blood circulation.\\r\\nThe neurotropic activities of the ergot alkaloids may also cause hallucinations and attendant irrational behaviour, convulsions, and even death.[11][12] Other symptoms include strong uterine contractions, nausea, seizures, high fever, vomiting, loss of muscle strength and unconsciousness. Since the Middle Ages, controlled doses of ergot were used to induce abortions and to stop maternal bleeding after childbirth.[17] Klotz offers a detailed overview of the toxicities in mammalian livestock, stating that the activities are attributable to antagonism or agonism of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. As well, he shares that the adrenergic blockage by ergopeptines (e.g., ergovaline or ergotamine) leads to potent and long-term vasoconstriction, and can result in reduced blood flow resulting in intense burning pain (St. Anthonys fire), edema, cyanosis, dry gangrene and even loss of hooves in cattle or limbs in humans. Reduced prolactin due to ergot alkaloid activity on dopamine receptors in the pituitary is also common in livestock. Reduced serum prolactin is associated with various reproductive problems in cattle, and especially in horses, including agalactia and poor conception, and late-term losses of foals and sometimes mares due to dystocia and thickened placentas.[10] Although both gangrenous and convulsive symptoms are seen in naturally occurring ergotism resulting from the ingestion of fungus infected rye, only gangrenous ergotism has been reported following the excessive ingestion of ergotamine tartrate.[18] Ergot extract has been used in pharmaceutical preparations, including ergot alkaloids in products such as Cafergot (containing caffeine and ergotamine[17] or ergoline) to treat migraine headaches, and ergometrine, used to induce uterine contractions and to control bleeding after childbirth.[19] Clinical ergotism as seen today results almost exclusively from the excessive intake of ergotamine tartrate in the treatment of migraine headache.[18]\\r\\nIn addition to ergot alkaloids, Claviceps paspali also produces tremorgens (paspalitrem) causing \\"paspalum staggers\\" in cattle.[20] The fungi of the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus also produce ergot alkaloids, notably some isolates of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus,[21] and have been isolated from plants in the family Convolvulaceae, of which morning glory is best known.The causative agents of most ergot poisonings are the ergot alkaloid class of fungal metabolites, though some ergot fungi produce distantly related indole-diterpene alkaloids that are tremorgenic.[10]\\r\\nErgot does not contain lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) but instead contains lysergic acid as well as its precursor,[22] ergotamine. Lysergic acid is a precursor for the synthesis of LSD.Their realized and hypothesized medicinal uses have encouraged intensive research since the 1950s culminating on the one hand in development of drugs both legal (e.g., bromocriptine) and illegal (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide = LSD), and on the other hand in extensive knowledge of the enzymes, genetics, and diversity of ergot alkaloid biosynthetic pathways.[10]\\r\\nThe January 4, 2007 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine includes a paper that documents a British study of more than 11,000 Parkinson's Disease patients. The study found that two ergot-derived drugs, pergolide and cabergoline, commonly used to treat Parkinson's Disease may increase the risk of leaky heart valves by up to 700%.[23]\\r\\nErgotism is the earliest recorded example of mycotoxicosis, or poisoning caused by toxic molds.[24] Early references to ergot poisoning (ergotism) date back as far as 600 BC, an Assyrian tablet referred to it as a 'noxious pustule in the ear of grain'.[25] In 350 BC, the Parsees described 'noxious grasses that cause pregnant women to drop the womb and die in childbed'.[25] In ancient Syria, ergot was called 'Daughter of Blood'.[26] In 1582 AD, Adam Lonicer, of Frankfort, describes the appearance of ergot in fields of rye grass and mentions its efficacy for women during childbirth.[26] Johannes Thallius, in 1588 AD, writes that it is called 'Mother of Rye', or rockenmutter, and is used to halt bleeding.[26] In 944 AD, a massive outbreak of ergotism caused 40,000 deaths in the regions of Aquitaine, Limousin, Perigord, and Angoumois in France.[24] In 944 AD, Radulf Glaber describes an ailment he calls 'hidden fire' or ignus ocultus, in which a burning of the limb is followed by its separation from the body, often consuming the victim in one night.[26] Human poisoning due to the consumption of rye bread made from ergot-infected grain was common in Europe in the Middle Ages. The first mention of a plague of gangrenous ergotism in Europe comes from Germany in 857 AD, following this France, Germany and Scandinavia experienced similar outbreaks.[27] England is noticeably absent from the regions affected by ergotism as their main source of food was wheat, which is resistant to ergot fungi.[26] Wendalin Thelius was one of the first to attribute ergotism poisoning to grain; in the Kingdom of Hesse in 1596 AD.[27] S Tessier, observing a huge epidemic at Sologne, France, in 1778 AD in which more than 8000 people died, recommended drainage of fields, compulsory cleaning of grain, and the substitution of potatoes for affected grain.[27] In 1722, the Russian Tzar Peter the Great was thwarted in his attack against the Ottoman Empire as his army travelling down the Terek steppe were struck by ergotism and he was forced to retreat to find edible grains for his soldiers. (Bennett 347) A diary entry from the time describes that as soon as people ate the poisoned bread they became dizzy, with such strong contractions of the nerves that those who did not die from the first day, find their hands and feet falling from them, as from frostbite.[28] The epidemic was known as Saint Anthony's fire,[14] or ignis sacer, and some historical events, such as the Great Fear in France during the Revolution have been linked to ergot poisoning.[29] St.Anthony was a 3rd century Egyptian ascetic who lived by the Red Sea and was known for long fasting in which he confronted terrible visions and temptations sent from the Devil.[27] His name was taken by an Order of Hospitalers founded in 1095 AD by a wealthy Frenchman who, whilst praying for his ill son, received a vision of St.Anthony asking that he dedicate his life to healing the sick and injured.[26] St.Anthony was a popular subject for art in the middle ages and his symbol is a large blue T sewn onto the shoulder of the monks of the order which symbolizes the crutch used by the ill and injured.[30] The Order of St.Anthony grew quickly and hospitals spread through France, Germany, and Scandinavia and gained wealth and power as grateful patrons bestowed monies and charitable goods to the hospitals.[26] By the end of the Middle Ages, there were 396 settlements and 372 hospitals owned by the Order of St.Anthony.[30] Pilgrimages to St.Anthony's hospitalers became popular as well as the donation of limbs lost to ergotism which were displayed near shrines to the Saint.[26] These hagiotherapeutic centers were the first specialized European medical welfare systems and the friars of the order were knowledgeable about treatment of ergotism and the horrifying effects of the poison.[30] The sufferers would receive ergot-free meals, wines containing vasodilating and analgesic herbs, and applications of Antonites balsalm, which was the first transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) in medical history.[25] Their medical recipes have been lost to time, though some recorded treatments still remain.[30] After 1130 AD, the monks were no longer permitted to perform operations, and so barber surgeons were employed to remove gangrenous limbs and treat open sores.[30] Three barbers founded a hospital at Memmingten in 1214 and accepted those who were afflicted with the gangrenous form of ergotism, for the remainder of their days they were fed and housed with the more bodily abled acting as orderlies and assistants. Patients with the convulsive form of ergotism, or ergotismus convulsivus were welcomed for only nine days before they were asked to leave. The convulsive form of ergotism was seen as less detrimental though the sufferers often experienced irreversible effects, they most often returned to their families and resumed their livelihoods.[30] An important aspect to the Order of St.Anthony was the exclusion of rye bread and other ergot containing edibles which halted the progression of ergotism.[26] There is no known cure however there is treatment of the symptoms of ergotism which is notable for blood constriction, nervous disorder, and/or hallucinations; if the sufferer survived the initial poisoning, his limbs would often fall off and he or she would continue to improve in health if they halted consumption of ergot.[27] The trunk of the body remained relatively untouched by the disease until it's final stages and the victims, not understanding the cause of their ailment, would continue to imbibe ergot laden food for weeks until the condition reached their digestive system.[30] It is believed that the peasantry and children were most susceptible to ergotism though the wealthy were afflicted as well, as at times entire villages relied on tainted crops for sustenance and during times of famine, ergotism reached into every house.[25] Ergot fungus is impervious to heat and water, thus it was most often baked into bread through rye flour though other grasses can be infected it was uncommon in Europe to consume grasses other than rye.[26] The physiological effects of ergot depended upon the concentration and combinations of the ingested ergot metabolites, as well as the age and nutritional status of the afflicted individual.[28] The Order of St.Anthony began to decline after physicians discovered the genesis of ergotism and recommended methods for removing the sclerotium from the rye crops. In 1776 AD, the cloisters of St.Anthony were incorporated into the Order of the Knight Hospitaller (Maltese), losing much of their medical histories in the process and losing the ergotism cures and recipes due to lack of use and lack of preservation.[30] Linnda R. Caporael posited in 1976 that the hysterical symptoms of young women that had spurred the Salem witch-trials had been the result of consuming ergot-tainted rye.[31] However, Nicholas P. Spanos and Jack Gottlieb, after a review of the historical and medical evidence, later disputed her conclusions.[32] Other authors have likewise cast doubt on ergotism as the cause of the Salem witch trials.[33]\\r\\nMidwives and doctors have used extracts from ergots to hasten childbirth or to induce abortions for centuries.[34] \\"Ergot of rye\\", wrote Francis Ramsbotham, founder of the Obstetrical Society of London, in 1841, \\"has been known to possess deleterious and poisonous qualities for more than 800 years, and it has been used on the continent by female midwives as a promoter of labour pains for nearly 150 years\\"[27] The first reference to use of ergot in childbirth seems to be from 1582 AD, when a German physician, A Lonicer, recommended use of three sclerotia of ergot to speed contractions of prolonged labour; in 1688 AD, another German physician, R J Camerarius, wrote that midwives would give it to accelerate parturition; and in France, A.A. Parmentier wrote in his Journal de Physique of 1774 AD that ergot was frequently used by midwives as \\"a childbed remedy\\".[27] F. Paulisky, a german physician labels the use of ergot as pulvis ad partum or a powder to aid birth, in 1787.[27]\\r\\nPrevious research has shown that the prophylactic use of uterotonic agents in the third stage of labour reduces both postpartum blood loss and postpartum haemorrhage.[35] In 1808 John Stearns of upper New York State learned from an immigrant German midwife of a new means to effect the mechanics of birth. This was ergot, a powerful natural drug that stimulates uterine muscles when given orally. It causes unremitting contractions. Stearns stressed its value in saving doctors time and relieving women of the agony of long labor. The 1836 Dispensatory of the United States recommended 15 to 20 grains (sclerotia) to induce uterine contractions and in 1839 the French Codex required ergot to be kept in all pharmacies.[24] Though ergot was known to cause abortions in cattle and women, it was not a recognized use for it as abortion was illegal in most countries thus evidence for its use in abortion is unknown.[24] Most often ergot was used to speed the process of parturition or delivery, and was not used for the purpose of halting postpartum bleeding, which is a concern of childbirth.[27] However, until anesthesia became available, there was no antidote or way of controlling the effects of ergot. So if the fetus did not move as expected, the drug could cause the uterus to mold itself around the child, rupturing the uterus and killing the child. David Hosack, an American physician, noted the large number of stillbirths resulting from ergot use and stated that rather than pulvis ad partum, it should be called pulvis ad mortem.[27] He began advocating for its use to halt postpartum bleeding.Eventually, doctors determined that the use of ergot in childbirth without an antidote was too dangerous. They ultimately restricted its use to expelling the placenta or stopping hemorrhage.Not only did it constrict the uterus, ergot had the ability to increase or decrease blood pressure, induce hypothermia and emesis, and influence pituitary hormone secretions.[24] In 1926, Swiss psychiatrist Hans Maier suggested to use ergotamine for the treatment of vascular headaches of the migraine type.[16]\\r\\nIn the 1930s, abortifacients drugs were marketed to women by various companies under various names such as Molex Pills and Cote Pills. Since birth control devices and abortifacients were illegal to market and sell at the time, they were offered to women who were \\"delayed\\". The recommended dosage was seven grains of ergotin a day. According to the FTC[36] these pills contained ergotin, aloes, Black Hellebore, and other substances. The efficacy and safety of these pills are unknown. The FTC deemed them unsafe and ineffective and demanded that they cease and desist selling the product.Currently, over a thousand compounds have been derived from ergot ingredients.[16]\\r\\nBritish author John Grigsby contends that the presence of ergot in the stomachs of some of the so-called 'bog-bodies' (Iron Age human remains from peat bogs N E Europe such as Tollund Man) is indicative of use of ergot in ritual drinks in a prehistoric fertility cult akin to the Eleusinian Mysteries cult of ancient Greece. In his book Beowulf and Grendel, he argues that the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf is based on a memory of the quelling of this fertility cult by followers of Odin. He writes that Beowulf, which he translates as barley-wolf, suggests a connection to ergot which in German was known as the 'tooth of the wolf'. Beowulf is alternatively theorized to be translated at 'bee-wolf', a kenning for 'bear', to reference his berserker (bear shirt) state.[37]\\r\\nKykeon, the beverage consumed by participants in the ancient Greek cult of Eleusinian Mysteries, might have been based on hallucinogens from ergot,[38] and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent hallucinogen, which was first synthesized from ergot alkaloids by the Swiss chemist, Albert Hofmann, in 1938,while he was searching for a respiratory and circulatory stimulant. He discovered its effect on the nervous system accidentally in 1943 when he ingested the substance and mentioned a hallucinogenic reaction.[16]\\r\\nMankind has known about Claviceps purpurea for a long time, and its appearance has been linked to extremely cold winters that were followed by rainy summers.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe sclerotial stage of C. purpurea conspicuous on the heads of ryes and other such grains is known as ergot. Favorable temperatures for growth are in the range of 18ÿ30?C. Temperatures above 37?C cause rapid germination of conidia.[citation needed] Sunlight has a chromogenic effect on the mycelium, with intense coloration.[citation needed] Cereal mashes and sprouted rye are suitable substrates for growth of the fungus in the laboratory.[citation needed]\\r\\nClaviceps africana infects sorghum. . In sorghum and pearl millet, ergot became a problem when growers adopted hybrid technology, which increased host susceptibility.[16] It only infects unfertilized ovaries, so self-pollination and fertilization can decrease the presence of the disease, but male-sterile lines are extremely vulnerable to infection.[citation needed] Symptoms of infection by C. africana include the secretion of honeydew (a fluid with high concentrates of sugar and conidia), which attracts insects like flies, beetles, and wasps that feed on it. This in turn contributes to the spread of the fungus to uninfected plants.\\r\\nC. africana caused ergot disease that caused a famine in 1903-1906 in Northern Cameroon, West Africa, and also occurs in eastern and southern Africa, especially Zimbabwe and South Africa. Male sterile sorghums (also referred to as A-lines) are especially susceptible to infection, as first recognized in the 1960s, and massive losses in seed yield have been noted. Infection is associated with cold night temperatures that are below 12?C occurring two to three weeks before flowering.[citation needed]\\r\\nSorghum ergot caused by Claviceps africana Frederickson, Mantle and De Milliano is widespread in all sorghum growing areas, whereas the species was formerly restricted to Africa and Asia where it was first recorded more than 90 years ago, it has been spreading rapidly and by the mid-1990s it reached Brazil, South Africa, and Australia. By 1997,the disease had spread to most South American countries and the Caribbean including Mexico, and by 1997 had reached Texas in the United States.[16]\\r\\nMorning glory: Argyreia nervosa (Hawaiian Baby Woodrose), Ipomoea spp.(Morning Glory, Tlitliltzin, Badoh Negro), Rivea corymbosa (Coaxihuitl, Ololi~qui)","input":"What type of pathogen causes ergot of rye?"},{"output":"737 local branches and Service Centers","context":"People's Bank is a state-owned commercial bank in Sri Lanka.

Many ATMs have a sign above them,  indicating the name of the bank or organisation that owns the ATM, and possibly including the networks to which it can connect. In Canada, ABMs that are not operated by a financial institution are known as \\"white-label ABMs\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA),[7] there are now close to 3.5 million ATMs installed worldwide.[8] However, the use of ATMs in Australia is gradually declining ÿ most notably in retail precincts.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn most modern ATMs, customers are identified by inserting a plastic ATM card (or some other acceptable payment card) into the ATM, with authentication being by the customer entering a personal identification number (PIN), which must match the PIN stored in the chip on the card (if the card is so equipped), or in the issuing financial institution's database.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing an ATM, customers can access their bank deposit or credit accounts in order to make a variety of financial transactions such as cash withdrawals, check balances, or credit mobile phones. ATMs can be used to withdraw cash in a foreign country. If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that in which the bank account is denominated, the money will be converted at the financial institution's exchange rate.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of out-of-hours cash distribution developed from bankers' needs in Asia (Japan), Europe (Sweden and the United Kingdom) and North America (the United States).[11][12][13] Little is known of the Japanese device other than that it was called \\"Computer Loan Machine\\" and supplied cash as a three-month loan at 5% p.a. after inserting a credit card. The device was operational in 1966.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdrian Ashfield invented the basic idea of a card combining the key and user's identity in February 1962. This was granted UK Patent 959,713 for \\"Access Controller\\" in June 1964 and assigned to W. S. Atkins & Partners who employed Ashfield. He was paid ten shillings for this, the standard sum for all patents. It was originally intended to dispense petrol but the patent covered all uses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the US patent record, Luther George Simjian has been credited with developing a \\"prior art device\\". Specifically his 132nd patent (US3079603), which was first filed on 30 June 1960 (and granted 26 February 1963). The roll-out of this machine, called Bankograph, was delayed by a couple of years, due in part to Simjian's Reflectone Electronics Inc. being acquired by Universal Match Corporation.[16] An experimental Bankograph was installed in New York City in 1961 by the City Bank of New York, but removed after six months due to the lack of customer acceptance. The Bankograph was an automated envelope deposit machine (accepting coins, cash and cheques) and did not have cash dispensing features.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is widely accepted  that the first cash machine was put into use by Barclays Bank in its Enfield Town branch in North London, United Kingdom, on 27 June 1967.[19] This machine was inaugurated by English comedy actor Reg Varney.[20] This instance of the invention is credited to the engineering team led by John Shepherd-Barron of printing firm De La Rue,[21] who was awarded an OBE in the 2005 New Year Honours.[22][23] Transactions were initiated by inserting paper cheques issued by a teller or cashier, marked with carbon-14 for machine readability and security, which in a later model were matched with a six-digit personal identification number (PIN).[21][24] Shepherd-Barron stated \\"It struck me there must be a way I could get my own money, anywhere in the world or the UK. I hit upon the idea of a chocolate bar dispenser, but replacing chocolate with cash.\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BarclaysÿDe La Rue machine (called De La Rue Automatic Cash System or DACS)[25] beat the Swedish saving banks' and a company called Metior's machine (a device called Bankomat) by a mere nine days and Westminster Bank'sÿSmith IndustriesÿChubb system (called Chubb MD2) by a month.[26] The online version of the Swedish machine is listed to have been operational on 6 May 1968, while claiming to be the first online ATM in the world (ahead of a similar claim by IBM and Lloyds Bank in 1971).[27] The collaboration of a small start-up called Speytec and Midland Bank developed a fourth machine which was marketed after 1969 in Europe and the US by the Burroughs Corporation. The patent for this device (GB1329964) was filed in September 1969 (and granted in 1973) by John David Edwards, Leonard Perkins, John Henry Donald, Peter Lee Chappell, Sean Benjamin Newcombe, and Malcom David Roe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the DACS and MD2 accepted only a single-use token or voucher which was retained by the machine, while the Speytec worked with a card with a magnetic stripe at the back. They used principles including Carbon-14 and low-coercivity magnetism in order to make fraud more difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of a PIN stored on the card was developed by a group of engineers working at Smiths Group on the Chubb MD2 in 1965 and which has been credited to James Goodfellow[28] (patent GB1197183 filed on 2 May 1966 with Anthony Davies). The essence of this system was that it enabled the verification of the customer with the debited account without human intervention. This patent is also the earliest instance of a complete \\"currency dispenser system\\" in the patent record. This patent was filed on 5 March 1968 in the US (US 3543904) and granted on 1 December 1970. It had a profound influence on the industry as a whole. Not only did future entrants into the cash dispenser market such as NCR Corporation and IBM licence Goodfellow's PIN system, but a number of later patents reference this patent as \\"Prior Art Device\\".[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nDevices designed by British (i.e. Chubb, De La Rue) and Swedish (i.e. Asea Meteor) quickly spread out. For example, given its link with Barclays,  Bank of Scotland deployed a DACS in 1968 under the  'Scotcash' brand. Customers were given personal code numbers to activate the machines, similar to the modern PIN. They were also supplied with S10 vouchers. These were fed into the machine, and the corresponding amount debited from the customer's account.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Chubb-made ATM appeared in Sydney in 1969. This was the first ATM installed in Australia. The machine only dispensed $25 at a time and the bank card itself would be mailed to the user after the bank had processed the withdrawal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsea Metior's Bankomat was the first ATM installed in Spain on January 9, 1969, in downtown Madrid by Banesto. This device dispensed 1,000 peseta bills (1 to 5 max). Each user had to introduce a security personal key using a combination of the ten numeric buttons.[30] In March of the same year an ad with the instructions to use the Bancomat was published in the same newspaper.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter looking firsthand at the experiences in Europe, in 1968 the ATM was pioneered in the U.S. by Donald Wetzel, who was a department head at a company called Docutel.[23] Docutel was a subsidiary of Recognition Equipment Inc of Dallas, Texas, which was producing optical scanning equipment and had instructed Docutel to explore automated baggage handling and automated gasoline pumps.[32] In 1969, a venture capital consortium purchased Docutel with the aim of bringing its ATM to market without delay. By 1974, Docutel had acquired 70 percent of the U.S. market; but as a result of the early 1970s worldwide recession and its reliance on a single product line, Docutel lost its independence and was forced to merge with the U.S. subsidiary of Olivetti.\\r\\n\\r\\nWetzel was recognised by the United States Patent Office as having invented the ATM in the form of U.S. Patent # 3,761,682; the application had been filed in October 1971 and the patent was granted in 1973. However, the U.S. patent record cites at least three previous applications from Docutel, all relevant to the development of the ATM and where Wetzel does not figure, namely US Patent # 3,662,343,  U.S. Patent # 3651976 and U.S. Patent # 3,68,569. These patents are all credited to Kenneth S. Goldstein, MR Karecki, TR Barnes, GR Chastian and John D. White.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 2, 1969, Chemical Bank installed the first ATM in the U.S. at its branch in Rockville Centre, New York. The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card.[33]  A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted \\"On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again.\\"[34]  Chemical's ATM, initially known as a Docuteller was designed by Donald Wetzel and his company Docutel. Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the electronic banking transition given the high cost of the early machines.  Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money.[35] In 1995, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History recognised Docutel and Wetzel as the inventors of the networked ATM.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first modern ATM was an IBM 2984 and came into use at Lloyds Bank, High Street, Brentwood, Essex, the UK in December 1972. The IBM 2984 was designed at the request of Lloyds Bank. The 2984 Cash Issuing Terminal was the first true ATM, similar in function to today's machines and named by Lloyds Bank: Cashpoint. Cashpoint is still a registered trademark of Lloyds Banking Group in the UK but is often used as a generic trademark to refer to ATMs of all UK banks. All were online and issued a variable amount which was immediately deducted from the account. A small number of 2984s were supplied to a U.S. bank. A couple of well known historical models of ATMs include the IBM 3614, IBM 3624 and 473x series, Diebold 10xx and TABS 9000 series, NCR 1780 and earlier NCR 770 series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first switching system to enable shared automated teller machines between banks went into production operation on February 3, 1979, in Denver, Colorado, in an effort by Colorado National Bank of Denver and Kranzley and Company of Cherry Hill, New Jersey.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newest ATM at Royal Bank of Scotland allows customers to withdraw cash up to S130 without a card by inputting a six-digit code requested through their smartphones.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nATMs can be placed at any location but are most often placed near or inside banks, shopping centers/malls, airports, railway stations, metro stations, grocery stores, petrol/gas stations, restaurants, and other locations. ATMs are also found on cruise ships and on some US Navy ships, where sailors can draw out their pay.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nATMs may be on- and off-premises. On-premises ATMs are typically more advanced, multi-function machines that complement a bank branch's capabilities, and are thus more expensive. Off-premises machines are deployed by financial institutions and Independent Sales Organisations (ISOs) where there is a simple need for cash, so they are generally cheaper single function devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the US, Canada and some Gulf countries, banks may have drive-thru lanes providing access to ATMs using an automobile.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent times, countries like India and some countries in Africa are installing ATMs in rural areas, which are solar powered.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost ATMs are connected to interbank networks, enabling people to withdraw and deposit money from machines not belonging to the bank where they have their accounts or in the countries where their accounts are held (enabling cash withdrawals in local currency). Some examples of interbank networks include NYCE, PULSE, PLUS, Cirrus, AFFN, Interac[41], Interswitch, STAR, LINK, MegaLink, and BancNet.\\r\\n\\r\\nATMs rely on authorization of a financial transaction by the card issuer or other authorizing institution on a communications network. This is often performed through an ISO 8583 messaging system.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany banks charge ATM usage fees. In some cases, these fees are charged solely to users who are not customers of the bank that operates the ATM; in other cases, they apply to all users.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to allow a more diverse range of devices to attach to their networks, some interbank networks have passed rules expanding the definition of an ATM to be a terminal that either has the vault within its footprint or utilises the vault or cash drawer within the merchant establishment, which allows for the use of a scrip cash dispenser.\\r\\n\\r\\nATMs typically connect directly to their host or ATM Controller on either ADSL or dial-up modem over a telephone line or directly on a leased line. Leased lines are preferable to plain old telephone service (POTS) lines because they require less time to establish a connection. Less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem on a POTS line rather than using a leased line, since a leased line may be comparatively more expensive to operate compared to a POTS line. That dilemma may be solved as high-speed Internet VPN connections become more ubiquitous. Common lower-level layer communication protocols used by ATMs to communicate back to the bank include SNA over SDLC, TC500 over Async, X.25, and TCP/IP over Ethernet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to methods employed for transaction security and secrecy, all communications traffic between the ATM and the Transaction Processor may also be encrypted using methods such as SSL.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are no hard international or government-compiled numbers totaling the complete number of ATMs in use worldwide. Estimates developed by ATMIA place the number of ATMs currently in use at 3 million units, or approximately 1 ATM per 3000 people in the world.[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo simplify the analysis of ATM usage around the world, financial institutions generally divide the world into seven regions, due to the penetration rates, usage statistics, and features deployed. Four regions (USA, Canada, Europe, and Japan) have high numbers of ATMs per million people.[45][46] Despite the large number of ATMs, there is additional demand for machines in the Asia/Pacific area as well as in Latin America.[47][48] Macau may have the highest density of ATMs at 254 ATMs per 100,000 adults.[49]  ATMs have yet to reach high numbers in the Near East and Africa.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's highest ATM is located at the Khunjerab Pass in Pakistan. Installed at an elevation of 15,397 feet by the National Bank of Pakistan, it is designed to work in temperatures of up to -40 degree Celsius.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ATM is typically made up of the following devices:\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to heavier computing demands and the falling price of personal computerÿlike architectures, ATMs have moved away from custom hardware architectures using microcontrollers or application-specific integrated circuits and have adopted the hardware architecture of a personal computer, such as USB connections for peripherals, Ethernet and IP communications, and use personal computer operating systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness owners often lease ATMs from service providers. However, based on the economies of scale, the price of equipment has dropped to the point where many business owners are simply paying for ATMs using a credit card.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew ADA voice and text-to-speech guidelines imposed in 2010, but required by March 2012[52] have forced many ATM owners to either upgrade non-compliant machines or dispose them if they are not upgradable, and purchase new compliant equipment. This has created an avenue for hackers and thieves to obtain ATM hardware at junkyards from improperly disposed decommissioned machines.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vault of an ATM is within the footprint of the device itself and is where items of value are kept. Scrip cash dispensers do not incorporate a vault.\\r\\n\\r\\nMechanisms found inside the vault may include:\\r\\n\\r\\nATM vaults are supplied by manufacturers in several grades. Factors influencing vault grade selection include cost, weight, regulatory requirements, ATM type, operator risk avoidance practices and internal volume requirements.[54] Industry standard vault configurations include Underwriters Laboratories UL-291 \\"Business Hours\\" and Level 1 Safes,[55] RAL TL-30 derivatives,[56] and CEN EN 1143-1 - CEN III and CEN IV.[57][58]\\r\\n\\r\\nATM manufacturers recommend that a vault be attached to the floor to prevent theft,[59] though there is a record of a theft conducted by tunnelling into an ATM floor.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the migration to commodity Personal Computer hardware, standard commercial \\"off-the-shelf\\" operating systems and programming environments can be used inside of ATMs. Typical platforms previously used in ATM development include RMX or OS/2.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the vast majority of ATMs worldwide use a Microsoft Windows operating system, primarily Windows XP Professional or Windows XP Embedded.[citation needed][needs update] In early 2014, 95% of ATMs were running Windows XP.[61] A small number of deployments may still be running older versions of the Windows OS, such as Windows NT, Windows CE, or Windows 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a computer industry security view that general public desktop operating systems(os) have greater risks as operating systems for cash dispensing machines than other types of operating systems like (secure) real-time operating systems (RTOS). RISKS Digest has many articles about ATM operating system vulnerabilities.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinux is also finding some reception in the ATM marketplace. An example of this is Banrisul, the largest bank in the south of Brazil, which has replaced the MS-DOS operating systems in its ATMs with Linux. Banco do Brasil is also migrating ATMs to Linux. Indian-based Vortex Engineering is manufacturing ATMs which operate only with Linux.\\r\\nCommon application layer transaction protocols, such as Diebold 91x (911 or 912) and NCR NDC or NDC+ provide emulation of older generations of hardware on newer platforms with incremental extensions made over time to address new capabilities, although companies like NCR continuously improve these protocols issuing newer versions (e.g. NCR's AANDC v3.x.y, where x.y are subversions). Most major ATM manufacturers provide software packages that implement these protocols. Newer protocols such as IFX have yet to find wide acceptance by transaction processors.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the move to a more standardised software base, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in the ability to pick and choose the application programs that drive their equipment. WOSA/XFS, now known as CEN XFS (or simply XFS), provides a common API for accessing and manipulating the various devices of an ATM. J/XFS is a Java implementation of the CEN XFS API.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the perceived benefit of XFS is similar to the Java's \\"Write once, run anywhere\\" mantra, often different ATM hardware vendors have different interpretations of the XFS standard. The result of these differences in interpretation means that ATM applications typically use a middleware to even out the differences among various platforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the onset of Windows operating systems and XFS on ATMs, the software applications have the ability to become more intelligent. This has created a new breed of ATM applications commonly referred to as programmable applications. These types of applications allows for an entirely new host of applications in which the ATM terminal can do more than only communicate with the ATM switch. It is now empowered to connected to other content servers and video banking systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable ATM software that operates on XFS platforms include Triton PRISM, Diebold Agilis EmPower, NCR APTRA Edge, Absolute Systems AbsoluteINTERACT, KAL Kalignite Software Platform, Phoenix Interactive VISTAatm, Wincor Nixdorf ProTopas, Euronet EFTS and Intertech inter-ATM.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the move of ATMs to industry-standard computing environments, concern has risen about the integrity of the ATM's software stack.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity, as it relates to ATMs, has several dimensions. ATMs also provide a practical demonstration of a number of security systems and concepts operating together and how various security concerns are addressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly ATM security focused on making the terminals invulnerable to physical attack; they were effectively safes with dispenser mechanisms. A number of attacks resulted, with thieves attempting to steal entire machines by ram-raiding.[65] Since the late 1990s, criminal groups operating in Japan improved ram-raiding by stealing and using a truck loaded with heavy construction machinery to effectively demolish or uproot an entire ATM and any housing to steal its cash.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother attack method, plofkraak, is to seal all openings of the ATM with silicone and fill the vault with a combustible gas or to place an explosive inside, attached, or near the machine. This gas or explosive is ignited and the vault is opened or distorted by the force of the resulting explosion and the criminals can break in.[66] This type of theft has occurred in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Denmark, Germany and Australia.[67][68] These types of attacks can be prevented by a number of gas explosion prevention devices also known as gas suppression system. These systems use explosive gas detection sensor to detect explosive gas and to neutralise it by releasing a special explosion suppression chemical which changes the composition of the explosive gas and renders it ineffective.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral attacks in the UK (at least one of which was successful) have involved digging a concealed tunnel under the ATM and cutting through the reinforced base to remove the money.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern ATM physical security, per other modern money-handling security, concentrates on denying the use of the money inside the machine to a thief, by using different types of Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation Systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common method is to simply rob the staff filling the machine with money. To avoid this, the schedule for filling them is kept secret, varying and random. The money is often kept in cassettes, which will dye the money if incorrectly opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe security of ATM transactions relies mostly on the integrity of the secure cryptoprocessor: the ATM often uses general commodity components that sometimes are not considered to be \\"trusted systems\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nEncryption of personal information, required by law in many jurisdictions, is used to prevent fraud. Sensitive data in ATM transactions are usually encrypted with DES, but transaction processors now usually require the use of Triple DES.[69] Remote Key Loading techniques may be used to ensure the secrecy of the initialisation of the encryption keys in the ATM. Message Authentication Code (MAC) or Partial MAC may also be used to ensure messages have not been tampered with while in transit between the ATM and the financial network.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have also been a number of incidents of fraud by Man-in-the-middle attacks, where criminals have attached fake keypads or card readers to existing machines. These have then been used to record customers' PINs and bank card information in order to gain unauthorised access to their accounts. Various ATM manufacturers have put in place countermeasures to protect the equipment they manufacture from these threats.[70][71]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternative methods to verify cardholder identities have been tested and deployed in some countries, such as finger and palm vein patterns,[72] iris, and facial recognition technologies. Cheaper mass-produced equipment has been developed and is being installed in machines globally that detect the presence of foreign objects on the front of ATMs, current tests have shown 99% detection success for all types of skimming devices.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nOpenings on the customer side of ATMs are often covered by mechanical shutters to prevent tampering with the mechanisms when they are not in use. Alarm sensors are placed inside ATMs and their servicing areas to alert their operators when doors have been opened by unauthorised personnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo protect against hackers, ATMs have a built-in firewall. Once the firewall has detected malicious attempts to break into the machine remotely, the firewall locks down the machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nRules are usually set by the government or ATM operating body that dictate what happens when integrity systems fail. Depending on the jurisdiction, a bank may or may not be liable when an attempt is made to dispense a customer's money from an ATM and the money either gets outside of the ATM's vault, or was exposed in a non-secure fashion, or they are unable to determine the state of the money after a failed transaction.[74] Customers often commented that it is difficult to recover money lost in this way, but this is often complicated by the policies regarding suspicious activities typical of the criminal element.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some countries, multiple security cameras and security guards are a common feature.[76] In the United States, The New York State Comptroller's Office has advised the New York State Department of Banking to have more thorough safety inspections of ATMs in high crime areas.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nConsultants of ATM operators assert that the issue of customer security should have more focus by the banking industry;[78] it has been suggested that efforts are now more concentrated on the preventive measure of deterrent legislation than on the problem of ongoing forced withdrawals.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least as far back as July 30, 1986, consultants of the industry have advised for the adoption of an emergency PIN system for ATMs, where the user is able to send a silent alarm in response to a threat.[80] Legislative efforts to require an emergency PIN system have appeared in Illinois,[81] Kansas[82] and Georgia,[83] but none have succeeded yet. In January 2009, Senate Bill 1355 was proposed in the Illinois Senate that revisits the issue of the reverse emergency PIN system.[84]  The bill is again supported by the police and denied by the banking lobby.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, three towns outside Cleveland, Ohio, in response to an ATM crime wave, adopted legislation requiring that an emergency telephone number switch be installed at all outdoor ATMs within their jurisdiction. In the wake of a homicide in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, the city council passed an ATM security bill as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn China and elsewhere, many efforts to promote security have been made. On-premises ATMs are often located inside the bank's lobby, which may be accessible 24 hours a day. These lobbies have extensive security camera coverage, a courtesy telephone for consulting with the bank staff, and a security guard on the premises. Bank lobbies that are not guarded 24 hours a day may also have secure doors that can only be opened from outside by swiping the bank card against a wall-mounted scanner, allowing the bank to identify which card enters the building. Most ATMs will also display on-screen safety warnings and may also be fitted with convex mirrors above the display allowing the user to see what is happening behind them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2013, the only claim available about the extent of ATM-connected homicides is that they range from 500 to 1,000 per year in the US, covering only cases where the victim had an ATM card and the card was used by the killer after the known time of death.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term jackpotting is used to describe one method criminals utilize to steal money from an ATM.  The thieves gain physical access through a small hole drilled in the machine. They disconnect the existing hard drive and connect an external drive using an industrial endoscope. They then depress an internal button that reboots the device so that it is now under the control of the external drive. They can then have the ATM dispense all of its cash.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nATMs were originally developed as cash dispensers, and have evolved to provide many other bank-related functions: \\r\\n\\r\\nIn some countries, especially those which benefit from a fully integrated cross-bank network (e.g.: Multibanco in Portugal), ATMs include many functions that are not directly related to the management of one's own bank account, such as:\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreasingly, banks are seeking to use the ATM as a sales device to deliver pre approved loans and targeted advertising using products such as ITM (the Intelligent Teller Machine) from Aptra Relate from NCR.[92]  ATMs can also act as an advertising channel for other companies.[93]*\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, several different ATM technologies have not yet reached worldwide acceptance, such as:\\r\\n\\r\\nVideoconferencing teller machines are currently referred to as Interactive Teller Machines. Benton Smith, in the Idaho Business Review writes \\"The software that allows interactive teller machines to function was created by a Salt Lake City-based company called uGenius, a producer of video banking software. NCR, a leading manufacturer of ATMs, acquired uGenius in 2013 and married its own ATM hardware with uGenius' video software.\\" [104]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore an ATM is placed in a public place, it typically has undergone extensive testing with both test money and the backend computer systems that allow it to perform transactions. Banking customers also have come to expect high reliability in their ATMs,[105] which provides incentives to ATM providers to minimise machine and network failures. Financial consequences of incorrect machine operation also provide high degrees of incentive to minimise malfunctions.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nATMs and the supporting electronic financial networks are generally very reliable, with industry benchmarks typically producing 98.25% customer availability for ATMs[107] and up to 99.999% availability for host systems that manage the networks of ATMs. If ATM networks do go out of service, customers could be left without the ability to make transactions until the beginning of their bank's next time of opening hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis said, not all errors are to the detriment of customers; there have been cases of machines giving out money without debiting the account, or giving out higher value notes as a result of incorrect denomination of banknote being loaded in the money cassettes.[108] The result of receiving too much money may be influenced by the card holder agreement in place between the customer and the bank.[109][110]\\r\\n\\r\\nErrors that can occur may be mechanical (such as card transport mechanisms; keypads; hard disk failures; envelope deposit mechanisms); software (such as operating system; device driver; application); communications; or purely down to operator error.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo aid in reliability, some ATMs print each transaction to a roll-paper journal that is stored inside the ATM, which allows its users and the related financial institutions to settle things based on the records in the journal in case there is a dispute. In some cases, transactions are posted to an electronic journal to remove the cost of supplying journal paper to the ATM and for more convenient searching of data.\\r\\n\\r\\nImproper money checking can cause the possibility of a customer receiving counterfeit banknotes from an ATM. While bank personnel are generally trained better at spotting and removing counterfeit cash,[111][112] the resulting ATM money supplies used by banks provide no guarantee for proper banknotes, as the Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany has confirmed that there are regularly incidents of false banknotes having been dispensed through ATMs.[113] Some ATMs may be stocked and wholly owned by outside companies, which can further complicate this problem.\\r\\nBill validation technology can be used by ATM providers to help ensure the authenticity of the cash before it is stocked in the machine; those with cash recycling capabilities include this capability.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn India, whenever a transaction fails with an ATM due to network or technical issue and if the amount does not get dispensed in spite of account being debited then the banks are supposed to return back the debited amount to the customer within 7 working days from the day of receipt of complaint. Banks are also liable to pay the late fees in case of delay in repayment of funds post 7 days.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with any device containing objects of value, ATMs and the systems they depend on to function are the targets of fraud. Fraud against ATMs and people's attempts to use them takes several forms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first known instance of a fake ATM was installed at a shopping mall in Manchester, Connecticut in 1993. By modifying the inner workings of a Fujitsu model 7020 ATM, a criminal gang known as the Bucklands Boys stole information from cards inserted into the machine by customers.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nWAVY-TV reported an incident in Virginia Beach in September 2006 where a hacker, who had probably obtained a factory-default administrator password for a filling station's white-label ATM, caused the unit to assume it was loaded with US$5 bills instead of $20s, enabling himselfand many subsequent customersto walk away with four times the money withdrawn from their accounts.[117] This type of scam was featured on the TV series The Real Hustle.\\r\\n\\r\\nATM behaviour can change during what is called \\"stand-in\\" time, where the bank's cash dispensing network is unable to access databases that contain account information (possibly for database maintenance). In order to give customers access to cash, customers may be allowed to withdraw cash up to a certain amount that may be less than their usual daily withdrawal limit, but may still exceed the amount of available money in their accounts, which could result in fraud if the customers intentionally withdraw more money than what they had in their accounts.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an attempt to prevent criminals from shoulder surfing the customer's personal identification number (PIN), some banks draw privacy areas on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a low-tech form of fraud, the easiest is to simply steal a customer's card along with its PIN. A later variant of this approach is to trap the card inside of the ATM's card reader with a device often referred to as a Lebanese loop. When the customer gets frustrated by not getting the card back and walks away from the machine, the criminal is able to remove the card and withdraw cash from the customer's account, using the card and its PIN.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis type of fraud has spread globally. Although somewhat replaced in terms of volume by skimming incidents, a re-emergence of card trapping has been noticed in regions such as Europe, where EMV chip and PIN cards have increased in circulation.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother simple form of fraud involves attempting to get the customer's bank to issue a new card and its PIN and stealing them from their mail.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy contrast, a newer high-tech method of operating, sometimes called card skimming or card cloning, involves the installation of a magnetic card reader over the real ATM's card slot and the use of a wireless surveillance camera or a modified digital camera or a false PIN keypad to observe the user's PIN. Card data is then cloned into a duplicate card and the criminal attempts a standard cash withdrawal. The availability of low-cost commodity wireless cameras, keypads, card readers, and card writers has made it a relatively simple form of fraud, with comparatively low risk to the fraudsters.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an attempt to stop these practices, countermeasures against card cloning have been developed by the banking industry, in particular by the use of smart cards which cannot easily be copied or spoofed by unauthenticated devices, and by attempting to make the outside of their ATMs tamper evident. Older chip-card security systems include the French Carte Bleue, Visa Cash, Mondex, Blue from American Express[122] and EMV '96 or EMV 3.11. The most actively developed form of smart card security in the industry today is known as EMV 2000 or EMV 4.x.\\r\\n\\r\\nEMV is widely used in the UK (Chip and PIN) and other parts of Europe, but when it is not available in a specific area, ATMs must fall back to using the easyÿtoÿcopy magnetic stripe to perform transactions. This fallback behaviour can be exploited.[123] However, the fallback option has been removed on the ATMs of some UK banks, meaning if the chip is not read, the transaction will be declined.\\r\\n\\r\\nCard cloning and skimming can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process. This signature, known as a \\"MagnePrint\\" or \\"BluPrint\\", can be used in conjunction with common two-factor authentication schemes used in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept and various methods of copying the contents of an ATM card's magnetic stripe onto a duplicate card to access other people's financial information was well known in the hacking communities by late 1990.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, Andrew Stone, a computer security consultant from Hampshire in the UK, was convicted of stealing more than S1?million by pointing high-definition video cameras at ATMs from a considerable distance and recording the card numbers, expiry dates, etc. from the embossed detail on the ATM cards along with video footage of the PINs being entered. After getting all the information from the videotapes, he was able to produce clone cards which not only allowed him to withdraw the full daily limit for each account, but also allowed him to sidestep withdrawal limits by using multiple copied cards. In court, it was shown that he could withdraw as much as S10,000 per hour by using this method. Stone was sentenced to five years and six months in prison.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nA talking ATM is a type of ATM that provides audible instructions so that people who cannot read a screen can independently use the machine, therefore effectively eliminating the need for assistance from an external, potentially malevolent source. All audible information is delivered privately through a standard headphone jack on the face of the machine. Alternatively, some banks such as the Nordea and Swedbank use a built-in external speaker which may be invoked by pressing the talk button on the keypad.[126] Information is delivered to the customer either through pre-recorded sound files or via text-to-speech speech synthesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nA postal interactive kiosk may share many components of an ATM (including a vault), but it only dispenses items related to postage.[127][128]\\r\\n\\r\\nA scrip cash dispenser may have many components in common with an ATM, but it lacks the ability to dispense physical cash and consequently requires no vault. Instead, the customer requests a withdrawal transaction from the machine, which prints a receipt. The customer then takes this receipt to a nearby sales clerk, who then exchanges it for cash from the till.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nA teller assist unit (TAU) is  distinct in that it is designed to be operated solely by trained personnel and not by the general public, does integrate directly into interbank networks, and usually is controlled by a computer that is not directly integrated into the overall construction of the unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Web ATM is an online interface for ATM card banking that uses a smart card reader. All the usual ATM functions are available, except for withdrawing cash. Most banks in Taiwan provide these online services.[130][131]","input":"Where is the world's first atm located?"},{"output":"began on 15 March 1877 and ended on 19 March 1877","context":"Test cricket is the longest form of the sport of cricket and is considered its highest standard.[1][2] Test matches are played between national representative teams with \\"Test status\\", as determined and conferred by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The two teams of 11 players play a four-innings match, which may last up to five days (or longer in some historical cases). It is generally considered the most complete examination of teams' playing ability and endurance.[3][4][5] The name Test stems from the long, gruelling match being a \\"test\\" of the relative strengths of the two sides.[6]\\r\\nThe first officially recognised Test match began on 15 March 1877 and ended on 19 March 1877 and was played between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), where Australia won by 45 runs.[7] A Test match to celebrate 100 years of Test cricket was held in Melbourne from 12 to 17 March 1977, in which Australia beat England by 45 runsthe same margin as that first Test.[8]\\r\\nIn October 2012, the International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches.[9] The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide, on 27 November 2015.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTest matches are the highest level of cricket, although, statistically, their data forms part of first-class cricket. Matches are played between national representative teams with \\"Test status\\", as determined by the International Cricket Council. As of June 2017[update], twelve national teams have Test status, the most recently promoted being Afghanistan and Ireland on 22 June 2017.[11] Zimbabwe's Test status was voluntarily suspended, because of poor performances between 2006 and 2011; it returned to competition in August 2011.[12]\\r\\nIn January 2014, during an ICC meeting in Dubai, the pathway for new potential Test nations was laid out with the winners of the next round of the ICC Intercontinental Cup playing a 5-day match against the bottom ranked Test nation. If the Associate team defeats the Test nation, then they could be added as the new Test country and granted full membership.[13]\\r\\nA list of matches, defined as \\"Tests\\", was first drawn up by Australian Clarence Moody in the mid-1890s. Representative matches played by simultaneous England touring sides of 1891ÿ92 (in Australia and South Africa) and 1929ÿ30 (in the West Indies and New Zealand) are deemed to have \\"Test status\\".\\r\\nIn 1970, a series of five \\"Test matches\\" was played in England between England and a Rest of the World XI. These matches, originally scheduled between England and South Africa, were amended after South Africa was suspended from international cricket because of their government's policy of apartheid. Although initially given Test status (and included as Test matches in some record books, including Wisden Cricketers' Almanack), this was later withdrawn and a principle was established that official Test matches can only be between nations (although the geographically and demographically small countries of the West Indies have since 1928 been permitted to field a coalition side). Despite this, in 2005, the ICC ruled that the six-day Super Series match that took place in October 2005, between Australia and a World XI, was an official Test match. Some cricket writers and statisticians, including Bill Frindall, ignored the ICC's ruling and excluded the 2005 match from their records. The series of \\"Test matches\\" played in Australia between Australia and a World XI in 1971/72 do not have Test status. The commercial \\"Supertests\\" organised by Kerry Packer as part of his World Series Cricket enterprise and played between \\"WSC Australia\\", \\"WSC World XI\\" and \\"WSC West Indies\\" from 1977 to 1979 have never been regarded as official Test matches.\\r\\nThere are currently twelve Test-playing men's teams, representing individual nations except for England, the West Indies and Ireland. Test status is conferred upon a country or group of countries by the International Cricket Council. Teams that do not have Test status can play in the ICC Intercontinental Cup, specifically designed to allow non-Test teams to play under conditions similar to Tests. The teams are listed below with the date of each team's Test debut:\\r\\nIn May 2016, the ICC announced that it is contemplating the idea of two tiers in Test match cricket.[14] ICC hopes that this will help them draw more crowd and generate more revenue from the matches played between top tier teams. Promotion and relegation could be introduced into Test cricket as early as 2019. This will give opportunities to more countries to play Test cricket. On 7 September 2016, the ICC withdrew the proposal for a two-tier system.[15] In October 2016, ICC started contemplating a different kind of Two-Tier system for Test match cricket. This structure will be similar to that of North American professional sports, featuring two conferences of six teams each. Each team will play against all teams in their conference over a period of two years, with a Test Championship play-off between the top nations of both conferences at the end of the defined period.[16]\\r\\nIn the ICC's annual conference held on 22 June 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland were awarded Test status to become the 11th and 12th full members of the International Cricket Council.[11] Ireland are scheduled to play their first Test against Pakistan in May 2018.[17][18]\\r\\nA standard day of Test cricket consists of 3 sessions of 2 hours each, the breaks between sessions being 40 minutes for lunch, and 20 minutes for tea. However the times of sessions and intervals may be altered in certain circumstances: if bad weather or a change of innings occurs close to a scheduled break, the break may be taken immediately; if there has been a loss of playing time, for example because of bad weather, the session times may be adjusted to make up the lost time; if the batting side is nine wickets down at the scheduled tea break, then the interval may be delayed until either 30 minutes has elapsed or the team is all out;[19] the final session may be extended by up to 30 minutes if 90 or more overs have not been bowled in that day's play (subject to any reduction for adverse weather);[20] the final session may be extended by 30 minutes (except on the 5th day) if the umpires believe the result can be decided within that time.[21]\\r\\nToday, Test matches are scheduled to be played across five consecutive days. However, in the early days of Test cricket, matches were played for three or four days. Until the 1980s, it was usual to include a 'rest day,' often a Sunday. There have also been 'Timeless Tests', which did not end after a predetermined maximum time. In 2005, Australia played a match scheduled for six days against a World XI, which the ICC sanctioned as an official Test match, though the match reached a conclusion on the fourth day. In October 2017, the ICC approved a request for a four-day Test match, between South Africa and Zimbabwe, scheduled to start on 26 December 2017.[22] The ICC will trial the four-day Test format until the 2019 Cricket World Cup.[23]\\r\\nThere have been attempts by the ICC, the sport's governing body, to introduce day-night Test matches.[24] In 2012, The International Cricket Council passed playing conditions that allowed for the staging of day-night Test matches.[9] The first day-night Test took place during New Zealand's tour to Australia in November 2015.[10]\\r\\nTest cricket is played in innings (the word denotes both the singular and the plural). In each innings, one team bats and the other bowls (or fields). Ordinarily four innings are played in a Test match, and each team bats twice and bowls twice. Before the start of play on the first day, the two team captains and the match referee toss a coin; the captain who wins the toss decides whether his team will bat or bowl first.\\r\\nIn the following scenarios, the team that bats first is referred to as Team A and their opponents as Team B.\\r\\nUsually the teams will alternate at the completion of each innings. Thus, Team A will bat (and Team B will bowl) until its innings ends, and then Team B will bat and Team A will bowl. When Team B's innings ends, Team A begin their second innings, and this is followed by Team B's second innings. The winning team is the one that scores more runs in their two innings.\\r\\nA team's innings ends in one of the following ways:[25]\\r\\nIf, at the completion of its first innings, Team B's first innings total is 200 or more fewer than Team A's, the captain of Team A may (but is not required to) order Team B to have their second innings next. This is called enforcing the follow on.[26] In this case, the usual order of the third and fourth innings is reversed: Team A will bat in the fourth innings. It is rare for a team forced to follow on to win the match. In Test cricket it has only happened three times, although over 285 follow-ons have been enforced: Australia was the losing team on each occasion, twice to England, in 1894 and in 1981, and once to India in 2001.[27]\\r\\nIf the whole of the first day's play of a Test match has been lost because of bad weather or other reasons like bad light, then Team A may enforce the follow on if Team B's first innings total is 150 or more fewer than Team A's. During the 2nd Test between England and New Zealand at Headingley in 2013, England batted first after the first day was lost because of rain.[28] New Zealand, batting second, scored 180 runs fewer than England, meaning England could have enforced the follow on, though chose not to. This is similar to four-day first-class cricket, where the follow on can be enforced if the difference is 150 runs or fewer. If the Test is 2 days or fewer then the \\"follow-on\\" value is 100 runs.\\r\\nAfter 80 overs, the captain of the bowling side may take a new ball, although this is not required.[29] The captain will usually take the new ball: being harder and smoother than an old ball, a new ball generally favours faster bowlers who can make it bounce more variably. The roughened, softer surface of an old ball can be more conducive to spin bowlers, or those using reverse swing. The captain may delay the decision to take the new ball if he wishes to continue with his spinners (because the pitch favours spin). After a new ball has been taken, should an innings last a further 80 overs, then the captain will have the option to take another new ball.\\r\\nA Test match may end in one of six results:\\r\\nTest cricket is almost always played as a series of matches between two countries, with all matches in the series taking place in the same country (the host). Often there is a perpetual trophy that is awarded to the winner, the most famous of which is the Ashes contested between England and Australia. There have been two exceptions to the bilateral nature of Test cricket: the 1912 Triangular Tournament, a three-way competition between England, Australia and South Africa (hosted by England), and the Asian Test Championship, an event held in 1998ÿ99 and 2001ÿ02.\\r\\nThe number of matches in Test series has varied from one to seven.[36]\\r\\nUp until the early 1990s,[37] Test series between international teams were organised between the two national cricket organisations with umpires provided by the home team. With the entry of more countries into Test cricket, and a wish by the ICC to maintain public interest in Tests in the face of the popularity of one-day cricket, a rotation system was introduced that sees all ten Test teams playing each other over a six-year cycle, and an official ranking system (with a trophy held by the highest-ranked team). In this system, umpires are provided by the ICC. An elite panel of eleven umpires has been established, and the panel is supplemented by an additional International Panel that includes three umpires named by each Test-playing country. The elite umpires officiate almost all Test matches (usually not a Test involving their home country); the International Panel is only employed when the cricketing calendar is filled with activity, or for one-day internationals (ODIs).\\r\\nSides designated as \\"England\\" began to play in the late 18th century, but these teams were not truly representative. Early international cricket was disrupted by the French Revolution and the American Civil War. The earliest international cricket match was between USA and Canada, on 24 and 25 September 1844.[38] This has never been officially considered a \\"Test match\\". Tours of national English sides abroad took place, particularly to the USA, Australia and New Zealand. The Australian Aborigines team became the first organised overseas cricketers to tour England in 1868.\\r\\nTwo rival English tours of Australia were proposed in the early months of 1877, with James Lillywhite campaigning for a professional tour and Fred Grace for an amateur one. Grace's tour fell through and it was Lillywhite's team that toured New Zealand and Australia in 1876ÿ77. Two matches against a combined Australian XI were later classified as the first official Test matches. The first match was won by Australia, by 45 runs, and the second by England. After reciprocal tours established a pattern of international cricket, The Ashes was established as an ongoing competition during the Australian tour of England in 1882. Surprisingly beaten, a mock obituary of English cricket was published in the Sporting Times the following day: the phrase \\"The body shall be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\\" prompted the subsequent creation of the Ashes urn. The series of 1884ÿ85 was the first to be held over five matches: Shaw, writing in 1901, considered the side to be \\"the best ever to have left England\\".\\r\\nSouth Africa became the third team to play Test cricket in 1888ÿ89, when they hosted a tour by an under-strength England side.\\r\\nThe following are the perpetual trophies in Test Cricket.","input":"When was the first test cricket match played?"},{"output":"Durham","context":"Coal mining in the United Kingdom dates back to Roman times and occurred in many different parts of the country. Britain's coalfields are associated with Northumberland and  Durham, North and South Wales, Yorkshire, the Scottish Central Belt, Lancashire, Cumbria, the East and West Midlands and Kent.  After 1970, coal mining quickly collapsed and practically disappeared in the 21st century.[1]  The consumption of coal ÿ mostly for electricity ÿ fell from 157 million tonnes in 1970 to 18 million tonnes in 2016. Of the coal mined, 77% of  supplies were imported[2] from Colombia, Russia and the United States. Of the coal mined in the UK in 2016 all was from open-cast coal mines. Employment in coal mines fell from a peak of 1,191,000 in 1920 to 695,000 in 1956, 247,000 in 1976, 44,000 in 1993, and to 2,000 in 2015.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all onshore coal resources in the UK occur in rocks of the Carboniferous age, some of which extend under the North Sea. Bituminous coal is present in most of Britains coalfields and is 86% to 88% carbon. In Northern Ireland, there are extensive deposits of lignite which is less energy-dense based on oxidation (combustion) at ordinary combustion temperatures (i.e. for the oxidation of carbon - see fossil fuels).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last deep coal mine in the UK closed on 18 December 2015. Twenty-six open cast mines still remain open [5] and Banks Mining said in 2018 they planned to start mining a new site in County Durham.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Kingdom's onshore coal resources occur in rocks of the Carboniferous age, some of which extend under the North Sea.[7] The carbon content of the bituminous coal present in most of the coalfields is 86% to 88%.[8]\\r\\nBritain's coalfields are associated with Northumberland and  Durham, North and South Wales, Yorkshire, the Scottish Central Belt, Lancashire, Cumbria, the East and West Midlands and Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\nStone and Bronze Age flint axes have been discovered embedded in coal, showing that it was mined in Britain before the Roman invasion. Early miners first extracted coal already exposed on the surface and then followed the seams underground.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is probable that the Romans used outcropping coal when working iron or burning lime for building purposes. Evidence to support these theories comes mostly from ash discovered at excavations of Roman sites.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no mention of coal mining in the Domesday Book of 1086 although lead and iron mines are recorded.[11] In the 13th century there are records of coal digging in Durham[12] and Northumberland,[13] Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Lancashire, the Forest of Dean and North[14] and South Wales. At this time coal was referred to as sea cole, a reference to coal washed ashore on the north east coast of England from either the cliffs or undersea outcrops. As the supply of coal on the surface became used up, settlers followed the seam inland by digging up the shore. Generally the seam continued underground, encouraging the settlers to dig to find coal, the precursor to modern operations.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early mines would have been drift mines or adits where coal seams outcropped or by shallow bell pits where coal was close to the surface.[15] Shafts lined with tree trunks and branches have been found in Lancashire in workings dating from early 17th century and by 1750 brick lined shafts to 150 foot depth were common.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoal production increased dramatically in the 19th century as the Industrial Revolution gathered pace, as a fuel for steam engines such as the Newcomen engine, and later, the Watt steam engine.  To produce firewood in the 1860s equivalent in energy terms to domestic consumption of coal would have required 25 million acres of land per year, nearly the entire farmland area of England (26 m. acres).[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nA key development was the invention at Coalbrookdale in the early 18th century of coke which could be used to make pig iron in the blast furnace. The development of the steam locomotive by Trevithick early in the 19th century gave added impetus, and coal consumption grew rapidly as the railway network expanded through the Victorian period. Coal was widely used for domestic heating owing to its low cost and widespread availability. The manufacture of coal also provided coal gas, which could be used for heating and lighting. Most of the workers were children and men.[17] A mining business owner, Jordan Geoff of Upton colliery, West Yorkshire was prosecuted in 1927 for manslaughter for inhumane treatment of his workforce.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nUK coal production peaked in 1913 at 287 million tonnes.[4] Until the late 1960s, coal was the main source of energy produced in the UK, peaking at 228 million tonnes in 1952. Ninety-five per cent of this came from roughly 1,334 deep-mines that were operational at the time, with the rest from around 92 surface mines.[18] After modernisation of underground mining, a deep shaft mine could produce 700 million tonnes annually.[citation needed] In 1986, Kellingley colliery achieved 404,000 tonnes in a single shift.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, around a hundred North East coal mines were closed.[19] In March 1968, the last pit in the Black Country closed and pit closures were a regular occurrence in many other areas.[20] Beginning with wildcat action in 1969, the National Union of Mineworkers became increasingly militant, and was successful in gaining increased wages in their strikes in 1972 and 1974.[21] Closures were less common in the 1970s, and new investments were made in sites such as the Selby Coalfield. In early 1984, the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher announced plans to close 20 coal pits which led to the year-long miners' strike which ended in March 1985. The strike was unsuccessful in stopping the closures and led to an end to the closed shop in British Coal, as the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers was formed by miners who objected to the NUM's handling of the strike.[22] Numerous pit closures followed, and in August 1989 coal mining ended in the Kent coalfield.[23] Since 1981 production fell sharply from 128 to 17.8 million tonnes in 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1994, Prime Minister John Major privatised British Coal after announcing closures, with the majority of operations transferred to the new company UK Coal.[24][25] Nevertheless, by this time British Coal had closed all but the most economical of coal pits.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pit closures caused coal production to slump to the lowest rate in more than a century, further declining towards the end of the 1980s and into the 1990s. This coincided with initiatives for cleaner energy generation as power stations switched to gas and biomass. A total of 100 million tons was produced in 1986, but by 1995 the amount was around 50 million tons.[27] The last deep mine in South Wales closed when the coal was exhausted in January 2008. The mine was closed by British Coal in the privatisation of the industry fourteen years earlier and re-opened after being bought by the miners who had worked at the pit.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the limitations to the National Union of Mineworkers' power, British coal-dependent industries have turned to cheaper imported coal.[29]  In 2001, production was exceeded by imports for the first time. In 2014, coal imported was three times more than the coal mined in Britain, despite large resources in the country.[30] In 2009, companies were licensed to extract 125 million tonnes of coal in operating underground mines and 42 million tonnes at opencast locations.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoal mining employed 4,000 workers at 30 locations in 2013, extracting 13 million tonnes of coal.[30] The three deep-pit mines were Hatfield and Kellingley Collieries in Yorkshire and Thoresby in Nottinghamshire.[1] There were 26 opencast sites in 2014, mainly in Scotland.[5] British coal mines achieve the most economically produced coal in Europe, with a level of productivity of 3,200 tonnes per man year.[26]  Most coal is used for electricity generation and steel-making, but its use to heat homes has decreased because of pollution concerns. The commodity is also used for fertilisers, chemicals, plastics, medicines and road surfaces. Hatfield Colliery closed in June 2015, as did Thoresby, and in December 2015, Kellingley, bringing to an end deep coal mining in the UK. On 20 December, thousands of people turned out for a march in Yorkshire to mark the occasion. The march began in Knottingley and finished with a rally and party at Kellingley Miners Welfare club.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe demand for coal is likely to fall with increasing focus on renewable energy or low-carbon sources and loss of industry due to globalisation. Oil and gas reserves are predicted to run out long before coal,[32] so gas could be produced from coal by gasification.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 21 April 2017, Britain went a full day without using coal power to generate electricity for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, according to the National Grid.[34] In April 2018, a new record was set of 55 hours without coal, which in turn was broken by a period of more than 72 hours without coal a few days later.[35]","input":"When was coal first mined in the uk?"},{"output":"shortly after the French Revolution","context":"Sociology as a scholarly discipline emerged primarily out of the Enlightenment thought, shortly after the French Revolution, as a positivist science of society. Its genesis owed to various key movements in the philosophy of science and the philosophy of knowledge. Social analysis in a broader sense, however, has origins in the common stock of philosophy and necessarily pre-dates the field. Modern academic sociology arose as a reaction to modernity, capitalism, urbanization, rationalization, secularization, colonization and imperialism. Late 19th century sociology demonstrated a particularly strong interest in the emergence of the modern nation state; its constituent institutions, its units of socialization, and its means of surveillance. An emphasis on the concept of modernity, rather than the Enlightenment, often distinguishes sociological discourse from that of classical political philosophy.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious quantitative social research techniques have become common tools for governments, businesses, and organizations, and have also found use in the other social sciences. Divorced from theoretical explanations of social dynamics, this has given social research a degree of autonomy from the discipline of sociology. Similarly, \\"social science\\" has come to be appropriated as an umbrella term to refer to various disciplines which study humans, interaction, society or culture.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sociological reasoning may be traced back at least as far as the ancient Greeks (cf. Xenophanes remark: \\"If horses would adore gods, these gods would resemble horses\\"). Proto-sociological observations are to be found in the founding texts of Western philosophy (Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, Polybius and so on), as well as in the non-European thought of figures such as Confucius.[3] The characteristic trends in the sociological thinking of the ancient Greeks can be traced back to their social environment.  Because there was rarely any extensive or highly centralized political organization within states this allowed the tribal spirit of localism and provincialism to have free play. This tribal spirit of localism and provincialism pervaded most of the Greek thinking upon social phenomena.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the survey can be traced back to the Domesday Book ordered by king William I in 1086.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 13th century, Ma Tuan-Lin, a Chinese historian, first recognized patterns of social dynamics as an underlying component of historical development in his seminal encyclopedia, Wenxian Tongkao or \\"Comprehensive Examination of Literature\\".[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is evidence of early Muslim sociology from the 14th century. Some consider Ibn Khaldun, a 14th-century Tunisian, Arab, Islamic scholar from North Africa, to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology; his Muqaddimah was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on social cohesion and social conflict.[8][9][10][11][12][13] Ibn Khaldun (1332ÿ1406), in his Muqaddimah (later translated as Prolegomena in Latin), the introduction to a seven volume analysis of universal history, was the first to advance social philosophy and social science in formulating theories of social cohesion and social conflict. He is thus considered by some to be the forerunner of sociology.[8][10][12][13][14][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning the discipline of sociology, he conceived a dynamic theory of history that involved conceptualizations of social conflict and social change. He developed the dichotomy of sedentary life versus nomadic life as well as the concept of a \\"generation\\", and the inevitable loss of power that occurs when desert warriors conquer a city. Following a contemporary Arab scholar, Sati' al-Husri, the Muqaddimah may be read as a sociological work: six books of general sociology. Topics dealt with in this work include politics, urban life, economics, and knowledge. The work is based around Ibn Khaldun's central concept of 'asabiyyah, which has been translated as \\"social cohesion\\", \\"group solidarity\\", or \\"tribalism\\". This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups; it can be intensified and enlarged by a religious ideology. Ibn Khaldun's analysis looks at how this cohesion carries groups to power but contains within itself the seeds ÿ psychological, sociological, economic, political ÿ of the group's downfall, to be replaced by a new group, dynasty or empire bound by a stronger (or at least younger and more vigorous) cohesion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term (\\"sociologie\\") was first coined by the French essayist Emmanuel Joseph Sieys (1748ÿ1836),[15] from the Latin: socius, \\"companion\\"; and the suffix -ology, \\"the study of\\", from Greek ??, l܇gos, \\"knowledge\\".[16][17] In 1838, the French-thinker Auguste Comte (1798ÿ1857) ultimately gave sociology the definition that it holds today.[16] Comte had earlier expressed his work as \\"social physics\\", but that term had been appropriated by others, such as Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet (1796ÿ1874).\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint-Simon published Physiologie sociale in 1813 and devoted much of his time to the prospect that human society could be steered toward progress if scientists would form an international assembly to influence its course. He argued that scientists could distract groups from war and strife, by focusing their attention to generally improving their societies living conditions. In turn, this would bring multiple cultures and societies together and prevent conflict. Saint-Simon took the idea that everyone had encouraged from the Enlightenment, which was the belief in science, and spun it to be more practical and hands-on for the society. Saint-Simon's main idea was that industrialism would create a new launch in history. He saw that people had been seeing progress as an approach for science, but he wanted them to see it as an approach to all aspects of life. Society was making a crucial change at the time since it was growing out of a declining feudalism. This new path could provide the basis for solving all the old problems society had previously encountered. He was more concerned with the participation of man in the workforce instead of which workforce man choose. His slogan became \\"All men must work[2]  and from this, the slogan of communism was evolved \\"Each according to his capacity.[2] \\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWriting after the original Enlightenment and influenced by the work of Saint-Simon, political philosopher of social contract, Auguste Comte hoped to unify all studies of humankind through the scientific understanding of the social realm. His own sociological scheme was typical of the 19th century humanists; he believed all human life passed through distinct historical stages and that, if one could grasp this progress, one could prescribe the remedies for social ills. Sociology was to be the \\"queen science\\" in Comte's schema; all basic physical sciences had to arrive first, leading to the most fundamentally difficult science of human society itself.[16] Comte has thus come to be viewed as the \\"Father of Sociology\\".[16] Comte delineated his broader philosophy of science in The Course in Positive Philosophy [1830ÿ1842], whereas his A General View of Positivism (1865) emphasized the particular goals of sociology.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuguste Comte was so impressed with his theory of positivism that he referred to it as \\"the great discovery of the year 1822. Comte's system is based on the principles of knowledge, as seen in 3 states. This law states any kind of knowledge always begins in theological form. Here the knowledge can be explained by a superior supernatural power such as animism, spirits, or gods. It then passes to the metaphysical form where the knowledge is explained by abstract philosophical speculation. Finally, the knowledge becomes positive after being explained scientifically through observation, experiment, and comparison. The order of the laws was created in order of increasing difficulty.[2] Comte's description of the development of society is parallel to Karl Marx's own theory historical progression from capitalism to communism. They both were influenced by various Utopian-socialist thinkers of the day and agreed that some form of communism would be the climax of societal development.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn later life, Auguste Comte developed a 'religion of humanity' to give positivist societies the unity and cohesiveness found through the traditional worship people were used to.  In this new \\"religion\\" he referred to society as the \\"Great Being.\\" Comte promoted a universal love and harmony taught through the teachings of his industrial system theory.[2] For close associate John Stuart Mill, it was possible to distinguish between a \\"good Comte\\" (the author of the Course in Positive Philosophy) and a \\"bad Comte\\" (the author of the secular-religious system).[18] The system was unsuccessful but met with the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species to influence the proliferation of various Secular Humanist organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as George Holyoake and Richard Congreve.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Comte and Marx intended to develop a new scientific ideology in the wake of European secularization. Marx, in the tradition of Hegelianism, rejected the positivist method and was in turn rejected by the self-proclaimed sociologists of his day. However, in attempting to develop a comprehensive science of society Marx nevertheless became recognized as a founder of sociology by the mid 20th century. Isaiah Berlin described Marx as the \\"true father\\" of modern sociology, \\"in so far as anyone can claim the title.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo have given clear and unified answers in familiar empirical terms to those theoretical questions which most occupied men's minds at the time, and to have deduced from them clear practical directives without creating obviously artificial links between the two, was the principal achievement of Marx's theory ... The sociological treatment of historical and moral problems, which Comte and after him, Spencer and Taine, had discussed and mapped, became a precise and concrete study only when the attack of militant Marxism made its conclusions a burning issue, and so made the search for evidence more zealous and the attention to method more intense.\\r\\nIn the 1830s, Karl Marx was part of the Young Hegelians in Berlin, which discussed and wrote about the legacy of the philosopher, Hegel (1770ÿ1831) (whose seminal tome, Science of Logic was published in 1816). Although, at first sympathetic with the groups strategy of attacking Christianity to undermine the Prussian establishment, he later formed divergent ideas and broke with the Young Hegelians, attacking their views in works such as The German Ideology.  Witnessing the struggles of the laborers during the Industrial Revolution, Marx concluded that religion (or the \\"ideal\\") is not the basis of the establishment's power, but rather ownership of capital (or the \\"material\\")- processes that employ technologies, land, money and especially human labor-power to create surplus-value[21]  lie at the heart of the establishment's power. This \\"stood Hegel on his head\\" as he theorized that, at its core, the engine of history and the structure of society was fundamentally material rather than ideal. He theorized that both the realm of cultural production and political power created ideologies that perpetuated the oppression of the working class and the concentration of wealth within the capitalist class: the owners of the means of production. Marx predicted that the capitalist class would feel compelled to reduce wages or replace laborers with technology, which would ultimately increase wealth among the capitalists. However, as the workers were also the primary consumers of the goods produced, reducing their wages would result in an inevitable collapse in capitalism as a mode of economic production.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert Spencer (1820ÿ1903), the English philosopher, was one of the most popular and influential 19th-century sociologists. The early sociology of Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte and Marx; writing before and after the Darwinian revolution in biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as socially Darwinistic terms. In fact, his early writings show a coherent theory of general evolution several years before Darwin published anything on the subject.[22] Encouraged by his friend and follower Edward L. Youmans,[23][24] Spencer published The Study of Sociology in 1874, which was the first book with the term \\"sociology\\" in the title. In the 1900 edition of the journal International Monthly,[22] Franklin H. Giddings (1855ÿ1931), the first professor of sociology at Columbia University, described it as the book that \\"first awakened in England, America, France, Italy and Russia a wide interest general interest\\"[23] in the then fledgling discipline of sociology. In the United States, Charles Horton Cooley, stated in a 1920 article that The Study of Sociology \\"probably did more to arouse interest in the subject than any other publication before or since.\\"[23] It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including mile Durkheim, defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheims Division of Labour in Society is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology Durkheim borrowed extensively.[25] Also a notable biologist, Spencer coined the term \\"survival of the fittest\\" as a basic mechanism by which more effective socio-cultural forms progressed. Whilst many intellectuals of his day were proponents of socialism as a scientifically informed manner of steering society, Spencer was a critic of socialism and an advocate for a laissez-faire style of government. His ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles, especially in the United States and England.[26] Although Spencer's work is rarely discussed in contemporary sociological theory, his work has been adapted and changed, and resurfaces in various contemporary forms.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nA contemporary of Spencer, Lester Frank Ward is often described as a father of American sociology[28] and served as the first president of the American Sociological Association in 1905 and served as such until 1907. He published Dynamic Sociology in 1883; Outlines of Sociology in 1898; Pure Sociology in 1903; and Applied Sociology in 1906. Also in 1906, at the age of 65 he was appointed to professor of sociology at Brown University.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Ward as president of the American Sociological Association was William Graham Sumner from 1908 to 1909. He also held the first professorship of sociology at Yale College, and in 1876, Sumner became the first to teach a course entitled \\"sociology\\" in the English-speaking world. His course focused predominantly on the work of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. He was ideologically opposed to the sociology of Ward as he felt that society could not be steered by scientific intervention, and famously stated the alternative to \\"survival of the fittest\\" was the \\"survival of the unfittest.\\" However, he also opposed the grand theorizing of Spencer. During the Progressive Era in the United States, social Darwinism became a contentious topic and Sumner and his course at Yale College was criticized for including Spencerian ideas. This almost led to Sumner's expulsion from teaching. His most famous sociological works are What Social Classes Owe to Each Other in 1883 and Folkways: a study of the sociological importance of usages, manners, customs, mores, and morals in 1906.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany other philosophers and academics were influential in the development of sociology, not least the Enlightenment theorists of social contract, and historians such as Adam Ferguson (1723ÿ1816). For his theory on social interaction, Ferguson has himself been described as \\"the father of modern sociology\\"[30] Other early works to appropriate the term 'sociology' included A Treatise on Sociology, Theoretical and Practical by the North American lawyer Henry Hughes and Sociology for the South, or the Failure of Free Society[31] by the American lawyer George Fitzhugh. Both books were published in 1854, in the context of the debate over slavery in the antebellum US. Harriet Martineau, a Whig social theorist and the English translator of many of Comte's works, has been cited as the first female sociologist.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious other early social historians and economists have gained recognition as classical sociologists, including Robert Michels (1876ÿ1936), Alexis de Tocqueville (1805ÿ1859), Vilfredo Pareto (1848ÿ1923) and Thorstein Veblen (1857ÿ1926). The classical sociological texts broadly differ from political philosophy in the attempt to remain scientific, systematic, structural, or dialectical, rather than purely moral, normative or subjective. The new class relations associated with the development of Capitalism are also key, further distinguishing sociological texts from the political philosophy of the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormal institutionalization of sociology as an academic discipline began when Emile Durkheim founded the first French department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895. In 1896, he established the journal L'Anne Sociologique.\\r\\n\\r\\nA course entitled \\"sociology\\" was taught for the first time in the United States in 1875 by William Graham Sumner, drawing upon the thought of Comte and Herbert Spencer rather than the work of Durkheim.[32] In 1890, the oldest continuing sociology course in the United States began at the University of Kansas, lectured by Frank Blackmar. The Department of History and Sociology at the University of Kansas was established in 1891[33][34] and the first full-fledged independent university department of sociology was established in 1892 at the University of Chicago by Albion W. Small (1854ÿ1926), who in 1895 founded the American Journal of Sociology.[35] American sociology arose on a broadly independent trajectory to European sociology. George Herbert Mead and Charles H. Cooley were influential in the development of symbolic interactionism and social psychology at the University of Chicago, while Lester Ward emphasized the central importance of the scientific method with the publication of Dynamic Sociology in 1883.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Chicago developed the major sociologists at the time. It brought them together, and even gave them a hub and a network to link all the leading sociologists. In 1925, a third of all sociology graduate students attended the University of Chicago. Chicago was very good at not isolating their students from other schools. They encouraged them to blend with other sociologists, and to not spend more time in the class room than studying the society around them.  This would teach them real life application of the classroom teachings. The first teachings at the University of Chicago were focused on the social problems that the world had been dealt. At this time, academia was not concerned with theory; especially not to the point that academia is today. Many people were still hesitant of sociology at this time, especially with the recent controversial theories of Weber and Marx. The University of Chicago decided to go into an entirely different direction and their sociology department directed their attention to the individual and promoted equal rights. Their concentration was small groups and discoveries of the individuals relationship to society. The program combined with other departments to offer students well-rounded studies requiring courses in hegemony, economics, psychology, multiple social sciences and political science. Albion Small was the head of the sociology program at the University of Chicago. He played a key role in bringing German sociological advancements directly into American academic sociology. Small also created the American Journal of Sociology.  Robert Park and Ernest Burgess refined the programs methods, guidelines, and checkpoints. This made the findings more standardized, concise and easier to comprehend. The pair even wrote the sociology programs textbook for a reference and get all students on the same page more effectively. Many remarkable sociologists such as George Hebert Mead, W.E. Du Bois, Robert Park, Charles S. Johnson, William Ogburn, Hebert Blumer and many others have significant ties to the University of Chicago.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1920 a department was set up in Poland by Florian Znaniecki (1882ÿ1958). William I. Thomas was an early graduate from the Sociology Department of the University of Chicago. He built upon his education and his work changed sociology in many ways. In 1918, William I. Thomas and Florian Znaniecki gave the world the publication of \\"The Polish Peasant\\" in Europe and America. This publication combined sociological theory with in depth experiential research and thus launching methodical sociological research as a whole. This changed sociologists methods and enabled them to see new patterns and connect new theories. This publication also gave sociologists a new way to found their research and prove it on a new level. All their research would be more solid, and harder for society to not pay attention to it. In 1920, Znaniecki developed a sociology department in Poland to expand research and teachings there.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the lack of sociological theory being taught at the University of Chicago paired with the new foundations of statistical methods, the students ability to make any real predictions was nonexistent. This was a major factor in the downfall of the Chicago school.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first sociology department in the United Kingdom was founded at the London School of Economics in 1904. In 1919 a sociology department was established in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich by Max Weber, who had established a new antipositivist sociology.  The \\"Institute for Social Research\\" at the University of Frankfurt (later to become the \\"Frankfurt School\\" of critical theory) was founded in 1923.[29] Critical theory would take on something of a life of its own after WW2, influencing literary theory and the \\"Birmingham School\\" of cultural studies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Frankfurts advances along with the close proximity to the research institute for sociology made Germany a powerful force in leading sociology at that time. In 1918, Frankfurt received the funding to create sociologys first department chair. The Germanys groundbreaking work influenced its government to add the position of Minister of Culture to advance the country as a whole. The remarkable collection of men who were contributing to the sociology department at Frankfurt were soon getting worldwide attention and began being referred to as the Frankfurt school. Here they studied new perspectives of Marx theories, and went into depth of the works of Weber and Freud. Most of this men would soon be forced out of Germany by the Nazis and arrive in America, influencing social research there. This forced relocation of sociologists enabled sociology in America to bring up to the standards of European studies of sociology by planting some of Europes greatest sociologists in America.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nFelix Weil was one of the students who received their doctorate on the concept of socialization from the University of Frankfurt.  He, along with Max Horkheimer and Kurt Albert Gerlach, developed the Institute of Social Research and it was established in 1923. Kurt Albert Gerlach would serve as the institutes first director. Their goal in creating the institute was to produce a place that people could discover and be informed of social life as a whole. Weil, Horkheimer, and Gerlach wanted to focus on interactions between economics, politics, legal matters, as well as scholarly interactions in the community and society. The main research that got the institute known was its revival of scientific Marxism. Many benefactors contributed money, supplies, and buildings to keep this area of research going. When Gerlach, became ill and had to step down as director, Max Horkheimer took his place. He encouraged the students of the institute to question everything they studied. If the students studied a theory, he not only wanted them to discover its truth themselves, but also to discover how, and why it is true and the theories relation to society. The National Socialist regime exiled many of the members of the Institute of Social Research. The regime also forced many students and staff from the entire Frankfurt University, and most fled to America. Many people forced from the institute also left the war path, but unlike the university, the institute lost too many people and was forced to close. In 1950, the institute was reopened as a private establishment. From this point on the Institute of Social Research would have a close connection to sociology studies in the United States.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational cooperation in sociology began in 1893 when Ren Worms (1869ÿ1926) founded the small Institut International de Sociologie, eclipsed by much larger International Sociological Association from 1949. In 1905 the American Sociological Association, the world's largest association of professional sociologists, was founded, and Lester F. Ward was selected to serve as the first President of the new society.\\r\\n\\r\\nDurkheim, Marx, and Weber are typically cited as the three principal architects of modern social science. The sociological \\"canon of classics\\" with Durkheim and Weber at the top owes in part to Talcott Parsons, who is largely credited with introducing both to American audiences.[38] Parsons' Structure of Social Action (1937) consolidated the American sociological tradition and set the agenda for American sociology at the point of its fastest disciplinary growth. In Parsons' canon, however, Vilfredo Pareto holds greater significance than either Marx or Simmel. His canon was guided by a desire to \\"unify the divergent theoretical traditions in sociology behind a single theoretical scheme, one that could in fact be justified by purely scientific developments in the discipline during the previous half century.\\"[39] While the secondary role Marx plays in early American sociology may be attributed to Parsons,[39] as well as to broader political trends,[40] the dominance of Marxism in European sociological thought had long since secured the rank of Marx alongside Durkheim and Weber as one of the three \\"classical\\" sociologists.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe methodological approach toward sociology by early theorists was to treat the discipline in broadly the same manner as natural science. An emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method was sought to provide an incontestable foundation for any sociological claims or findings, and to distinguish sociology from less empirical fields such as philosophy.\\r\\nThis perspective, termed positivism, was first developed by theorist Auguste Comte. Positivism was founded on the theory that the only true, factual knowledge is scientific knowledge. Comte had very vigorous guidelines for a theory to be considered positivism. He thought that this authentic knowledge can only be derived from positive confirmation of theories through strict continuously tested methods, that are not only scientifically but also quantitatively based.[2] mile Durkheim was a major proponent of theoretically grounded empirical research,[42] seeking correlations to reveal structural laws, or \\"social facts\\".  Durkheim proved that concepts that had been attributed to the individual were actually socially determined. These occurrences are things such as suicide, crime, moral outrage, a persons personality, time, space, and God. He brought to light that society had influence on all aspects of a person, far more than had been previously believed.[2] For him, sociology could be described as the \\"science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning\\".[43] Durkheim endeavoured to apply sociological findings in the pursuit of political reform and social solidarity.  Today, scholarly accounts of Durkheim's positivism may be vulnerable to exaggeration and oversimplification: Comte was the only major sociological thinker to postulate that the social realm may be subject to scientific analysis in the same way as noble science, whereas Durkheim acknowledged in greater detail the fundamental epistemological limitations.[44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nReactions against positivism began when German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770ÿ1831) voiced opposition to both empiricism, which he rejected as uncritical, and determinism, which he viewed as overly mechanistic.[46] Karl Marx's methodology borrowed from Hegel dialecticism but also a rejection of positivism in favour of critical analysis, seeking to supplement the empirical acquisition of \\"facts\\" with the elimination of illusions.[47] He maintained that appearances need to be critiqued rather than simply documented. Marx nonetheless endeavoured to produce a science of society grounded in the economic determinism of historical materialism.[47] Other philosophers, including Wilhelm Dilthey (1833ÿ1911) and Heinrich Rickert (1863ÿ1936) argued that the natural world differs from the social world because of those unique aspects of human society (meanings, signs, and so on) which inform human cultures.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological antipositivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural norms, values, symbols, and social processes viewed from a subjective perspective. Max Weber argued that sociology may be loosely described as a 'science' as it is able to identify causal relationshipsespecially among ideal types, or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.[48] As a nonpositivist however, one seeks relationships that are not as \\"ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable\\"[49] as those pursued by natural scientists. Ferdinand T?nnies presented Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft (sometimes translated as community and society) as the two normal types of human association, a distinction that was developed further by Max Weber. T?nnies drew a sharp line between the realm of conceptuality and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way ('pure' sociology), whereas the second empirically and in an inductive way ('applied' sociology). Both Weber and Georg Simmel pioneered the Verstehen (or 'interpretative') approach toward social science; a systematic process in which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point-of-view. Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the phenomenological and existential writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality.[50] His sociology engaged in a neo-Kantian critique of the limits of perception, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?'[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, sociology expanded in the U.S., including developments in both macrosociology, concerned with the evolution of societies, and microsociology, concerned with everyday human social interactions. Based on the pragmatic social psychology of George Herbert Mead (1863ÿ1931), Herbert Blumer (1900ÿ1987) and, later, the Chicago school, sociologists developed symbolic interactionism.[52] In the 1920s, Gy?rgy Lukcs released History and Class Consciousness (1923), while a number of works by Durkheim and Weber were published posthumously. In the 1930s, Talcott Parsons (1902ÿ1979) developed action theory, integrating the study of social order with the structural and voluntaristic aspects of macro and micro factors, while placing the discussion within a higher explanatory context of system theory and cybernetics. In Austria and later the U.S., Alfred Schtz (1899ÿ1959) developed social phenomenology, which would later inform social constructionism. During the same period members of the Frankfurt school, such as Theodor W. Adorno (1903ÿ1969) and Max Horkheimer (1895ÿ1973), developed critical theory, integrating the historical materialistic elements of Marxism with the insights of Weber, Freud and Gramsciin theory, if not always in nameoften characterizing capitalist modernity as a move away from the central tenets of the Enlightenment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Interwar period, sociology was undermined by totalitarian governments for reasons of ostensible political control. After the Russian Revolution, sociology was gradually \\"politicized, Bolshevisized and eventually, Stalinized\\" until it virtually ceased to exist in the Soviet Union.[53] In China, the discipline was banned with semiotics, comparative linguistics and cybernetics as \\"Bourgeois pseudoscience\\" in 1952, not to return until 1979.[54] During the same period, however, sociology was also undermined by conservative universities in the West. This was due, in part, to perceptions of the subject as possessing an inherent tendency, through its own aims and remit, toward liberal or left wing thought. Given that the subject was founded by structural functionalists; concerned with organic cohesion and social solidarity, this view was somewhat groundless (though it was Parsons who had introduced Durkheim to American audiences, and his interpretation has been criticized for a latent conservatism).[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-20th century there was a generalbut not universaltrend for U.S.-American sociology to be more scientific in nature, due to the prominence at that time of action theory and other system-theoretical approaches. Robert K. Merton released his Social Theory and Social Structure (1949). By the turn of the 1960s, sociological research was increasingly employed as a tool by governments and businesses worldwide. Sociologists developed new types of quantitative and qualitative research methods. Paul Lazarsfeld founded Columbia University's Bureau of Applied Social Research, where he exerted a tremendous influence over the techniques and the organization of social research. His many contributions to sociological method have earned him the title of the \\"founder of modern empirical sociology\\".[55]  Lazarsfeld made great strides in statistical survey analysis, panel methods, latent structure analysis, and contextual analysis.[55]  He is also considered a co-founder of mathematical sociology. Many of his ideas have been so influential as to now be considered self-evident.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1959, Erving Goffman published The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life and introduced the theory of dramaturgical analysis which asserts that all individuals aim to create a specific impression of themselves in the minds of other people. C. Wright Mills presented The Sociological Imagination, encouraging humanistic discourse and a rejection of abstracted empiricism and grand theory. Parallel with the rise of various social movements in the 1960s, particularly in Britain, the cultural turn saw a rise in conflict theories emphasizing social struggle, such as neo-Marxism and second-wave feminism.[56] Ralf Dahrendorf and Ralph Miliband presented pioneering theory on class conflict and industrialized nation states. The sociology of religion saw a renaissance in the decade with new debates on secularisation thesis, globalization, and the very definition of religious practise. Theorists such as Lenski and Yinger formulated 'functional' definitions of religion; enquiring as to what a religion does rather than what it is in familiar terms. Thus, various new social institutions and movements could be examined for their religious role. Marxist theorists continued to scrutinize consumerism and capitalist ideology in analogous terms. Antonio Gramsci's Selections from the Prison Notebooks [1929ÿ1935] was finally published in English during the early 1970s.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s so-called post-structuralist and postmodernist theory, drawing upon structuralism and phenomenology as much as classical social science, made a considerable impact on frames of sociological enquiry.[citation needed] Often understood simply as a cultural style 'after-Modernism' marked by intertextuality, pastiche and irony, sociological analyses of postmodernity have presented a distinct era relating to (1) the dissolution of metanarratives (particularly in the work of Lyotard), and (2) commodity fetishism and the 'mirroring' of identity with consumption in late capitalist society (Debord; Baudrillard; Jameson).[58] Postmodernism has also been associated with the rejection of enlightenment conceptions of the human subject by thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Claude Lvi-Strauss and, to a lesser extent, in Louis Althusser's attempt to reconcile Marxism with anti-humanism. Most theorists associated with the movement actively refused the label, preferring to accept postmodernity as a historical phenomenon rather than a method of analysis, if at all. Nevertheless, self-consciously postmodern pieces continue to emerge within the social and political sciences in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, theorists outside France tended to focus on globalization, communication, and reflexivity in terms of a 'second' phase of modernity, rather than a distinct new era per se. Jrgen Habermas established communicative action as a reaction to postmodern challenges to the discourse of modernity, informed both by critical theory and American pragmatism. Fellow German sociologist, Ulrich Beck, presented The Risk Society (1992) as an account of the manner in which the modern nation state has become organized. In Britain, Anthony Giddens set out to reconcile recurrent theoretical dichotomies through structuration theory. During the 1990s, Giddens developed work on the challenges of \\"high modernity\\", as well as a new 'third way' politics that would greatly influence New Labour in U.K. and the Clinton administration in the U.S. Leading Polish sociologist, Zygmunt Bauman, wrote extensively on the concepts of modernity and postmodernity, particularly with regard to the Holocaust and consumerism as historical phenomena.[59] While Pierre Bourdieu gained significant critical acclaim for his continued work on cultural capital,[60] certain French sociologists, particularly Jean Baudrillard and Michel Maffesoli, were criticised for perceived obfuscation and relativism.[61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunctionalist systems theorists such as Niklas Luhmann remained dominant forces in sociology up to the end of the century. In 1994, Robert K. Merton won the National Medal of Science for his contributions to the sociology of science.[63] The positivist tradition is popular to this day, particularly in the United States.[64] The discipline's two most widely cited American journals, the American Journal of Sociology and the American Sociological Review, primarily publish research in the positivist tradition, with ASR exhibiting greater diversity (the British Journal of Sociology, on the other hand, publishes primarily non-positivist articles).[64]  The twentieth century saw improvements to the quantitative methodologies employed in sociology.  The development of longitudinal studies that follow the same population over the course of years or decades enabled researchers to study long-term phenomena and increased the researchers' ability to infer causality. The increase in the size of data sets produced by the new survey methods was followed by the invention of new statistical techniques for analyzing this data. Analysis of this sort is usually performed with statistical software packages such as SAS, Stata, or SPSS.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial network analysis is an example of a new paradigm in the positivist tradition. The influence of social network analysis is pervasive in many sociological sub fields such as economic sociology (see the work of J. Clyde Mitchell, Harrison White, or Mark Granovetter, for example), organizational behavior, historical sociology, political sociology, or the sociology of education. There is also a minor revival of a more independent, empirical sociology in the spirit of C. Wright Mills, and his studies of the Power Elite in the United States of America, according to Stanley Aronowitz.[65]","input":"When did sociologists (as opposed to social thinkers) first appear?"},{"output":"twin-DB 603-powered Dornier Do 335 \\"Pfeil\\"","context":"A number of aircraft have been claimed to be the fastest propeller-driven aircraft. This article presents the current record holders for several sub-classes of propeller-driven aircraft that hold recognized, documented speed records in level flight. Fdration Aronautique Internationale (FAI) records are the basis for this article.[1] Other contenders and their claims are discussed, but only those made under controlled conditions and measured by outside observers. Pilots during World War II sometimes claimed to have reached supersonic speeds in propeller-driven fighters during emergency dives, but these speeds are not included as accepted records. Neither are speeds recorded in a dive during high-speed tests with the Supermarine Spitfire, including Squadron Leader J.R. Tobin's 606mph (Mach 0.89) in a 45 dive in a Mark XI Spitfire (date unknown) and Squadron Leader Anthony F. Martindale's breaking 620mph (Mach 0.92) in the same aircraft in April 1944. [2] Flight Lieutenant Edward Powles' 690 mph (Mach 0.96) in Spitfire PR.XIX PS852 during an emergency dive while carrying out spying flights over China on 5 February, 1952 is also discounted. This would otherwise be the highest speed ever recorded for a piston-engined aircraft. [3]\\r\\nAircraft that use propellers as their prime propulsion device constitute a historically important subset of aircraft, despite inherent limitations to their speed. Aircraft powered by piston engines get virtually all of their thrust from the propeller driven by the engine. A few piston engined aircraft derive some thrust from the engine's exhaust gases, and there are certain hybrid types like the Motorjet that use a piston engine to drive the compressor of a jet engine, which supplies the primary thrust (although some types also have a propeller powered by the piston engine for low speed efficiency). All aircraft prior to World War II (except for a tiny number of early jet aircraft and rocket aircraft) used piston engines to drive propellers, so all Flight airspeed records prior to 1944 were necessarily set by propeller-driven aircraft. Rapid advances in first liquid-fueled rocket engine-powered aircraft - with a 623 mph record set in October 1941 by a German example  and axial-flow jet engine technology during World War II meant that no propeller-driven aircraft would ever again hold an absolute air speed record. Shock wave formation in propeller-driven aircraft at speeds near sonic conditions, impose limits not encountered in jet aircraft.\\r\\nJet engines, particularly turbojets, are a type of gas turbine configured such that most of the work available results from the thrust of the hot exhaust gases. High bypass turbofans that are used in all modern commercial jetliners, and most modern military aircraft, get most of their thrust from the internal fan, which is powered by a gas turbine; turboprop engines are similar, but use an external propeller rather than an internal fan. The hot exhaust gas from a turboprop engine can give a small amount of thrust, but the propeller is the main source of thrust.\\r\\nThe Tupolev Tu-114, a large aircraft with four turboprop engines, has a maximum speed of 870?km/h (540?mph, Mach 0.73).[4] The 11,000?kW (15,000?hp) Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprop engines designed for the Tupolev Tu-95 (and used to power the derivative Tu-114) are the most powerful turboprops ever built and drive large contra-rotating propellers. This engine-propeller combination gives the Tu-114 the official distinction of being the fastest propeller-driven aircraft in the world, a record it has held since 1960.[1][5]\\r\\nProbably the fastest aircraft ever fitted with an operating propeller was the experimental McDonnell XF-88B, which was made by installing an Allison T38 turboshaft engine in the nose of a pure jet-powered XF-88 Voodoo. This unusual aircraft was intended to explore the use of high-speed propellers and achieved supersonic speeds.[6] This aircraft is not considered to be propeller-driven since most of the thrust was provided by two jet engines.\\r\\nAn oft-cited contender for the fastest propeller-driven aircraft is the XF-84H Thunderscreech. This aircraft is named in Guinness World Records, 1997, as the fastest in this category with a speed of 1,002?km/h (623?mph, Mach 0.83).[7] While it may have been designed as the fastest propeller-driven aircraft, this goal was not realized due to its inherent instability.[8] This record speed is also inconsistent with data from the National Museum of the United States Air Force, which gives a top speed of 837?km/h (520?mph, Mach 0.70),[9] slower than the Tu-114.\\r\\nThe more \\"traditional\\" class of propeller-driven aircraft are those powered by piston engines, which include nearly all aircraft from the Wright brothers up through World War II. Today piston engines are used almost exclusively on light, general aviation aircraft. The official speed record for a piston plane is held by a modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, the Rare Bear, with a speed of 850.24?km/h (528.31?mph) on 21 August 1989 at Las Vegas, New Mexico, United States of America.[10][11]\\r\\nThe FAI record for the fastest piston-powered aircraft over a long-distance circuit is the 2000-km record of 720.13?km/h (447.47?mph) set on 22 May 1948 by Jacqueline Cochran in a P-51C. (She also holds the 100-km record of 755.67?km/hr, set in December 1947.) Higher speed records exist; some are unofficial and some were officially-timed one-way trips aided by tailwinds. Examples of the latter: a B-29 averaged 725?km/hr from Burbank to Floyd Bennett Field (3957?km in 5.455 hours) on 11 December 1945, and Joe DeBona averaged 904?km/hr from Los Angeles LAX to New York Idlewild (3981?km in 4.405 hours) in a P-51 on 30 March 1954.\\r\\nThe 1903 Wright Flyer did 48?km/h (30?mph) during its first flight; the Bleriot XI reached 75?km/h (47?mph) in 1909. Fabric-covered biplanes of the World War I era and shortly after could do up to 320?km/h (200?mph). In 1925 U.S. Army Lt. Cyrus K. Bettis flying a Curtiss R3C won the Pulitzer Trophy Race with a speed of 400.6?km/h (248.9?mph).[12]\\r\\nSpeeds of all-metal monoplanes of the 1930s jumped into the 700?km/h (430?mph) range with the Macchi M.C.72 reaching a top speed of 709?km/h (441?mph), still the record for piston-powered seaplanes.[13] The Messerschmitt Me 209 V1 set a world speed record of almost 756?km/h (470?mph) on 26 April 1939,[14] and the Republic XP-47J (a variant of the P-47 Thunderbolt) is claimed to have reached 813?km/h (505?mph) in testing[citation needed]. A prototype of the successor to the Supermarine Spitfire, the Supermarine Spiteful F.16 (RB518), reached 494?mph (795?km/h). The fastest German propeller driven aircraft to see combat in WWII was the twin-DB 603-powered Dornier Do 335 \\"Pfeil\\" which had a top speed of 763?km/h (474?mph).[15]\\r\\nDuring the 1950s two unorthodox United States Navy fighter prototypes married turboprop engines with a \\"tailsitting design\\", the Convair XFY \\"Pogo\\" and the Lockheed XFV. Maximum design speeds of 980?km/h (610?mph) at 4,600?m (15,100?ft) and 930?km/h (580?mph) respectively have been quoted. The Lockheed XFV was fitted with a less powerful engine than it was designed for and had makeshift non-retractable landing gear for horizontal takeoff and landing;[16] the Convair's landing gear supported it in a vertical position. It was usually flown with the cockpit open, since the ejection seat was thought unreliable.[17] These aircraft had \\"compromised in-flight speed\\" because of the conflicting demands of vertical and horizontal flight.[18]","input":"What was the fastest propeller plane in ww2?"},{"output":"72ÿ41","context":"The highest score in a National Football League (NFL) game occurred on November 27, 1966, when the Washington Redskins and New York Giants combined for 113 points in a 72ÿ41 victory for the Redskins.

Females, at 45 to 75?kg (99 to 165?lb), are typically a bit smaller and lighter in weight than males, at 60 to 150?kg (130 to 330?lb).[4][5] A warthog is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards. The lower pair, which is far shorter than the upper pair, becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper pair every time the mouth is opened and closed. The upper canine teeth can grow to 25.5?cm (10.0?in) long and have a wide elliptical cross section, being about 4.5?cm (1.8?in) deep and 2.5?cm (0.98?in) wide. A tusk will curve 90 or more from the root, and will not lie flat on a table, as it curves somewhat backwards as it grows. The tusks are used for digging, for combat with other hogs, and in defense against predators ÿ the lower set can inflict severe wounds.\\r\\nCommon warthog ivory is taken from the constantly growing canine teeth. The tusks, particularly the upper set, work in much the same way as elephant tusks with all designs scaled down. Tusks are carved predominantly for the tourist trade in east and southern Africa.\\r\\nThe head of the common warthog is large, with a mane down the spine to the middle of the back.[4] Sparse hair covers the body. Its color is usually black or brown. Tails are long and end with a tuft of hair. Common warthogs do not have subcutaneous fat and the coat is sparse, making them susceptible to extreme environmental temperatures.[4]\\r\\nThe common warthog is the only pig species that has adapted to grazing and savanna habitats.[6] Its diet is omnivorous, composed of grasses, roots, berries and other fruits, bark, fungi, insects, eggs and carrion.[7] The diet is seasonably variable, depending on availability of different food items. During the wet seasons, warthogs graze[6] on short perennial grasses.[8] During the dry seasons, they subsist on bulbs, rhizomes, and nutritious roots.[6][8] Warthogs are powerful diggers, using both their snouts and feet. Whilst feeding, they often bend their front feet backwards and move around on the wrists.[9] Calloused pads that protect the wrists during such movement form quite early in the development of the fetus. Although they can dig their own burrows, they commonly occupy abandoned burrows of aardvarks[8] and other animals. The common warthog commonly reverses into burrows, with its head facing the opening and ready to burst out if necessary. Common warthogs will wallow in mud to cope with high temperatures and huddle together to cope with low temperatures.[10]\\r\\nAlthough capable of fighting (males aggressively fight each other during mating season), the common warthog's primary defense is to flee by means of fast sprinting. The common warthog's main predators are humans, lions, leopards, cheetahs, crocodiles, wild dogs and hyenas. Birds of prey such as Verreaux's eagle owls and martial eagles sometimes prey on piglets.[11][12] However, if a female common warthog has any piglets, she will defend them very aggressively. On occasion, common warthogs have been observed charging and even wounding large predators. Common warthogs have also been observed allowing banded mongooses and vervet monkeys to groom them to remove ticks.[13][14]\\r\\nCommon warthogs are not territorial, but instead occupy a home range.[15] Common warthogs live in groups called sounders. Females live in sounders with their young and with other females.[7] Females tend to stay in their natal groups, while males leave, but stay within the home range.[7] Subadult males associate in bachelor groups, but live alone when they become adults.[6] Adult males only join sounders with estrous females. Warthogs have two facial glands: the tusk gland and the sebaceous gland. Common warthogs of both sexes begin to mark around six to seven months old.[16] Males tend to mark more than females.[16] They mark sleeping and feeding areas and waterholes.[16] Common warthogs use tusk marking for courtship, for antagonistic behaviors, and to establish status.[16]\\r\\nsuckling\\r\\nEtosha National park, Namibia\\r\\nFemale with young\\r\\nEtosha National park, Namibia\\r\\nYoung males fighting\\r\\nTswalu Kalahari Reserve, South Africa\\r\\nYoung male kneels to protect throat\\r\\nTswalu Kalahari Reserve, South Africa\\r\\nP. a. africanus juveniles\\r\\nSenegal\\r\\n Common warthogs are seasonal breeders.[6] Rutting begins in the late rainy or early dry season and birthing begins near the start of the following rainy season.[6] The mating system is described as \\"overlap promiscuity\\"; the males have ranges overlapping several female ranges, and the daily behavior of the female is unpredictable. Boars employ two mating strategies during the rut. With the \\"staying tactic\\", a boar will stay and defend certain females or a resource valuable to them.[17] In the \\"roaming tactic\\", boars seek out estrous sows and compete for them.[17] Boars will wait for sows to emerge outside their burrows.[6] A dominant boar will displace any other boar that also tries to court his female. When a sow leaves her den, the boar will try to demonstrate his dominance and then follow her before copulation.[6] For the \\"staying tactic\\", monogamy, female-defense polygyny, or resource-defense polygyny is promoted, while the \\"roaming tactic\\" promotes scramble-competition polygyny.[17]\\r\\nThe typical gestation period is five to six months. When they are about to give birth, sows temporarily leave their families to farrow in a separate hole.[6] The litter is 2ÿ8 piglets, with 2ÿ4 typical. The sow will stay in the hole for several weeks, nursing her piglets.[6] Common warthog sows have been observed to nurse foster piglets if they lose their own litter.[18] This behavior, known as allosucking, makes them cooperative breeders. Allosucking does not seem to be a case of mistaken identity or milk theft,[18] and may be a sign of kin altruism. Piglets begin grazing at about two to three weeks and are weaned by six months.[6] Warthog young quickly attain mobility and stay close to their mothers for defense.[19]\\r\\nAs of 1999, the common warthog population in southern Africa is estimated to be about 250,000.[20] Typical densities range between one and 10 per km2 in protected areas, but local densities of 77 per km2 were found on short grass in Nakuru National Park.[21] The species is susceptible to drought and hunting (especially with dogs), which may result in localized extinctions.[1] The common warthog is present in numerous protected areas across its extensive range.[1]","input":"Is a warthog a herbivore carnivore or omnivore?"},{"output":"Eagle Scout","context":"The advancement program for Boy Scouts of the Boy Scouts of America is symbolized by the earning of seven ranks. The advancement program is often considered to be divided into two phases. The first phase from joining to First Class is designed to teach the boy Scoutcraft skills, how to participate in a group and to learn self-reliance. The Scout badge is awarded when the Scout demonstrates a rudimentary knowledge of the Scouting ideals and program.[1] Tenderfoot,[2] Second Class[3] and First Class[4] have progressively harder requirements in the areas of Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth and Scout Spirit.\\r\\nThe second phase of Star,[5] Life[6] and Eagle is designed to develop leadership skills and allow the Scout to explore potential vocations and avocations through the merit badge program. The Star and Life ranks require that the boy serve in a position of responsibility and perform community service. Except for Scout rank (and Eagle Palms as of August 1, 2017), all ranks require that the candidate participate in a Scoutmaster conference and pass a Board of Review.[5][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMerit badges and rank may be earned by any registered Boy Scout or Varsity Scout until their eighteenth birthday. Venturers and Sea Scouts who earned First Class as a Boy Scout or Varsity Scout may continue to work towards Eagle Scout in their crew or ship until age eighteen.\\r\\nAs the last requirement for each rank, the Scout must go through the Scoutmaster's conference and then a board of review.\\r\\nThe Scoutmaster conference is a meeting between the Scoutmaster or the Coach and the Scout, and is a requirement for each rank. The Scoutmaster or Coach reviews the Scout's progress and ensures all requirements have been met. The Scout is expected to show how he has grown in his understanding of the Scouting ideals, including the Scout Oath and the Scout Law, and how he has applied those ideals. The Scoutmaster or Coach will also discuss the next steps in advancement and encourages the Scout to advance.[8]\\r\\nThe board of review is a group of three to six members of the troop or team committee and is the final approval process for Scout rank advancement. The board reviews the Scout to ensure all requirements are met and attempts to determine the Scout's attitude and his acceptance of Scouting's ideals and their application. The board also solicits the Scout's opinions on the troop or team program and on youth and adult leadership.[9]\\r\\nThe Eagle Scout board of review is convened by the council or district. Members are selected by council policy and may include troop or team committee members, district or council Eagle representatives or community members with an understanding of the Eagle board.

The badge for the Scout rank consists of a simple fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes a compass needle. The needle points the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward.[10] The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend it. The Second Class badge features a scroll inscribed with the Scout Motto, with the ends turned up and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom. The knot reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, Do a Good Turn Daily, and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service. The First Class badge combines the elements of the Tenderfoot and Second Class badges. For many years, the First Class badge was used as the emblem of the BSA. Star has a First Class symbol on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank. Life has a First Class emblem on a red heart, and initially symbolized the first-aid and health-related merit badges that the rank required. Now it signifies that the ideals of Scouting have become a part of the Scout's life and character.[11]\\r\\nThe rank insignia have been around since the beginning. The current design for the Eagle Scout badge was adopted in 1985, with minor modifications in 1986 and 1989. The Eagle Scout medal is of the same basic design as in 1915, with only occasional slight modifications due to changes in manufacturer over time, most recently in 1999. The current design of the other rank badges were finalized in 1990.\\r\\nFor the BSA's centennial year of 2010, special rank badges were available.[12] For each badge from Scout through Life, the badge design is encircled by brown lettering that says \\"2010 (Rank) Scout\\", and \\"Boy Scouts of America\\". For the Eagle badge, which already had the design surrounded by white lettering (\\"Eagle Scout\\"/\\"Boy Scouts of America\\") the only change is the addition of \\"2010\\" before \\"Eagle\\". These badges were available during 2010 only.[12]\\r\\nFor the Eagle Scout's centennial year of 2012, on the Eagle Scout badge only, it states Centennial on the writing around the badge.\\r\\nScout was previously a joining badge, but is now considered the first rank, and is earned by completing certain requirements. As of January 2016, the Scout badge has a gold fleur-de-lis on a tan background. The badge is awarded when the boy demonstrates a rudimentary knowledge of the Scouting ideals such as tying a square knot and knowing the Scout oath, law, motto, and slogan.[13]\\r\\nTenderfoot is the second rank a scout can earn.

At this point, Scouts stop focusing on the Scout skills, and start working on leadership.[4]\\r\\nOriginally, First Class was the all around Scout and the final and highest rank. Later ranks were originally recognitions of earning merit badges beyond First Class, and not properly ranks. Now these additional ranks form a second tier where Scouts can further develop leadership skills and explore potential vocations and avocations through the merit badge program.\\r\\nAlthough Eagle is the highest rank and one all Scouts should strive for, the number of Scouts achieving First Class within one year of joining is still one of the key measures of unit effectiveness. Studies[14] purportedly have shown that if a Scout achieves First Class within a year of joining, he typically stays in the Scout program for at least three years. Scouts who do so are purportedly more likely to retain Scout values as an adult and achieve the BSA primary mission of \\"producing useful citizens\\".[14]\\r\\nFrom 1972 to 1990, the First Aid merit badge was required for First Class rank. After 1990, this was replaced with a series of requirements to demonstrate awareness of advanced first aid techniques, including CPR. A sixth merit badge was added to the requirement for Star rank at that time to maintain its overall requirement of 21 merit badges, and First Aid is still one of the merit badges that is mandatory for Eagle Scout.\\r\\nStar is the rank above First Class and below Life Scout. It is the third-highest rank. Star is awarded when the Scout serves actively in the troop, team or crew in a position of responsibility for at least 4 months; performs at least six hours of community service; and earns six merit badges (four of which must be among the 13 required for Eagle Scout rank).\\r\\nInitially, the Life badge was awarded for five merit badges and the Star badge was awarded for ten. The order was reversed in the 1920s when it was decided that the five-pointed star of Star Scout better represented the five merit badges required for first rank above First Class. That symbolism disappeared when the number of merit badges required for Star was increased to six in 1990.\\r\\nLife is the second-highest rank attainable, above Star and below Eagle. Life is awarded when the Scout serves actively in the troop, team or crew, serves in a position of responsibility for six months, and performs six hours of community service.[6] A Scout must also earn five merit badges (at least three of which must be required for the rank of Eagle) for a total of 11, including the six previously earned. Finally, the Scout must pass a Scoutmaster conference, and board of review.\\r\\nLife was originally lower than Star, and originally required earning five specific merit badges concerned with health and fitness (First Aid, Lifesaving, Public Health, Personal Health and Athletics). The ranks were switched in the 1920s, following a decision to recognize the five-pointed star as a symbol of the five badges needed to earn that rank. The Life heart came to symbolize achievement in health and fitness, as the First Aid merit badge was required for both Life and Eagle until 1972, when it became required for all ranks above First Class.\\r\\nEagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the Boy Scouting division. Since its introduction in 1911, the Eagle Scout rank has been earned by more than two million young men.[15]\\r\\nRequirements include earning a minimum total of 21 merit badges, including all required badges that were not previously earned, and demonstration of Scout Spirit, service and leadership. This includes an extensive service project that the Scout plans, organizes, leads, and manages. Eagle Scouts are presented with a medal and a badge that visibly recognizes the accomplishments of the Scout. Additional recognition can be earned through Eagle Palms, awarded for completing additional tenure, leadership and merit badge requirements.","input":"What is the highest level in boy scouts?"},{"output":"investigating alleged infringements under Australia's anti-discrimination legislation in relation to Commonwealth Agencies","context":"The Australian Human Rights Commission is a national human rights institution, established in 1986 as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and renamed in 2008.

It is a formalization and extension of diversification in investing, the idea that owning different kinds of financial assets is less risky than owning only one type. Its key insight is that an asset's risk and return should not be assessed by itself, but by how it contributes to a portfolio's overall risk and return. It uses the variance of asset prices as a proxy for risk [1].\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomist Harry Markowitz introduced MPT in a 1952 essay,[2] for which he was later awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics.\\r\\n\\r\\nMPT assumes that investors are risk averse, meaning that given two portfolios that offer the same expected return, investors will prefer the less risky one.  Thus, an investor will take on increased risk only if compensated by higher expected returns. Conversely, an investor who wants higher expected returns must accept more risk. The exact trade-off will be the same for all investors, but different investors will evaluate the trade-off differently based on individual risk aversion characteristics.  The implication is that a rational investor will not invest in a portfolio if a second portfolio exists with a more favorable risk-expected return profile ÿ i.e., if for that level of risk an alternative portfolio exists that has better expected returns.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the model:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a two asset portfolio:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a three asset portfolio:\\r\\n\\r\\nAn investor can reduce portfolio risk simply by holding combinations of instruments that are not perfectly positively correlated (correlation coefficient \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n1\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\r\\nj\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle -1\\\\leq \\\\rho _{ij}<1}\\r\\n\\r\\n). In other words, investors can reduce their exposure to individual asset risk by holding a diversified portfolio of assets.  Diversification may allow for the same portfolio expected return with reduced risk. These ideas have been started with Markowitz and then reinforced by other economists and mathematicians such as Andrew Brennan who have expressed ideas in the limitation of variance through portfolio theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf all the asset pairs have correlations of 0they are perfectly uncorrelatedthe portfolio's return variance is the sum over all assets of the square of the fraction held in the asset times the asset's return variance (and the portfolio standard deviation is the square root of this sum).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf all the asset pairs have correlations of 1they are perfectly positively correlatedthen the portfolio returns standard deviation is the sum of the asset returns standard deviations weighted by the fractions held in the portfolio. For given portfolio weights and given standard deviations of asset returns, the case of all correlations being 1 gives the highest possible standard deviation of portfolio return.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis graph shows expected return (vertical) versus standard deviation.  This is called the 'risk-expected return space.'   Every possible combination of risky assets, can be plotted in this risk-expected return space, and the collection of all such possible portfolios defines a region in this space.  The left boundary of this region is a hyperbola,[3] and the upper edge of this region is the efficient frontier in the absence of a risk-free asset (sometimes called \\"the Markowitz bullet\\"). Combinations along this upper edge represent portfolios (including no holdings of the risk-free asset) for which there is lowest risk for a given level of expected return.  Equivalently, a portfolio lying on the efficient frontier represents the combination offering the best possible expected return for given risk level. The tangent to the hyperbola at the tangency point indicates the best possible capital allocation line (CAL).\\r\\n\\r\\nMatrices are preferred for calculations of the efficient frontier.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn matrix form, for a given \\"risk tolerance\\" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nq\\r\\nj\\r\\n[\\r\\n0\\r\\n,\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle q\\\\in [0,\\\\infty )}\\r\\n\\r\\n, the efficient frontier is found by minimizing the following expression:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above optimization finds the point on the frontier at which the inverse of the slope of the frontier would be q if portfolio return variance instead of standard deviation were plotted horizontally.  The frontier in its entirety is parametric on q.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Markowitz developed a specific procedure for solving the above problem, called the critical line algorithm[4], that can handle additional linear constraints, upper and lower bounds on assets, and which is proved to work with a semi-positive definite covariance matrix. Examples of implementation of the critical line algorithm exist in Visual Basic for Applications[5], in JavaScript[6] and in a few other languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, many software packages, including MATLAB, Microsoft Excel, Mathematica and R, provide generic optimization routines so that using these for solving the above problem is possible, with potential caveats (poor numerical accuracy, requirement of positive definiteness of the covariance matrix...).\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative approach to specifying the efficient frontier is to do so parametrically on the expected portfolio return \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nR\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nw\\r\\n.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle R^{T}w.}\\r\\n\\r\\n  This version of the problem requires that we minimize\\r\\n\\r\\nsubject to\\r\\n\\r\\nfor parameter \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mu }\\r\\n\\r\\n.  This problem is easily solved using a Lagrange multiplier.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne key result of the above analysis is the two mutual fund theorem.[3]  This theorem states that any portfolio on the efficient frontier can be generated by holding a combination of any two given portfolios on the frontier; the latter two given portfolios are the \\"mutual funds\\" in the theorem's name.  So in the absence of a risk-free asset, an investor can achieve any desired efficient portfolio even if all that is accessible is a pair of efficient mutual funds. If the location of the desired portfolio on the frontier is between the locations of the two mutual funds, both mutual funds will be held in positive quantities. If the desired portfolio is outside the range spanned by the two mutual funds, then one of the mutual funds must be sold short (held in negative quantity) while the size of the investment in the other mutual fund must be greater than the amount available for investment (the excess being funded by the borrowing from the other fund).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk-free asset is the (hypothetical) asset that pays a risk-free rate. In practice, short-term government securities (such as US treasury bills) are used as a risk-free asset, because they pay a fixed rate of interest and have exceptionally low default risk. The risk-free asset has zero variance in returns (hence is risk-free); it is also uncorrelated with any other asset (by definition, since its variance is zero). As a result, when it is combined with any other asset or portfolio of assets, the change in return is linearly related to the change in risk as the proportions in the combination vary.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a risk-free asset is introduced, the  half-line shown in the figure is the new efficient frontier. It is tangent to the hyperbola at the pure risky portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio.  Its vertical intercept represents a portfolio with 100% of holdings in the risk-free asset;  the tangency with the hyperbola represents a portfolio with no risk-free holdings and 100% of assets held in the portfolio occurring at the tangency point; points between those points are portfolios containing positive amounts of both the risky tangency portfolio and the risk-free asset; and points on the half-line beyond the tangency point are leveraged portfolios involving negative holdings of the risk-free asset (the latter has been sold shortin other words, the investor has borrowed at the risk-free rate) and an amount invested in the tangency portfolio equal to more than 100% of the investor's initial capital.  This efficient half-line is called the capital allocation line (CAL), and its formula can be shown to be\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this formula P is the sub-portfolio of risky assets at the tangency with the Markowitz bullet, F is the risk-free asset, and C is a combination of portfolios P and F.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the diagram, the introduction of the risk-free asset as a possible component of the portfolio has improved the range of risk-expected return combinations available, because everywhere except at the tangency portfolio the half-line gives a higher expected return than the hyperbola does at every possible risk level.  The fact that all points on the linear efficient locus can be achieved by a combination of holdings of the risk-free asset and the tangency portfolio is known as the one mutual fund theorem,[3] where the mutual fund referred to is the tangency portfolio.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above analysis describes optimal behavior of an individual investor.  Asset pricing theory builds on this analysis in the following way.  Since everyone holds the risky assets in identical proportions to each othernamely in the proportions given by the tangency portfolioin market equilibrium the risky assets' prices, and therefore their expected returns, will adjust so that the ratios in the tangency portfolio are the same as the ratios in which the risky assets are supplied to the market.  Thus relative supplies will equal relative demands. MPT derives the required expected return for a correctly priced asset in this context.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecific risk is the risk associated with individual assets - within a portfolio these risks can be reduced through diversification (specific risks \\"cancel out\\"). Specific risk is also called diversifiable, unique, unsystematic, or idiosyncratic risk. Systematic risk (a.k.a. portfolio risk or market risk) refers to the risk common to all securitiesexcept for selling short as noted below, systematic risk cannot be diversified away (within one market). Within the market portfolio, asset specific risk will be diversified away to the extent possible. Systematic risk is therefore equated with the risk (standard deviation) of the market portfolio.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince a security will be purchased only if it improves the risk-expected return characteristics of the market portfolio, the relevant measure of the risk of a security is the risk it adds to the market portfolio, and not its risk in isolation.\\r\\nIn this context, the volatility of the asset, and its correlation with the market portfolio, are historically observed and are therefore given. (There are several approaches to asset pricing that attempt to price assets by modelling the stochastic properties of the moments of assets' returns - these are broadly referred to as conditional asset pricing models.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSystematic risks within one market can be managed through a strategy of using both long and short positions within one portfolio, creating a \\"market neutral\\" portfolio. Market neutral portfolios, therefore, will be uncorrelated with broader market indices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe asset return depends on the amount paid for the asset today. The price paid must ensure that the market portfolio's risk / return characteristics improve when the asset is added to it. The CAPM is a model that derives the theoretical required expected return (i.e., discount rate) for an asset in a market, given the risk-free rate available to investors and the risk of the market as a whole. The CAPM is usually expressed:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe derivation is as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\n(1) The incremental impact on risk and expected return when an additional risky asset, a, is added to the market portfolio, m, follows from the formulae for a two-asset portfolio. These results are used to derive the asset-appropriate discount rate.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) If an asset, a, is correctly priced, the improvement in its risk-to-expected return ratio achieved by adding it to the market portfolio, m, will at least match the gains of spending that money on an increased stake in the market portfolio. The assumption is that the investor will purchase the asset with funds borrowed at the risk-free rate, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nR\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle R_{f}}\\r\\n\\r\\n; this is rational if \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nE\\r\\n?\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\nR\\r\\n\\r\\na\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n>\\r\\n\\r\\nR\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\operatorname {E} (R_{a})>R_{f}}\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis equation can be estimated statistically using the following regression equation:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere ϫi is called the asset's alpha, i is the asset's beta coefficient and SCL is the security characteristic line.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce an asset's expected return, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nE\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\nR\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle E(R_{i})}\\r\\n\\r\\n, is calculated using CAPM, the future cash flows of the asset can be discounted to their present value using this rate to establish the correct price for the asset. A riskier stock will have a higher beta and will be discounted at a higher rate; less sensitive stocks will have lower betas and be discounted at a lower rate. In theory, an asset is correctly priced when its observed price is the same as its value calculated using the CAPM derived discount rate. If the observed price is higher than the valuation, then the asset is overvalued; it is undervalued for a too low price.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its theoretical importance, critics of MPT question whether it is an ideal investment tool, because its model of financial markets does not match the real world in many ways.[7][1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk, return, and correlation measures used by MPT are based on expected values, which means that they are mathematical statements about the future (the expected value of returns is explicit in the above equations, and implicit in the definitions of variance and covariance). In practice, investors must substitute predictions based on historical measurements of asset return and volatility for these values in the equations. Very often such expected values fail to take account of new circumstances that did not exist when the historical data were generated.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore fundamentally, investors are stuck with estimating key parameters from past market data because MPT attempts to model risk in terms of the likelihood of losses, but says nothing about why those losses might occur. The risk measurements used are probabilistic in nature, not structural.  This is a major difference as compared to many engineering approaches to risk management. \\r\\n\\r\\nOptions theory and MPT have at least one important conceptual difference from the probabilistic risk assessment done by nuclear power [plants]. A PRA is what economists would call a structural model. The components of a system and their relationships are modeled in Monte Carlo simulations. If valve X fails, it causes a loss of back pressure on pump Y, causing a drop in flow to vessel Z, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the BlackÿScholes equation and MPT, there is no attempt to explain an underlying structure to price changes. Various outcomes are simply given probabilities. And, unlike the PRA, if there is no history of a particular system-level event like a liquidity crisis, there is no way to compute the odds of it. If nuclear engineers ran risk management this way, they would never be able to compute the odds of a meltdown at a particular plant until several similar events occurred in the same reactor design.\\r\\n\\r\\nMathematical risk measurements are also useful only to the degree that they reflect investors' true concernsthere is no point minimizing a variable that nobody cares about in practice.  In particular, variance is a symmetric measure that counts abnormally high returns as just as risky as abnormally low returns. The psychological phenomenon of loss aversion is the idea that investors are more concerned about losses than gains, meaning that our intuitive concept of risk is fundamentally asymmetric in nature. There many other risk measures (like coherent risk measures) might better reflect investors' true preferences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nModern portfolio theory has also been criticized because it assumes that returns follow a Gaussian distribution. Already in the 1960s, Benoit Mandelbrot and Eugene Fama showed the inadequacy of this assumption and proposed the use of stable distributions instead. Stefan Mittnik and Svetlozar Rachev presented strategies for deriving optimal portfolios in such settings.[9][10][11] More recently, financial economist Nassim Nicholas Taleb has also criticized modern portfolio theory on this ground, writing:\\r\\nAfter the stock market crash (in 1987), they rewarded two theoreticians, Harry Markowitz and William Sharpe, who built beautifully Platonic models on a Gaussian base, contributing to what is called Modern Portfolio Theory.  Simply, if you remove their Gaussian assumptions and treat prices as scalable, you are left with hot air.  The Nobel Committee could have tested the Sharpe and Markowitz modelsthey work like quack remedies sold on the Internetbut nobody in Stockholm seems to have thought about it.\\r\\nContrarian/Value investors don't buy into Modern Portfolio Theory as it depends on the Efficient Market Hypothesis and conflates fluctuations in shareprice with \\"risk\\". This risk is only an opportunity to buy or sell assets at attractive prices inasmuch as it suits one's book.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince MPT's introduction in 1952, many attempts have been made to improve the model, especially by using more realistic assumptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nPost-modern portfolio theory extends MPT by adopting non-normally distributed, asymmetric measures of risk. This helps with some of these problems, but not others.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack-Litterman model optimization is an extension of unconstrained Markowitz optimization that incorporates relative and absolute 'views' on inputs of risk and returns.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern portfolio theory is inconsistent with main axioms of rational choice theory, most notably with monotonicity axiom, stating that, if investing into portfolio X will, with probability one, return more money than investing into portfolio Y, then a rational investor should prefer X to Y. In contrast, modern portfolio theory is based on a different axiom, called variance aversion,[14]\\r\\nand may recommend to invest into Y on the basis that it has lower variance. Maccheroni et al.[15] described choice theory which is the closest possible to the modern portfolio theory, while satisfying monotonicity axiom. Alternatively, mean-deviation analysis[16]\\r\\nis a rational choice theory resulting from replacing variance by an appropriate deviation risk measure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1970s, concepts from MPT found their way into the field of regional science. In a series of seminal works, Michael Conroy[citation needed] modeled the labor force in the economy using portfolio-theoretic methods to examine growth and variability in the labor force. This was followed by a long literature on the relationship between economic growth and volatility.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recently, modern portfolio theory has been used to model the self-concept in social psychology. When the self attributes comprising the self-concept constitute a well-diversified portfolio, then psychological outcomes at the level of the individual such as mood and self-esteem should be more stable than when the self-concept is undiversified. This prediction has been confirmed in studies involving human subjects.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently, modern portfolio theory has been applied to modelling the uncertainty and correlation between documents in information retrieval. Given a query, the aim is to maximize the overall relevance of a ranked list of documents and at the same time minimize the overall uncertainty of the ranked list.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome experts apply MPT to portfolios of projects and other assets besides financial instruments.[20][21]  When MPT is applied outside of traditional financial portfolios, some differences between the different types of portfolios must be considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither of these necessarily eliminate the possibility of using MPT and such portfolios.  They simply indicate the need to run the optimization with an additional set of mathematically expressed constraints that would not normally apply to financial portfolios.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, some of the simplest elements of Modern Portfolio Theory are applicable to virtually any kind of portfolio.  The concept of capturing the risk tolerance of an investor by documenting how much risk is acceptable for a given return may be applied to a variety of decision analysis problems.  MPT uses historical variance as a measure of risk, but portfolios of assets like major projects don't have a well-defined \\"historical variance\\".  In this case, the MPT investment boundary can be expressed in more general terms like \\"chance of an ROI less than cost of capital\\" or \\"chance of losing more than half of the investment\\".  When risk is put in terms of uncertainty about forecasts and possible losses then the concept is transferable to various types of investment.[20]","input":"What is modern portfolio theory (mpt)?"},{"output":"mid-to-late 20th century","context":"The Christmas season,[1][2] also called the festive season,[3] or the holiday season (mainly in the U.S. and Canada; often simply called the holidays),[4][5], is an annually recurring period recognized in many Western and Western-influenced countries that is generally considered to run from late November to early January.[6][7][8] It is defined as incorporating at least Christmas, and usually New Year, and sometimes various other holidays and festivals.

By the late 20th century, the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah and the new African American cultural holiday of Kwanzaa began to be considered in the U.S. as being part of the \\"holiday season\\", a term that as of 2013 has become equally or more prevalent than \\"Christmas season\\" in U.S. sources to refer to the end-of-the-year festive period.[13][15][16] \\"Holiday season\\" has also spread in varying degrees to Canada;[17] however, in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the phrase \\"holiday season\\" is not widely understood to be synonymous with the ChristmasÿNew Year period, and is often instead associated with summer holidays.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSaturnalia was an ancient Roman festival in honor of the deity Saturn, held on December 17 of the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities through December 23. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms: gambling was permitted, and masters provided table service for their slaves.[19] The poet Catullus called it \\"the best of days.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe earliest source stating December 25 as the date of birth of Jesus was Hippolytus of Rome (170ÿ236), written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the Spring equinox which he placed on March 25, and then added nine months.[21] There is historical evidence that by the middle of the 4th century the Christian churches of the East celebrated the birth and Baptism of Jesus on the same day, on January 6 while those in the West celebrated a Nativity feast on December 25 (perhaps influenced by the Winter solstice); and that by the last quarter of the 4th century, the calendars of both churches included both feasts.[22] The earliest suggestions of a fast of Baptism of Jesus on January 6 during the 2nd century comes from Clement of Alexandria, but there is no further mention of such a feast until 361 when Emperor Julian attended a feast on January 6 in the year 361.[22]\\r\\nIn the Christian tradition the Christmas season is a period beginning on Christmas Day (December 25). In some churches (e.g. the Anglican Communion) the season continues until the day before the Epiphany, which is celebrated either on January 6 or on the Sunday between January 2 and 8. In other churches (e.g. the Roman Catholic Church) it continues until the feast of the Baptism of the Lord, which falls on the Sunday following the Epiphany, or on the Monday following the Epiphany if the Epiphany is moved to January 7 or 8. If the Epiphany is kept on January 6, the Church of England's use of the term Christmas season corresponds to the Twelve Days of Christmas, and ends on Twelfth Night.\\r\\nThis short Christmas season is preceded by Advent, which begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas Day: the majority of the secularized Christmas and holiday season falls during Advent. The Anglican Communion and some Protestant churches follow the Christmas season with an Epiphany season which lasts until Shrove Tuesday which is also known as Mardi Gras or 'Fat Tuesday'. Other European cultures have their own carnival festivities between new year and Lent.\\r\\nAccording to Yanovski et al.,[7] in the United States the holiday season \\"is generally considered to begin with the day after Thanksgiving and end after New Year's Day\\". According to Axelrad,[8] the season in the United States encompasses at least Christmas and New Year's Day, and also includes Saint Nicholas Day. The U.S. Fire Administration[23] defines the \\"Winter Holiday Season\\" as the period from December 1 to January 7. According to Chen et al.,[24] in China the Christmas and holiday season \\"is generally considered to begin with the winter solstice and end after the Lantern Festival\\". Some stores and shopping malls advertise their Christmas merchandise beginning after Halloween or even in late October, alongside Halloween items. In the UK and Ireland, Christmas food generally appears on supermarket shelves as early as September or even August, while the Christmas shopping season itself starts from mid November when the high street Christmas lights are switched on.[25][26]\\r\\nThe precise definition of feasts and festival days that are encompassed by the Christmas and holiday season has become controversial in the United States over recent decades. While in other countries the only holidays included in the \\"season\\" are Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day/Boxing Day, New Year's Eve, New Year's Day and Epiphany, in recent times, this definition in the U.S. has begun to expand to include Yule, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.[27] The expansion of the holiday season in the U.S. to encompass Thanksgiving is believed to have begun in the 1920s, when major department stores Macy's and Gimbels launched dueling Thanksgiving Day parades to promote Christmas sales.[28] Due to the phenomenon of Christmas creep and the informal inclusion of Thanksgiving, the Christmas and holiday season has begun to extend earlier into the year, overlapping Veterans/Remembrance/Armistice Day, Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night.\\r\\nThe exchange of gifts is central to the Christmas and holiday season, and the season thus also incorporates a \\"holiday shopping season\\". This comprises a peak time for the retail sector at the start of the holiday season (the \\"Christmas shopping season\\") and a period of sales at the end of the season, the \\"January sales\\".\\r\\nAlthough once dedicated mostly to white sales and clearance sales, the January sales now comprise both winter close-out sales and sales comprising the redemption of gift cards given as presents.[29][30] Young-Bean Song, director of analytics at the Atlas Institute in Seattle, states that it is a \\"myth that the holiday shopping season starts with Thanksgiving and ends with Christmas. January is a key part of the holiday season.\\" stating that for the U.S. e-commerce sector January sales volumes matched December sales volumes in the 2004/2005 Christmas and holiday season.[31]\\r\\nMany people find this time particularly stressful.[32] As a remedy, and as a return to what they perceive as the root of Christmas, some practice alternative giving.\\r\\nIn the United States, the holiday season is a particularly important time for retail shopping, with shoppers spending more than $600 billion during the 2013 holiday season, averaging about $767 per person. During the 2014 holiday shopping season, retail sales in the United States increased to a total of over $616 billion, and in 2015, retail sales in the United States increased to a total of over $630 billion, up from 2014's $616 billion. The average US holiday shopper spent on average $805. More than half of it was spent on family shopping.[33]\\r\\nIt is traditionally considered to commence on the day after American Thanksgiving, a Friday colloquially known as either Black Friday or Green Friday. This is widely reputed to be the busiest shopping day of the entire calendar year. However, in 2004 the VISA credit card organization reported that over the previous several years VISA credit card spending had in fact been 8 to 19 percent higher on the last Saturday before Christmas Day (i.e., Super Saturday) than on Black Friday.[34] A survey conducted in 2005 by GfK NOP discovered that \\"Americans aren't as drawn to Black Friday as many retailers may think\\", with only 17% of those polled saying that they will begin holiday shopping immediately after Thanksgiving, 13% saying that they plan to finish their shopping before November 24 and 10% waiting until the very last day before performing their holiday gift shopping.[35]\\r\\nAccording to a survey by the Canadian Toy Association, peak sales in the toy industry occur in the Christmas and holiday season, but this peak has been occurring later and later in the season every year.[36]\\r\\nIn 2005, the kick-off to the Christmas and holiday season for online shopping, the first Monday after US Thanksgiving, was named Cyber Monday. Although it was a peak, that was not the busiest on-line shopping day of that year. The busiest on-line shopping days were December 12 and 13, almost two weeks later; the second Monday in December has since become known as Green Monday. Another notable day is Free Shipping Day, a promotional day that serves as the last day in which a person can order a good online and have it arrive via standard shipping (the price of which the sender pays) prior to Christmas Eve; this day is usually on or near December 16.[37] Four of the largest 11 on-line shopping days in 2005 were December 11 to 16, with an increase of 12% over 2004 figures.[38] In 2011, Cyber Monday was slightly busier than Green Monday and Free Shipping Day, although all three days registered sales of over US$1 billion, and all three days registered gains ranging from 14% to 22% over the previous year.[37] Analysts had predicted the peak on December 12, noting that Mondays are the most popular days for on-line shopping during the holiday shopping season, in contrast to the middle of the week during the rest of the year. They attribute this to people \\"shopping in stores and malls on the weekends, and [...] extending that shopping experience when they get into work on Monday\\" by \\"looking for deals, [...] comparison shopping and [...] finding items that were out of stock in the stores\\".[31]\\r\\nIn 2006, the average US household was expected to spend about $1,700 on Christmas and holiday spendings.[39] Retail strategists such as ICSC Research[40] observed in 2005 that 15% of holiday expenditures were in the form of gift certificates, a percentage that was rising. So they recommended that retailers manage their inventories for the entire holiday shopping season, with a leaner inventory at the start and new winter merchandise for the January sales.\\r\\nMichael P. Niemira, chief economist and director of research for the Shopping Center Council, states that he expects gift certificate usage to be between US$30billion and US$40billion in the 2006/2007 holiday shopping season. On the basis of the growing popularity of gift certificates, he states that \\"To get a true picture of holiday sales, one may consider measuring October, November, December and January sales combined as opposed to just November and December sales.\\", because with \\"a hefty amount of that spending not hitting the books until January, extending the length of the season makes sense\\".[41]\\r\\nAccording to the Deloitte 2007 Holiday Survey,[42] for the fourth straight year, gift cards are expected to be the top gift purchase in 2007, with more than two-thirds (69 percent) of consumers surveyed planning to buy them, compared with 66 percent in 2006. In addition, holiday shoppers are planning to buy even more cards this year: an average of 5.5 cards, compared with the 4.6 cards they planned to buy last year. One in six consumers (16 percent) plan to buy 10 or more cards, compared with 11 percent last year. Consumers are also spending more in total on gift cards and more per card: $36.25 per card on average compared with $30.22 last year. Gift cards continue to grow in acceptance: Almost four in 10 consumers surveyed (39 percent) would rather get a gift card than merchandise, an increase from last years 35 percent. Also, resistance to giving gift cards continues to decline: 19 percent say they dont like to give gift cards because theyre too impersonal (down from 22 percent last year). Consumers said that the cards are popular gifts for adults, teens and children alike, and almost half (46 percent) intend to buy them for immediate family; however, they are hesitant to buy them for spouses or significant others, with only 14 percent saying they plan to buy them for those recipients.\\r\\nSome stores in Canada hold Boxing Week sales (before the end of the year) for income tax purposes.\\r\\nWhat has become known as \\"Christmas creep\\" refers to a merchandising phenomenon in which merchants and retailers exploit the commercialized status of Christmas by moving up the start of the holiday shopping season.[43] The term was first used in the mid-1980s,[44] and is associated with a desire of merchants to take advantage of particularly heavy Christmas-related shopping well before Black Friday in the United States and before Halloween in Canada.\\r\\nThe term is not used in the UK and Ireland, where retailers call Christmas the \\"golden quarter\\", that is, the three months of October through December is the quarter of the year in which the retail industry hopes to make the most profit.[45] It can apply for other holidays as well, notably Valentine's Day, Easter and Mother's Day.\\r\\nIn the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, the Christmas shopping season starts from mid-November, around the time when high street Christmas lights are turned on.[25][26] In the UK in 2010, up to S8 billion was expected to be spent online at Christmas, approximately a quarter of total retail festive sales.[26] Retailers in the UK call Christmas the \\"golden quarter\\", that is, the three months of October to December is the quarter of the year in which the retail industry hopes to make the most money.[45] In Ireland, around early December or late November each year, The Late Late Toy Show is broadcast on Irish television, which features all the popular toys throughout the year being demonstrated and showcased before the holiday season and shopping sprees commence.\\r\\nThe Netherlands and Belgium have a double holiday. The first one, the arrival of the Bishop Saint Nicholas and Black Peter, starts about mid November, with presents being given on December 5 or 6. This is a separate holiday from Christmas, Bishop Saint Nick (Sinterklaas) and Santa Claus (Kerstman) being different people. Netherlands and Belgium often do not start the Christmas season until December 6 or 7, i.e. after Sinterklaas has finished.\\r\\nIn France, the January sales are restricted by legislation to no more than four weeks in Paris, and no more than six weeks for the rest of the country, usually beginning on the first Wednesday in January, and are one of only two periods of the year when retailers are permitted to hold sales.[46][47]\\r\\nIn Italy, the January sales begin on the first weekend in January, and last for at least six weeks.[46]\\r\\nIn Croatia and Bosnia (predominantly Sarajevo) the sales periods are regulated by the Consumer Protection Act. The January sales period starts on December 27 and can last up to 60 days.[48]\\r\\nIn Germany, the Winterschlussverkauf (winter sale before the season ends) was one of two official sales periods (the other being the Sommerschlussverkauf, the summer sales). It begins on the last Monday in January and lasts for 12 days, selling left-over goods from the holiday shopping season, as well as the winter collections. However, unofficially, goods are sold at reduced prices by many stores throughout the whole of January. By the time the sales officially begin the only goods left on sale are low-quality ones, often specially manufactured for the sales.[49][50] Since a legislative reform to the corresponding law in 2004,[51] season sales are now allowed over the whole year and are no longer restricted to season-related goods. However, voluntary sales still called \\"Winterschlussverkauf\\" take place further on in most stores at the same time every year.\\r\\nIn Sweden, where the week of the first Advent Sunday marks the official start of the Christmas and holiday season, continuing with Saint Lucy's Day on December 13, followed up by Christmas before the Mellandagsrea (between days sell off) traditionally begins on December 27 (nowadays often December 26 or even December 25) and lasts during the rest of the Christmas holiday. It is similar to Black Friday, but lasts longer. They last 34ÿ35 days. Black Friday itself has also gained publicity in Sweden since the early-2010s. The Swedish Christmas and holiday season continues over Epiphany, and finally ends on St. Knut's Day when the children have a Knut's party.[52]\\r\\nIn Bosnia (Republika Srpska), Montenegro and Serbia, holiday sales starts in the middle of December and last for at least one month.\\r\\nHong Kong, China has a lot of seasonal activities and traditions to offer around Christmas time. December 25 and 26 are Public Holidays that makes most shops open for shopping. Locals and tourists love to watch the 30-meter Swarovski Christmas tree in the Central as well as the Christmas light displays on buildings on Victoria Harbour.[53] A huge party in Hong Kong called Winterfest is celebrated every year which involves malls, shops, theme parks and other attractions.\\r\\nThe Philippines has the longest Christmas season, reportedly.[54] As early as September up until January 9, which is the feast of the Black Nazarene (the season ends on the Feast of the Lord's Baptism on the 2nd Sunday of January or the Monday after Epiphany if the 2nd Sunday is marked as such), Carolers can be typically heard going door to door serenading fellow Filipinos in exchange of money. All over the entire country, parols (star shaped lanterns) are hung everywhere and lights are lit. Simbang Gabi or dawn masses start December 16 and run for nine days up until Christmas Eve.[55]\\r\\nSouth Korea's population are 30% Christian[56] and Christmas is a Public Holiday. According to the Washington Post, \\"Koreans prefer cash Christmas gifts over more creative presents.\\"[57]\\r\\nSingapore widely celebrates Christmas which is a Public Holiday in this country. For six weeks, mid-November to early January, the 2.2-kilometre (1.4?mi) stretch of Orchard Road glitters with lights from decorated trees and building facades of malls and hotels.\\r\\nA selection of goodwill greetings are often used around the world to address strangers, family, colleagues or friends during the season. Some greetings are more prevalent than others, depending on culture and location. Traditionally, the predominant greetings of the season have been \\"Merry Christmas\\", \\"Happy Christmas\\", and \\"Happy New Year\\". In the mid-to-late 20th century in the United States, more generic greetings such as \\"Happy Holidays\\" and \\"Season's Greetings\\" began to rise in cultural prominence, and this would later spread to other Western countries including Canada, Australia and to a lesser extent some European countries. A 2012 poll by Rasmussen Reports indicated that 68% of Americans prefer the use of \\"Merry Christmas\\", while 23% preferred \\"Happy Holidays\\".[14] A similarly-timed Canadian poll conducted by Ipsos-Reid indicated that 72% of Canadians preferred \\"Merry Christmas\\".[17]\\r\\nThe greetings and farewells \\"Merry Christmas\\" and \\"Happy Christmas\\" are traditionally used in English-speaking countries, starting a few weeks before Christmas (December 25) each year.\\r\\nVariations are:\\r\\nThese greetings and their equivalents in other languages are popular not only in countries with large Christian populations but also in the largely non-Christian nations of China and Japan, where Christmas is celebrated primarily due to cultural influences of predominantly Christian countries. They have somewhat decreased in popularity in the United States and Canada in recent decades, but polls in 2005 indicated that they remained more popular than \\"Happy Holidays\\" or other alternatives.[58]\\r\\n\\"Merry,\\" derived from the Old English myrige, originally meant merely \\"pleasant, agreeable\\" rather than joyous or jolly (as in the phrase \\"merry month of May\\").[59] Christmas has been celebrated since the 4th century AD, the first known usage of any Christmas greeting dates was in 1534.[60] \\"Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\\" (thus incorporating two greetings) was in an informal letter written by an English admiral in 1699. The same phrase is contained in the title of the English carol \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas,\\" and also appears in the first commercial Christmas card, produced by Henry Cole in England in 1843.[61]\\r\\nAlso in 1843, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol was published, during the mid Victorian revival of the holiday. The word Merry was then beginning to take on its current meaning of \\"jovial, cheerful, jolly and outgoing\\".[59] \\"Merry Christmas\\" in this new context figured prominently in A Christmas Carol. The cynical Ebenezer Scrooge rudely deflects the friendly greeting: \\"If I could work my will  every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding.\\"[62] After the visit from the Ghosts of Christmas effects his transformation, Scrooge exclaims; \\"I am as merry as a school-boy. A merry Christmas to everybody!\\" and heartily exchanges the wish to all he meets.[63] The instant popularity of A Christmas Carol, the Victorian era Christmas traditions it typifies, and the term's new meaning appearing in the book popularized the phrase \\"Merry Christmas\\".[64][65]\\r\\nThe alternative \\"Happy Christmas\\" gained usage in the late 19th century, and in the UK and Ireland is a common spoken greeting, along with \\"Merry Christmas\\". One reason may be the Victorian middle class influence in attempting to separate wholesome celebration of the Christmas season from public insobriety and associated asocial behaviour, at a time when merry also meant \\"intoxicated\\" ÿ Queen Elizabeth II is said to prefer \\"Happy Christmas\\" for this reason.[59] In her annual Christmas messages to the Commonwealth, Queen Elizabeth has used \\"happy Christmas\\" far more often than \\"merry Christmas\\".[66]\\r\\nIn the American poet Clement Moore's \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" (1823), the final line, originally written as \\"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night\\", has been changed in many later editions to \\"Merry Christmas to all\\", perhaps indicating the relative popularity of the phrases in the US.\\r\\nIn the United States, \\"Happy Holidays\\" (along with the similarly generalized \\"Season's Greetings\\") has become a common holiday greeting in the public sphere of department stores, public schools and greeting cards. Its use is generally confined to the period between United States Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.[citation needed] The phrase \\"Happy Holidays\\" has been used as a Christmas greeting in the United States for more than 100 years.[67]\\r\\nThe increasing usage of \\"Happy Holidays\\" has been the subject of some controversy in the United States. Advocates claim that \\"Happy Holidays\\" is an inclusive greeting that is not intended as an attack on Christianity or other religions, but is rather a response to what they say is the reality of a growing non-Christian population.\\r\\nCritics of \\"Happy Holidays\\" generally claim it is a secular neologism. The greeting may be deemed materialistic, consumerist, atheistic, indifferentist, agnostic, politically correct and/or anti-Christianity. Critics of the phrase have associated it with a larger cultural clash termed the \\"War on Christmas\\".[67][68]\\r\\n\\"Season's Greetings\\" is a greeting more commonly used as a motto on winter season greeting cards, and in commercial advertisements, than as a spoken phrase. In addition to \\"Merry Christmas\\", Victorian Christmas cards bore a variety of salutations, including \\"Compliments of the Season\\" and \\"Christmas Greetings.\\" By the late 19th century, \\"With the Season's Greetings\\" or simply \\"The Season's Greetings\\" began appearing. By the 1920s it had been shortened to \\"Season's Greetings\\",[69] and has been a greeting card fixture ever since. Several White House Christmas cards, including U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's 1955 card, have featured the phrase.[70]\\r\\nVarious studies have been performed on the effects of the Christmas and holiday season, which encompasses several feast days, on health. They have concluded that the health changes that occur during the Christmas and holiday season are not reversed during the rest of the year and have a long-term cumulative effect over a person's life, and that the risks of several medical problems increase during the Christmas and holiday season.\\r\\nYanovski et al.[7] investigated the assertion that the average American gains weight over the season. They found that average weight gain over the Christmas and holiday season is around 0.48 kilograms (1.1?lb). They also found that this weight gain is not reversed over the rest of the year, and concluded that this \\"probably contributes to the increase in body weight that frequently occurs during adulthood\\" (cf Lent).\\r\\nChan et al.[24] investigated the increases in A1C and fasting plasma glucose in type 2 diabetic patients, to see whether these increases were steady throughout the year or varied seasonally. They concluded that the winter holidays did influence the glycemic control of the patients, with the largest increases being during that period, increases that \\"might not be reversed during the summer and autumn months\\".\\r\\nThe Christmas and holiday season, according to a survey by the ADA, is the second most popular reason, after birthdays, for sharing food in the workplace. The British Columbia Safety Council states that if proper food safety procedures are not followed, food set out for sharing in the workplace can serve as a breeding ground for bacteria, and recommends that perishable foods (for which it gives pizza, cold cuts, dips, salads, and sandwiches as examples) should not sit out for more than 2 hours.[71]\\r\\nA survey conducted in 2005 found shopping caused headaches in nearly a quarter of people and sleeplessness in 11 percent.[32]\\r\\nPhillips et al.[72] investigated whether some or all of the spike in cardiac mortality that occurs during December and January could be ascribed to the Christmas/New Year's holidays rather than to climatic factors. They concluded that the Christmas and holiday season is \\"a risk factor for cardiac and noncardiac mortality\\", stating that there are \\"multiple explanations for this association, including the possibility that holiday-induced delays in seeking treatment play a role in producing the twin holiday spikes\\".\\r\\nThe Asthma Society of Canada[73] states that the Christmas and holiday season increases exposure to irritants because people spend 90% of their time indoors, and that seasonal decorations in the home introduce additional, further, irritants beyond the ones that exist all year around. It recommends that asthmatics avoid scented candles, for example, recommending either that candles not be lit or that soy or beeswax candles be employed.\\r\\nAccording to the Stanford Recycling Center[74] Americans throw away 25% more trash during the Christmas and holiday season than at other times of the year.\\r\\nBecause of the cold weather in the Northern Hemisphere, the Christmas and holiday season (as well as the second half of winter) is a time of increased use of fuel for domestic heating. This has prompted concerns in the United Kingdom about the possibility of a shortage in the domestic gas supply. However, in the event of an exceptionally long cold season, it is industrial users, signed on to interruptible supply contracts, who would find themselves without gas supply.[75]\\r\\nThe U.S. Fire Administration[23] states that the Christmas and holiday season is \\"a time of elevated risk for winter heating fires\\" and that the fact that many people celebrate the different holidays during the Christmas and holiday season by decorating their homes with seasonal garlands, electric lights, candles, and banners, has the potential to change the profile of fire incidence and cause. The Government of Alberta Ministry of Municipal Affairs[76] states that candle-related fires rise by 140% during the Christmas and holiday season, with most fires involving human error and most deaths and injuries resulting from the failure to extinguish candles before going to bed. It states that consumers don't expect candle holders to tip over or to catch fire, assuming that they are safe, but that in fact candle holders can do this.\\r\\nBecause of increased alcohol consumption at festivities and poorer road conditions during the winter months, alcohol-related road traffic accidents increase over the Christmas and holiday season.[77]\\r\\nIn the United States, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States has had significant legal impact upon the activities of governments and of state-funded public schools during and relating to the Christmas and holiday season, and has been the source of controversy.\\r\\nPublic schools are subject to what the Anti-Defamation League terms the \\"December Dilemma\\",[78] namely the task of \\"acknowledging the various religious and secular holiday traditions celebrated during that time of year\\" whilst restricting observances of the various religious festivals to what is constitutionally permissible. The ADL and many school district authorities have published guidelines for schools and for teachers.[79] For example: The directive on maintaining religious neutrality in public schools over the Christmas and holiday season, given to public school administrators in the District of Columbia by the Superintendent,[80] contains several points on what may and may not be taught in the D.C. school district, the themes of parties and concerts, the uses of religious symbols, the locations of school events and classes and prayer.\\r\\nIn 2002, for the Christmas and holiday season, Moscow mayor Yuriy Luzhkov ordered all stores, restaurants, cafs and markets to display seasonal decorations and lights in their windows and interiors from December 1 onwards. Banks, post offices and public institutions were to do the same from December 15, with violators liable for fines of up to 200 rubles. Every business was ordered to have illuminated windows during the hours of 16:30 until 01:00. This caused a mixed reaction, with people objecting to being forced to put up decorations.[81]","input":"When was the term happy holidays first used?"},{"output":"September 3, 1783","context":"The Treaty of Paris, signed in Paris by representatives of King George III of Great Britain and representatives of the United States of America on September 3, 1783, ended the American Revolutionary War. The treaty set the boundaries between the British Empire in North America and the United States, on lines \\"exceedingly generous\\" to the latter.[2] Details included fishing rights and restoration of property and prisoners of war.\\r\\nThis treaty and the separate peace treaties between Great Britain and the nations that supported the American cause  France, Spain, and the Dutch Republic  are known collectively as the Peace of Paris.[3][4] Only Article 1 of the treaty, which acknowledges the United States' existence as free sovereign and independent states, remains in force.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeace negotiations began in April 1782, and continued through the summer. Representing the United States were Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, Henry Laurens, and John Adams. David Hartley and Richard Oswald represented Great Britain. The treaty was signed at the Hotel d'York (presently 56 Rue Jacob) in Paris on September 3, 1783, by Adams, Franklin, Jay, and Hartley.[6]\\r\\nRegarding the American Treaty, the key episodes came in September 1782, when French Foreign Minister Vergennes proposed a solution that was strongly opposed by his ally, the United States. France was exhausted by the war, and everyone wanted peace except for Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it could capture Gibraltar from the British. Vergennes came up with the deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take the area north of the Ohio River. In the area south of that would be set up an independent Indian state under Spanish control. It would be an Indian barrier state.[7]\\r\\nHowever, the Americans realized that they could get a better deal directly from London. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain. The British Prime Minister Lord Shelburne agreed. He was in charge of the British negotiations (some of which took place in his study at Lansdowne House, now a bar in the Lansdowne Club) and he now saw a chance to split the United States away from France and make the new country a valuable economic partner.[8] The western terms were that the United States would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada. The northern boundary would be almost the same as today.[9] The United States would gain fishing rights off Canadian coasts, and agreed to allow British merchants and Loyalists to try to recover their property. It was a highly favorable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the British point of view. Prime Minister Shelburne foresaw highly profitable two-way trade between Britain and the rapidly growing United States, as indeed came to pass.[10]\\r\\nGreat Britain also signed separate agreements with France and Spain, and (provisionally) with the Netherlands.[11] In the treaty with Spain, the territories of East and West Florida were ceded to Spain (without a clear northern boundary, resulting in a territorial dispute resolved by the Treaty of Madrid in 1795). Spain also received the island of Menorca; the Bahama Islands, Grenada, and Montserrat, captured by the French and Spanish, were returned to Britain. The treaty with France was mostly about exchanges of captured territory (France's only net gains were the island of Tobago, and Senegal in Africa), but also reinforced earlier treaties, guaranteeing fishing rights off Newfoundland. Dutch possessions in the East Indies, captured in 1781, were returned by Britain to the Netherlands in exchange for trading privileges in the Dutch East Indies, by a treaty which was not finalized until 1784.[12]\\r\\nThe United States Congress of the Confederation ratified the Treaty of Paris on January 14, 1784. Copies were sent back to Europe for ratification by the other parties involved, the first reaching France in March 1784. British ratification occurred on April 9, 1784, and the ratified versions were exchanged in Paris on May 12, 1784.[13]\\r\\nPreamble. Declares the treaty to be \\"in the name of the most holy and undivided Trinity\\", states the bona fides of the signatories, and declares the intention of both parties to \\"forget all past misunderstandings and differences\\" and \\"secure to both perpetual peace and harmony\\".\\r\\nEschatocol. \\"Done at Paris, this third day of September in the year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three.\\"\\r\\nHistorians have often commented that the treaty was very generous to the United States in terms of greatly enlarged boundaries. Historians such as Alvord, Harlow, and Ritcheson have emphasized that British generosity was based on a statesmanlike vision of close economic ties between Britain and the United States. The concession of the vast trans-Appalachian region was designed to facilitate the growth of the American population and create lucrative markets for British merchants, without any military or administrative costs to Britain.[15] The point was the United States would become a major trading partner. As the French foreign minister Vergennes later put it, \\"The English buy peace rather than make it\\".[2] Vermont was included within the boundaries because the state of New York insisted that Vermont was a part of New York, although Vermont was then under a government that considered Vermont not to be a part of the United States.[16]\\r\\nPrivileges that the Americans had received from Britain automatically when they had colonial status (including protection from pirates in the Mediterranean Sea; see: the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War) were withdrawn. Individual states ignored federal recommendations, under Article 5, to restore confiscated Loyalist property, and also ignored Article 6 (e.g., by confiscating Loyalist property for \\"unpaid debts\\"). Some, notably Virginia, also defied Article 4 and maintained laws against payment of debts to British creditors. The British often ignored the provision of Article 7 about removal of slaves.[17]\\r\\nThe actual geography of North America turned out not to match the details used in the treaty. The Treaty specified a southern boundary for the United States, but the separate Anglo-Spanish agreement did not specify a northern boundary for Florida, and the Spanish government assumed that the boundary was the same as in the 1763 agreement by which they had first given their territory in Florida to Britain. While that West Florida Controversy continued, Spain used its new control of Florida to block American access to the Mississippi, in defiance of Article 8.[18] The treaty stated that the boundary of the United States extended from the \\"most northwesternmost point\\" of the Lake of the Woods (now partly in Minnesota, partly in Manitoba, and partly in Ontario) directly westward until it reached the Mississippi River. But in fact the Mississippi does not extend that far northward; the line going west from the Lake of the Woods never intersects the river.\\r\\nGreat Britain violated the treaty stipulation that they should relinquish control of forts in United States territory \\"with all convenient speed.\\" British troops remained stationed at six forts in the Great Lakes region, plus two at the north end of Lake Champlain. The British also built an additional fort in present-day Ohio in 1794, during the Northwest Indian War. They found justification for these actions in the unstable and extremely tense situation that existed in the area following the war, in the failure of the United States government to fulfill commitments made to compensate loyalists for their losses, and in the British need for time to liquidate various assets in the region.[19] All posts were relinquished peacefully through diplomatic means as a result of the 1794 Jay Treaty.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 3,010,232[5] making it the third-most populous county in California, the sixth-most populous in the United States, and more populous than twenty-one U.S. states.[7] Its county seat is Santa Ana.[8] It is the second most densely populated county in the state, second only to San Francisco County.[9] The county's four largest cities, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Irvine, and Huntington Beach each have populations exceeding 200,000. Several of Orange County's cities are on the Pacific coast, including Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana Point, and San Clemente.\\r\\nOrange County is included in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area. Thirty-four incorporated cities are located in the county; the newest is Aliso Viejo, which was incorporated in 2001. Anaheim was the first city, incorporated in 1870, when the region was still part of neighboring Los Angeles County. Whereas most population centers in the United States tend to be identified by a major city, there is no defined urban center in Orange County. It is mostly suburban except for some traditionally urban areas at the centers of the older cities of Anaheim, Fullerton, Huntington Beach, Orange, and Santa Ana. There are several edge city-style developments such as Irvine Business Center, Newport Center, and South Coast Metro.\\r\\nThe county is known for tourism with attractions like Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, and several popular beaches along its more than 40 miles (64?km) of coastline. It is also known for its political conservatisma 2005 academic study listed three Orange County cities as among America's 25 most conservative, making it one of two counties in the nation containing more than one such city. (Maricopa County, Arizona also had three cities on the list.[10]) It is part of the Tech Coast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the Tongva, Juane?o, and Luise?o Native American groups long inhabited the area. After the 1769 expedition of Gaspar de Portol, a Spanish expedition led by Junipero Serra named the area Valle de Santa Ana (Valley of Saint Anne). On November 1, 1776, Mission San Juan Capistrano became the area's first permanent European settlement. Among those who came with Portol were Jos Manuel Nieto and Jos Antonio Yorba. Both these men were given land grantsRancho Los Nietos and Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, respectively. The Nieto heirs were granted land in 1834. The Nieto ranches were known as Rancho Los Alamitos, Rancho Las Bolsas, and Rancho Los Coyotes. Yorba heirs Bernardo Yorba and Teodosio Yorba were also granted Rancho Ca?܇n de Santa Ana (Santa Ana Canyon Ranch) and Rancho Lomas de Santiago, respectively. Other ranchos in Orange County were granted by the Mexican government during the Mexican period in Alta California.[11]\\r\\nA severe drought in the 1860s devastated the prevailing industry, cattle ranching, and much land came into the possession of Richard O'Neill, Sr.,[12] James Irvine and other land barons. In 1887, silver was discovered in the Santa Ana Mountains, attracting settlers via the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Railroads.\\r\\nThis growth led the California legislature to divide Los Angeles County and create Orange County as a separate political entity on March 11, 1889. The county is said to have been named for the citrus fruit in an attempt to promote immigration by suggesting a semi-tropical paradiseÿa place where anything could grow.[13]\\r\\nOther citrus crops, avocados, and oil extraction were also important to the early economy. Orange County benefited from the July 4, 1904 completion of the Pacific Electric Railway, a trolley connecting Los Angeles with Santa Ana and Newport Beach. The link made Orange County an accessible weekend retreat for celebrities of early Hollywood. It was deemed so significant that Pacific City changed its name to Huntington Beach in honor of Henry E. Huntington, president of the Pacific Electric and nephew of Collis Huntington. Transportation further improved with the completion of the State Route and U.S. Route 101 (now mostly Interstate 5) in the 1920s.\\r\\nAgriculture, such as that involving the boysenberries made famous by Buena Park native Walter Knott, began to decline after World War II. However, the county's prosperity soared during this time. The completion of Interstate 5 in 1954 helped make Orange County a bedroom community for many who moved to Southern California to work in aerospace and manufacturing. Orange County received a further boost in 1955 with the opening of Disneyland.\\r\\nIn 1969, Yorba Linda-born Orange County native Richard Nixon became the 37th President of the United States.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, Orange County had become the second most populous county in California as the population topped two million for the first time.\\r\\nIn 1994, an investment fund meltdown led to the criminal prosecution of treasurer Robert Citron. The county lost at least $1.5 billion through high-risk investments in bonds. The loss was blamed on derivatives by some media reports.[14] On December 6, 1994, the County of Orange declared Chapter 9 bankruptcy,[14] from which it emerged on June 12, 1996.[15] The Orange County bankruptcy was at the time the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.[14]\\r\\nIn recent years, land use conflicts have arisen between established areas in the north and less developed areas in the south. These conflicts have regarded issues such as construction of new toll roads and the repurposing of a decommissioned air base. El Toro Marine Corps Air Station was designated by a voter measure in 1994 to be developed into an international airport to complement the existing John Wayne Airport. But subsequent voter initiatives and court actions have caused the airport plan to be permanently shelved. Instead, it will become the Orange County Great Park.[16]\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 948 square miles (2,460?km2), of which 791 square miles (2,050?km2) is land and 157 square miles (410?km2) (16.6%) is water.[17] It is the smallest county in Southern California. The average annual temperature is about 68?F (20?C).\\r\\nOrange County is bordered on the southwest by the Pacific Ocean, on the north by Los Angeles County, on the northeast by San Bernardino County and Riverside County, and on the southeast by San Diego County.\\r\\nThe northwestern part of the county lies on the coastal plain of the Los Angeles Basin, while the southeastern end rises into the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains. Most of Orange County's population reside in one of two shallow coastal valleys that lie in the basin, the Santa Ana Valley and the Saddleback Valley. The Santa Ana Mountains lie within the eastern boundaries of the county and of the Cleveland National Forest. The high point is Santiago Peak (5,689 feet (1,734?m)[18]), about 20?mi (32?km) east of Santa Ana. Santiago Peak and nearby Modjeska Peak, just 200 feet (60?m) shorter, form a ridge known as Saddleback, visible from almost everywhere in the county. The Peralta Hills extend westward from the Santa Ana Mountains through the communities of Anaheim Hills, Orange, and ending in Olive. The Loma Ridge is another prominent feature, running parallel to the Santa Ana Mountains through the central part of the county, separated from the taller mountains to the east by Santiago Canyon.\\r\\nThe Santa Ana River is the county's principal watercourse, flowing through the middle of the county from northeast to southwest. Its major tributary to the south and east is Santiago Creek. Other watercourses within the county include Aliso Creek, San Juan Creek, and Horsethief Creek. In the North, the San Gabriel River also briefly crosses into Orange County and exits into the Pacific on the Los Angeles-Orange County line between the cities of Long Beach and Seal Beach. Laguna Beach is home to the county's only natural lakes, Laguna Lakes, which are formed by water rising up against an underground fault.\\r\\nResidents sometimes divide the county into north Orange County and south Orange County. In effect, this is a division of the county into northwestern and southeastern halves following the county's natural diagonal orientation along the coast. This is more of a cultural and demographic distinction perpetuated by the popular television shows The OC, The Real Housewives of Orange County and Laguna Beach. The distinction exists between the older areas closer to Los Angeles and the more affluent and recently developed areas to the south. A transition between older and newer development may be considered to exist roughly parallel to State Route 55, also known as the Costa Mesa Freeway. This transition is accentuated by large flanking tracts of sparsely developed area occupied until recent years by agriculture and military airfields.\\r\\nWhile there is a northeast to southwest topographic transition from elevated areas inland to the lower coastal band, there is no formal geographic division between North and South County. Perpendicular to that gradient, the Santa Ana River roughly divides the county into northwestern and southeastern sectors. Each sector comprises 40 to 60 percent of the county respectively by area. There are significant political, demographic, economic, and cultural distinctions between North and South Orange County, with North Orange County having greater populations of people of color, younger populations, greater percentages of renters, lower median incomes, higher rates of unemployment, and greater proportions of voters registered as Democrats versus as Republicans. However, certain areas in both North and South Orange County vary from these general trends.[19]\\r\\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Orange County had a population of 3,010,232. The racial makeup of Orange County was 1,830,758 (60.8%) White (44.0% non-Hispanic white), 50,744 (1.7%) African American, 18,132 (0.6%) Native American, 537,804 (17.9%) Asian, 9,354 (0.3%) Pacific Islander, 435,641 (14.5%) from other races, and 127,799 (4.2%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1,012,973 persons (33.7%).[31]\\r\\nThe Hispanic and Latino population is predominantly of Mexican origin; this group accounts for 28.5% of the county's population, followed by Salvadorans (0.8%), Guatemalans (0.5%), Puerto Ricans (0.4%), Cubans (0.3%), Colombians (0.3%), and Peruvians (0.3%).[32] Santa Ana with its population reportedly 75 percent Hispanic/Latino, is among the most Hispanic/Latino percentage cities in both California and the U.S., esp. of Mexican-American descent.[33] See also Logan Park (Santa Ana), the city's largest and oldest barrio.\\r\\nAmong the Asian population, 6.1% are Vietnamese, followed by Koreans (2.9%), Chinese (2.7%), Filipinos (2.4%), Indians (1.4%), Japanese (1.1%), Cambodians (0.2%) Pakistanis (0.2%), Thais (0.1%), Indonesians (0.1%), and Laotians (0.1%).[32] According to KPCC in 2014, Orange County has the largest proportion of Asian Americans in Southern California, where one in five residents are Asian American.[34] There is also a significant Muslim population in the county.[35]\\r\\nAs of the census[36] of 2000, there were 2,846,289 people, 935,287 households, and 667,794 families residing in the county, making Orange County the second most populous county in California. The population density was 1,392/km2 (3,606/sq?mi). There were 969,484 housing units at an average density of 474/km2 (1,228/sq?mi). The racial makeup of the county was 64.8% White, 13.6% Asian, 1.7% African American, 0.7% Native American, 0.3% Pacific Islander, 14.8% from other races, and 4.1% from two or more races. 30.8% are Hispanic or Latino of any race. 8.9% were of German, 6.9% English and 6.0% Irish ancestry according to Census 2000. 58.6% spoke only English at home; 25.3% spoke Spanish, 4.7% Vietnamese, 1.9% Korean, 1.5% Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin) and 1.2% Tagalog.\\r\\nIn 1990, still according to the census[37] there were 2,410,556 people residing in the county. The racial makeup of the county was 78.6% White, 10.3% Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.8% African American, 0.5% Native American, and 8.8% from other races. 23.4% were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\\r\\nOut of 935,287 households, 37.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.9% married couples were living together, 10.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.6% were non-families. 21.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.00 and the average family size was 3.48.\\r\\nEthnic change has been transforming the population. By 2009, nearly 45 percent of the residents spoke a language other than English at home. Whites now comprise only 45 percent of the population, while the numbers of Hispanics grow steadily, along with Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese families. The percentage of foreign-born residents jumped to 30 percent in 2008 from 6 percent in 1970. The mayor of Irvine, Sukhee Kang, was born in Korea, making him the first Korean-American to run a major American city. We have 35 languages spoken in our city, Kang observed.[38] The population is diverse age-wise, with 27.0% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 33.2% from 25 to 44, 20.6% from 45 to 64, and 9.9% 65 years of age or older. The median age is 33 years. For every 100 females there were 99.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.7 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the county was $61,899, and the median income for a family was $75,700 (these figures had risen to $71,601 and $81,260 respectively as of a 2007 estimate[39]). Males had a median income of $45,059 versus $34,026 for females. The per capita income for the county was $25,826. About 7.0% of families and 10.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.2% of those under age 18 and 6.2% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nResidents of Orange County are known as \\"Orange Countians\\".[40]\\r\\nOrange County is the base for several religious organizations:\\r\\nBoth Armenian churches were presented with a resolution declaring every April 24 Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day by the Orange County Board of Supervisors, passed unanimously on May 10, 2016.\\r\\nOrange County is a charter county of California; its seat is Santa Ana.\\r\\nThe elected offices of the county government consist of the five-member Board of Supervisors, Assessor, Auditor-Controller, Clerk-Recorder, District Attorney-Public Administrator, Sheriff-Coroner, and Treasurer-Tax Collector. Except for the Board of Supervisors, each of these elected officers are elected by the voters of the entire county and oversee their own County departments.[42]\\r\\nAs of February 2017[update], the six countywide elected officers are:[42][43]\\r\\nA seventh countywide elected officer, the County Superintendent of Schools does not oversee a county department, instead (jointly with an independently-elected County Board of Education) overseeing the wholly independent, anachronistically-named Orange County Department of Education.[44]\\r\\nEach of the five members of the Board of Supervisors is elected from a regional district, and together, the board oversees the activities of the county's agencies and departments and sets policy on development, public improvements, and county services. At the beginning of each calendar year, the Supervisors select a Chair and Vice Chair amongst themselves. The Chair presides over board meetings, and the Vice Chair presides when the Chair is not present. The Board appoints the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors, the County Counsel, the Performance Audit Director, and the Director of the Office of Independent Review. The Board also appoints the County Executive Officer to act as the chief administrative officer of the county and the manager of all agencies and departments not under the sole jurisdiction of an elected county official nor the sole jurisdiction of one of the four aforementioned officers appointed by the Board.[45]\\r\\nAs of February 2017[update], the members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors are:[42][43][45]\\r\\nThe County Department of Education is wholly separate from the County government and is jointly overseen by the elected County Superintendent of Schools and the five-member Orange County Board of Education, whose trustees are popularly elected from five separate trustee areas.[44]\\r\\nAs of January 2017[update], the six elected officials overseeing the Orange County Department of Education are:[43][46]\\r\\nThe VA loan limit for Orange County is $625,500 as of 2016.[47][48]\\r\\nOn July 12, 2010, it was revealed that former Sheriff Mike Carona received over $215,000 in pension checks in 2009, despite his felony conviction.[49] A 2005 state law denied a public pension to public officials convicted of wrongdoing in office, however, that law only applied to benefits accrued after December 2005. Carona became eligible for his pension at age 50, and is also entitled, by law, to medical and dental benefits.[50][51] It was noted that the county's retirement system faces a massive shortfall totaling $3.7 billion unfunded liabilities, and Carona was one of approximately 400 retired Orange County public servants who received more than $100,000 in benefits in 2009.[52] Also on the list of those receiving extra-large pension checks is former treasurer-tax collector Robert Citron, whose investments, which were made while consulting psychics and astrologers, led Orange County into bankruptcy in 1994.[53]\\r\\nCitron, a Democrat, funneled billions of public dollars into questionable investments, and at first the returns were high and cities, schools and special districts borrowed millions to join in the investments. But the strategy backfired, and Citron's investment pool lost $1.64 billion. Nearly $200 million had to be slashed from the county budget and more than 1,000 jobs were cut. The county was forced to borrow $1 billion.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility filed a lawsuit against the pension system to get the list. The agency had claimed that pensioner privacy would be compromised by the release. A judge approved the release and the documents were released late June 2010. The release of the documents has reopened debate on the pension plan for retired public safety workers approved in 2001 when Carona was sheriff.[54]\\r\\nCalled \\"3 percent at 50,\\" it lets deputies retire at age 50 with 3 percent of their highest year's pay for every year of service. Before it was approved and applied retroactively, employees received 2 percent.[55] \\"It was right after Sept. 11,\\" said Orange County Supervisor John Moorlach. \\"All of a sudden, public safety people became elevated to god status. The Board of Supervisors were tripping over themselves to make the motion.\\" He called it \\"one of the biggest shifts of money from the private sector to the public sector.\\" Moorlach, who was not on the board when the plan was approved, led the fight to repeal the benefit. A lawsuit, which said the benefit should go before voters, was rejected in Los Angeles County Superior Court in 2009 and is now under appeal.[54] Carona opposed the lawsuit when it was filed, likening its filing to a \\"nuclear bomb\\" for deputies.[citation needed]\\r\\nOrange County has long been known as a Republican stronghold and has consistently sent Republican representatives to the state and federal legislatures. Republican majorities in Orange County helped deliver California's electoral votes to Republican presidential candidates Richard Nixon (1960, 1968 and 1972), Gerald Ford (1976), Ronald Reagan (1980 and 1984) and George H. W. Bush (1988). As a measure of how Republican Orange County has historically been, it was one of only five counties in the state that voted for Barry Goldwater in 1964.\\r\\nThe Republican margin began to narrow in the 1990s and 2000s as the state trended Democratic, and in 2016, Hillary Clinton won the county with a majority.[57] This was the first time Orange County had voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1936 landslide re-election for a second term.\\r\\nOnly six Democrats have carried the county in a statewide race in the last 50 years--Jerry Brown in his gubernatorial re-election campaign in 1978, March Fong Eu for Secretary of State, Kenneth Cory for State Controller in 1978, Kathleen Connell for Controller in 1998, Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential Election, Kamala Harris in 2016 for Senate (who was in a run-off race against another Democrat, Loretta Sanchez).\\r\\nThe 73rd Assembly Seat is largely considered the safest Republican state assembly seat and currently held by Bill Brough.[58][59] The highest ranking Republican elected official in California, Board of Equalization Vice Chair Diane Harkey, is also an Orange County resident.[60]\\r\\nAlthough Democrats have made inroads in the northern end of the county since the mid-1980s, Orange County politics are still dominated by Republicans. Four of the county's seven U.S. Representatives, three of its five State Senators, and five of its seven State Assembly members are Republicans. All five members of the County Board of Supervisors are Republicans as well, as are the seven countywide elected officials.\\r\\n? Special election\\r\\nIn the United States House of Representatives, Orange County is split between seven congressional districts:[61]\\r\\nIn the California State Senate, Orange County is split between 5 districts:[62]\\r\\nAccording to the Orange County Registrar of Voters, as of May 21, 2012, Orange County had 1,612,145 registered voters. Of these, 42.17% (679,877) are registered Republicans, and 31.41% (506,389) are registered Democrats. An additional 22.01% (354,820) declined to state a political party.\\r\\nOrange County has produced such notable Republicans as President Richard Nixon (born in Yorba Linda and lived in Fullerton and San Clemente), U.S. Senator John F. Seymour (previously Mayor of Anaheim), and U.S. Senator Thomas Kuchel (of Anaheim). Former Congressman Christopher Cox (of Newport Beach), a White House counsel for President Ronald Reagan, is also a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Orange County was also home to former Republican Congressman John G. Schmitz, a presidential candidate in 1972 from the ultra-conservative American Independent Party and the father of Mary Kay Letourneau. In 1996, Curt Pringle (later Mayor of Anaheim) became the first Republican-elected Speaker of the California State Assembly in decades.\\r\\nWhile the growth of the county's Hispanic and Asian populations in recent decades has significantly influenced the culture of Orange County, its conservative reputation has remained largely intact. Partisan voter registration patterns of Hispanics, Asians and other ethnic minorities in the county have tended to reflect the surrounding demographics, with resultant Republican majorities in all but the central portion of the county. When Loretta Sanchez, a Blue Dog Democrat, defeated veteran Republican Bob Dornan in the congressional contest of 1996, she was continuing a trend of Democratic representation of that district that had been interrupted by Dornan's 1984 upset of former Congressman Jerry Patterson. Until 1992, Sanchez herself was a moderate Republican, and she is viewed as being somewhat more moderate than other Democrats from Southern California.\\r\\nRepublicans have responded to the influx of non-white immigrants by making more explicit efforts to court the Hispanic and Asian vote. In 2004, George W. Bush captured 60% of the county's vote, up from 56% in 2000, despite a higher Democratic popular vote statewide compared with the 2000 election. Although Barbara Boxer won statewide, and fared better in Orange County than she did in 1998, Republican Bill Jones defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. While the 39% that John Kerry received is higher than the percentage Bill Clinton won in both 1992 and 1996, the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 (59.7% of the vote) is the highest any presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in the county. In 2006, Senator Dianne Feinstein won 45% of the vote in the county, the highest margin of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades, but Orange was nevertheless the only Coastal California county to vote for her Republican opponent Dick Mountjoy. In terms of voter registration, the Democratic Party has a plurality or majority of registrations only in the cities of Buena Park, Laguna Beach, Santa Ana and Stanton.[63]\\r\\nThe county is featured prominently in the book Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right by Lisa McGirr. She argues that the county's conservative political orientation in the 20th century owed much to its settlement by farmers from the Great Plains, who reacted strongly to communist sympathies, the civil rights movement, and the turmoil of the 1960s in nearby Los Angeles  across the \\"Orange Curtain\\".\\r\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Orange County was one of California's leading Republican voting blocs and a sub-culture of residents to hold \\"Middle American\\" values that emphasized a capitalist religious morality [clarification needed] in contrast to West coast liberalism that well existed there.\\r\\nOrange County has many Republican voters from culturally conservative Asian-American, Middle Eastern and Latino immigrant groups. The large Vietnamese-American communities in Garden Grove and Westminster are predominantly Republican; Vietnamese Americans registered Republicans outnumber those registered as Democrats by 55% to 22%. Republican Assemblyman Van Tran was elected to become the first Vietnamese-American to serve in a state legislature and joined with Texan Hubert Vo as the highest-ranking elected Vietnamese-American in the United States prior to the 2008 election of Joseph Cao in Louisiana's 2nd congressional district. In the 2007 special election for the vacant county supervisor seat following Democrat Lou Correa's election to the state senate, two Vietnamese-American Republican candidates topped the list of 10 candidates, separated from each other by only seven votes, making the Orange County Board of Supervisors entirely Republican; Correa is the sole Democrat to have served on the Board since 1987 and only the fifth since 1963.\\r\\nThe following table includes the number of incidents reported and the rate per 1,000 persons for each type of offense.\\r\\nOrange County is the headquarters of many Fortune 500 companies including Ingram Micro (#69) and First American Corporation (#312) in Santa Ana, Broadcom (#343) in Irvine, Western Digital (#439) in Lake Forest and Pacific Life (#452) in Newport Beach.

The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) cited OCTA as the best large public transportation system in the United States for 2005. OCTA manages the county's bus network and funds the construction and maintenance of local streets, highways, and freeways; regulates taxicab services; maintains express toll lanes through the median of California State Route 91; and works with Southern California's Metrolink to provide commuter rail service along three linesthe Orange County Line, the 91 Line, and the Inland Empire-Orange County Line.\\r\\nGround transportation in Orange County relies heavily on three major interstate highways: the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5), the San Diego Freeway (I-405 and I-5 south of Irvine), and the San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605), which only briefly enters Orange County territory in the northwest. The other freeways in the county are state highways, and include the perpetually congested Riverside and Artesia Freeway (SR 91) and the Garden Grove Freeway (SR 22) running east-west, and the Orange Freeway (SR 57), the Costa Mesa Freeway (SR/SR 55), the Laguna Freeway (SR 133), the San Joaquin Transportation Corridor (SR 73), the Eastern Transportation Corridor (SR 261, SR 133, SR 241), and the Foothill Transportation Corridor (SR 241) running north-south. Minor stub freeways include the Richard M. Nixon Freeway (SR 90), also known as Imperial Highway, and the southern terminus of Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1). There are no U.S. Highways in Orange County, though two existed in the county until the mid-1960s: 91 and 101. 91 went through what is now the state route of the same number, and 101 was replaced by Interstate 5. SR-1 was once a bypass of US-101 (Route 101A).\\r\\nThe bus network comprises 6,542 stops on 77 lines, running along most major streets, and accounts for 210,000 boardings a day. The fleet of 817 buses is gradually being replaced by CNG (Compressed natural gas)-powered vehicles, which already represent over 40% of the total fleet. Service is operated by OCTA employees and First Transit under contract. OCTA operates one bus rapid transit service, Bravo, on Harbor Boulevard. In addition, OCTA offers paratransit service for the disabled, also operated by MV.\\r\\nStarting in 1992, Metrolink has operated three commuter rail lines through Orange County, and has also maintained Rail-to-Rail service with parallel Amtrak service. On a typical weekday, over 40 trains run along the Orange County Line, the 91 Line and the Inland Empire-Orange County Line. Along with Metrolink riders on parallel Amtrak lines, these lines generate approximately 15,000 boardings per weekday. Metrolink also began offering weekend service on the Orange County Line and the Inland Empire-Orange County line in the summer of 2006. As ridership has steadily increased in the region, new stations have opened at Anaheim Canyon, Buena Park, Tustin, and Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo. Plans for a future station in Placentia are underway and is expected to be completed by 2014.\\r\\nSince 1938, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad and later Amtrak, has operated the Pacific Surfliner regional passenger train route (previously named the San Diegan until 2000)[70] through Orange County. The route includes stops at eight stations in Orange County including San Clemente Pier (selected trips), San Juan Capistrano, Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo (selected trips), Irvine, Santa Ana, Orange (selected trips), Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center (ARTIC), and Fullerton Transportation Center.\\r\\nA streetcar line in Anaheim is undergoing environmental impact assessment. This line will connect the Disneyland Resort, Convention Center, and Angel Stadium to the ARTIC transportation hub, in the city of Anaheim.[71][72][73][74] The Santa Ana/Garden Grove Fixed Guideway Project plans a streetcar line connecting Downtown Santa Ana to the Depot at Santa Ana has completed the environmental document and is entering the design phase.[75] OCTA has also proposed connecting the two systems via Harbor Boulevard and the West Santa Ana Branch corridor.[76][77]\\r\\nA car and passenger ferry service, the Balboa Island Ferry, comprising three ferries running every five minutes, operates within Newport Harbor between Balboa Peninsula and Balboa Island in Newport Beach. The Catalina Flyer connects the Balboa Peninsula to Avalon with daily round-trip passage through about nine months of the year. The Catalina Express connects Dana Point to Avalon (with departures from two greater Long Beach ports also connecting to Two Harbors).\\r\\nOrange County's only major airport is John Wayne Airport. Although its abbreviation (SNA) refers to Santa Ana, the airport is in fact located in unincorporated territory surrounded by the cities of Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, and Irvine. Unincorporated Orange County (including the John Wayne Airport) has mailing addresses, which go through the Santa Ana Post Office. For this reason, SNA was chosen as the IATA Code for the airport.[citation needed] The actual Destination Moniker which appears on most Arrival/Departure Monitors in airports throughout the United States is \\"Orange County\\", which is the common nickname used for the OMB Metropolitan Designation: Santa Ana-Anaheim-Irvine, California. Its modern Thomas F. Riley Terminal handles over 9 million passengers annually through 14 different airlines.\\r\\nThe area's warm Mediterranean climate and 42 miles (68?km) of year-round beaches attract millions of tourists annually. Huntington Beach is a hot spot for sunbathing and surfing; nicknamed \\"Surf City, U.S.A.\\", it is home to many surfing competitions. \\"The Wedge\\", at the tip of The Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach, is one of the most famous body surfing spots in the world. Southern California surf culture is prominent in Orange County's beach cities.\\r\\nOther tourist destinations include the theme parks Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim and Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park. Since the 2011 closure of Wild Rivers in Irvine, the county is home to just one water park: Soak City in Buena Park. The Anaheim Convention Center is the largest such facility on the West Coast. The old town area in the City of Orange (the traffic circle at the middle of Chapman Ave. at Glassell) still maintains its 1950s image, and appeared in the That Thing You Do! movie.\\r\\nLittle Saigon is another tourist destination, being home to the largest concentration of Vietnamese people outside of Vietnam. There are also sizable Taiwanese, Chinese, and Korean communities, particularly in western Orange County. This is evident in several Asian-influenced shopping centers in Asian American hubs like the city of Irvine.\\r\\nHistorical points of interest include Mission San Juan Capistrano, the renowned destination of migrating swallows. The Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum is in Yorba Linda and the Richard Nixon Birthplace home, located on the grounds of the Library, is a National Historic Landmark.

The team won the World Series under manager Mike Scioscia in 2002. In 2005, new owner Arte Moreno wanted to change the name to \\"Los Angeles Angels\\" in order to better tap into the Los Angeles media market, the second largest in the country. However, the standing agreement with the city of Anaheim demanded that they have \\"Anaheim\\" in the name, so they became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. This name change was hotly disputed by the city of Anaheim, but the change stood and still stands today, which prompted a lawsuit by the city of Anaheim against Angels owner Arte Moreno, won by Moreno. It has been widely unpopular in Orange County.[82]\\r\\nThe county's National Hockey League team, the Anaheim Ducks, won the 2007 Stanley Cup beating the Ottawa Senators. They also came close to winning the 2003 Stanley Cup finals after losing in Game 7 against the New Jersey Devils.\\r\\nThe Toshiba Classic, the only PGA Champions Tour event in the area, is held each March at The Newport Beach Country Club.

The Los Angeles Clippers played some home games at The Arrowhead Pond, now known as the Honda Center, from 1994 to 1999, before moving to Staples Center, which they share with the Los Angeles Lakers.\\r\\nThese communities are outside of city limits in unincorporated county territory.\\r\\nOrange County has a history of large planned communities. Nearly 30 percent of the county was created as master planned communities[citation needed], the most notable being the City of Irvine, Coto de Caza, Anaheim Hills, Tustin Ranch, Tustin Legacy, Ladera Ranch, Talega, Rancho Santa Margarita, and Mission Viejo. Irvine is often referred to as a model master-planned city because its villages of Woodbridge, Northwood, University Park, and Turtle Rock that were laid out by the Irvine Company of the mid-1960s before it was bought by a group of investors that included Donald Bren.\\r\\nThe population ranking of the following table is based on the 2010 census of Orange County.[83]\\r\\n? county seat\\r\\nDue to Orange County's proximity to Los Angeles, many film and media celebrities have moved or bought second homes in the county.

Its form factor is credited to Apple's Chief Design Officer, Jonathan Ive.[3][9]\\r\\nIn April 2003, at the \\"All Things Digital\\" executive conference, Jobs expressed his belief that tablet PCs and traditional PDAs were not good choices as high-demand markets for Apple to enter, despite receiving many requests for Apple to create another PDA. He believed that cell phones were going to become important devices for portable information access, and that mobile phones needed to have excellent synchronization software. At that time, instead of focusing on a follow-up to their Newton PDA, Jobs had Apple focus on the iPod. Jobs also had Apple develop the iTunes software, which can be used to synchronize content with iPod devices. iTunes was released in January 2001.[10][11][12][13] On September 7, 2005, Apple and Motorola released the ROKR E1, the first mobile phone to use iTunes. Jobs was unhappy with the ROKR, feeling that having to compromise with a non-Apple designer (Motorola) prevented Apple from designing the phone they wanted to make.[14] In September 2006, Apple discontinued support for the ROKR, and released a version of iTunes that included references to an as-yet unknown mobile phone that could display pictures and video.[15] Ed Zander (the CEO of Motorola at the time) \\"inspired\\"[clarify] Steve Jobs with Moto's[clarify] multimedia (e.g., iTunes) + smartphone product concept.[clarify] As a result, Apple gained a new product concept, called \\"iPhone\\", while Motorola walked away[clarify] with a limited version of iTunes for Rokr/Slvr.\\r\\nOn January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs announced iPhone at the Macworld convention, receiving substantial media attention.[16] Jobs announced that the first iPhone would be released later that year. On June 29, 2007, the first iPhone[17] was released.\\r\\nOn June 11, 2007, Apple announced at the Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference that the iPhone would support third-party applications using the Safari engine. Third parties would be able to create Web 2.0 applications, which users could access via the internet.[18] Such applications appeared even before the release of the iPhone; the first of these, called OneTrip, was a program meant to keep track of users' shopping lists.[19] On June 29, 2007, Apple released version 7.3 of iTunes to coincide with the release of iPhone.[20] This release contains support for iPhone service activation and syncing.\\r\\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the iPhone is manufactured on contract[clarify] in the Shenzhen factory of the Taiwanese company Hon Hai (also known as Foxconn).[21] Also, according to recent news, Apple will shortly begin outsourcing the manufacturing of iPhones.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Apple released the iPhone on January 9, 2007,[23] it was sold only with AT&T (formerly Cingular) contracts in the United States.[14] After 18 months of negotiations, Steve Jobs reached an agreement with the wireless division of AT&T to be the iPhone's exclusive carrier. Consumers were unable to use any other carrier without unlocking their device.\\r\\nApple retained control of the design, manufacturing and marketing of the iPhone.[24] Since some customers were jailbreaking their iPhones to leave their network, AT&T began charging them a $175 early-termination fee for leaving before the end of their contract.[25]\\r\\nQuestions arose about the legality of Apple's arrangement after the iPhone was released.[26] Two class-action lawsuits were filed against the company in October 2007: one in Federal court and the other in state court.[27] According to the suits, Apple's exclusive agreement with AT&T violated antitrust law.[28]\\r\\nThe state-court suit, filed by the law office of Damian R. Fernandez on behalf of California resident Timothy P. Smith,[28] sought an injunction barring Apple from selling iPhones with a software lock and $200 million in damages.[29] In Smith v. Apple Inc., the plaintiffs said that Apple failed to disclose to purchasers its five-year agreement with AT&T when they bought iPhones with a two-year contract and cited the Sherman Act's prohibition of monopolies.[30]\\r\\nThe second case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiff, Paul Holman, filed a complaint against Apple and AT&T Mobility that he could not switch carriers or change SIM cards without losing iPhone improvements to which he was entitled. Holman also cited a Sherman Act violation by the defendants.[31] On July?8, 2010, the case was affirmed for class certification.[32] On December 9 the court ordered a stay on the case, awaiting the Supreme Court's decision in AT&T v. Concepcion (disputed whether the state's basic standards of fairness were met by a clause in AT&T's contract limiting complaint resolution to arbitration).[33] On April 27, 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that AT&T met the state's fairness standards.[34]\\r\\nThe first advertisement for iPhone, titled \\"Hello\\", aired during the 79th Academy Awards on February 25, 2007, on American Broadcasting Company (ABC).[35] On June 4, 2007, Apple released four advertisements announcing that iPhone would be released on June 29, 2007.\\r\\nOn July 1, 2007, it was reported that Apple paid at least US$1 million to Michael Kovatch for the iPhone.com domain name, previously owned by Kovatch since 1995.[36] The URL now redirects to Apple's iPhone page.\\r\\nOn June 28, 2007, during an address to Apple employees, Steve Jobs announced that all full-time Apple employees and those part-time employees who had been with the company for at least one year would receive a free iPhone. Employees received their phones in July after the initial demand for iPhones subsided.[37]\\r\\nInitially priced at US $499 and US $599 for the 4GB models and 8GB models respectively, the iPhone went on sale on June 29, 2007. Apple closed its stores at 2:00pm local time to prepare for the 6:00pm iPhone launch, while hundreds of customers lined up at stores nationwide.[38]\\r\\nIn the US and some other countries, iPhones could only be acquired with a credit card, preventing completely anonymous purchases of iPhones.[39][40][41] At the time, there was no way to opt out of the bundled AT&T data plan. At first, iPhones could not be added to an AT&T Business account, and any existing business account discounts could not be applied to an iPhone AT&T account. AT&T changed these restrictions in late January 2008.[42]\\r\\nThe Associated Press also reported in 2007 that some users were unable to activate their phones because, according to AT&T, \\"[a] high volume of activation requests [was] taxing the company's computer servers.\\"[43][44] On Oct 29, 2007, the Usenet newsgroup misc.phone.mobile.iphone was created.[relevant? ÿ discuss]\\r\\nEarly estimates by technology analysts estimated sales of between 250,000 and 700,000 iPhones in the first weekend alone, with strong sales continuing after the initial weekend.[45][46] As part of their quarterly earnings announcement, AT&T reported that 146,000 iPhones were activated in the first weekend.

Brian Barrett, Managing Editor of the Gizmodo publication, speculated that either an upgraded version of iPhone 5 or a budget version would be released.[57]\\r\\nStories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press a little more than a month after iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release.[58] The 300-page iPhone bill in a box received by iJustine on Saturday, August 11, 2007[59][60] became the subject of a viral video, posted by the following Monday, which quickly became an Internet meme.[61][62] This video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media. Ten days later, after the video had been viewed more than 3 million times on the Internet,[63] and had received international news coverage, AT&T sent iPhone users a text message outlining changes in its billing practices.[64]\\r\\nOn September 5, 2007, the 4GB model was discontinued, and the 8GB model price was cut by a third, from US $599 to US $399.[65] Those who had purchased an iPhone in the 14-day period before the September 5, 2007 announcement were eligible for a US $200 \\"price protection\\" rebate from Apple or AT&T. However, it was widely reported that some who bought between the June 29, 2007 launch and the August 22, 2007 price protection kick-in date complained that this was a larger-than-normal price drop for such a relatively short period and accused Apple of unfair pricing.[66][67]\\r\\nIn response to customer complaints, on September 6, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs wrote in an open letter to iPhone customers that everyone who purchased an iPhone at the higher price \\"and who is not receiving a rebate or other consideration\\", would receive a US$100 credit to be redeemed towards the purchase of any product sold in Apple's retail or online stores.[68]\\r\\nWith the July 11, 2008 release of the iPhone 3G, Apple and AT&T changed the US pricing model from the previous generation. Following the de facto model for mobile phone service in the United States, AT&T would subsidize a sizable portion of the upfront cost for the iPhone 3G, followed by charging moderately higher monthly fees over a minimum two-year contract.[69]\\r\\nOn November 9, 2007, the iPhone was officially launched in Europe, in the United Kingdom and Germany.[clarify] In the UK, sales go through the UK O2 unit of Telef܇nica, while in Germany, it is offered through Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile division.[clarify] As in the case of the previous launch in the US, customers lined up as much as a day in advance to obtain the much-anticipated phone.[70]\\r\\nApple occasionally produced a limited number of 4GB iPhones for German and UK markets, but they never reached end customers and were used as in-store demo units. Later[when?] most of the units were disposed of.[71]\\r\\nThe initial operating model of locking iPhone owners to one selected carrier has been controversial in Europe. In Germany, Vodafone, an operator competing with the operator that Apple had locked German iPhone sales to (Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile division), brought a legal case[clarify] claiming that the arrangement was against German law. On November 20, 2007, an interim court order resulted in sales of locked iPhones in Germany being temporarily stopped. The iPhone launch in France a few weeks later through the operator Orange faced the same legal issues. Other countries that will pose[clarify] the same problems for the business model revolving around the sale of locked iPhones include Belgium, Italy, Finland, and Brazil.\\r\\nOn December 1, 2007, Tu?mobil, the Slovenian mobile operator,[clarify] started selling \\"unlocked\\" iPhones without an official contract with Apple. The offer caused confusion between Apple Europe, local media, and local Apple representatives.[72]\\r\\nOn May 6, 2008, Telecom Italia announced that it had signed a deal with Apple to sell iPhones in Italy by the end of 2008.[73] It was estimated that it would probably be the second generation iPhone with 3G-UMTS capability.\\r\\nOn May 27, 2008, TeliaSonera released a press release stating that it would start selling iPhones in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia during 2008.[74]\\r\\nOn June 4, 2008, Movistar announced that it had signed a deal with Apple to sell iPhones in Spain beginning on July 11, 2008.[75]\\r\\nOn August 22, 2008, Estonian mobile operator EMT started selling iPhones.[76]\\r\\nOn August 22, 2008, Vodafone Greece released iPhones in the Greek market.[77]\\r\\nOn September 26, 2008, Omnitel released iPhones in Lithuania.[78]\\r\\nOn November 7, 2008, T-Mobile released iPhones in Croatia.[79]\\r\\nOn September 29, 2010, Elisa released the iPhone 4 in Finland.[80]\\r\\nSingTel (in Singapore) and Globe Telecom (in the Philippines) were the first two carriers to launch the iPhone in Southeast Asia. Both carriers launched the iPhone 3G in August 2008.\\r\\nOn March 20, 2009, Telkomsel became the first telecommunications company in Indonesia to offer the iPhone 3G with customizable plans for all Telkomsel customers.[clarify][81] In the same month, Maxis of Malaysia and DiGi both launched the iPhone 3G.[where?]\\r\\nOn October 2011, StarHub launched the iPhone in Singapore. Smart Communications followed suit in December 2011 by launching the iPhone 4S in the Philippines. Smart Communications was the last telecommunications company to carry Apple's iPhone in Southeast Asia.[clarify][82]\\r\\nThe iPhone 3G was released in Australia on July 11, 2008.[83]\\r\\nThe very first iPhone 3G model released on July 11, 2008[clarify] was sold in Auckland, New Zealand to 22-year-old student Jonny Gladwell at 12:01 am NZST.[84] The iPhone 3G was only available to customers on the Vodafone network.[clarify][85] There was criticism from some New Zealand customers when Vodafone announced pricing for the iPhone 3G, as Vodafone was the only network to offer this generation of iPhone.[where?]\\r\\nThe first-generation iPhone was only available for sale in New Zealand through parallel import stores soon after it went on sale in the US. The original models available for sale in New Zealand were unlocked for use on the Vodafone network and could be used with any plan, including pre-paid plans.[86]\\r\\nSubsequent launches of iPhone models in New Zealand have typically been a few weeks after the worldwide release.\\r\\nOn November 8, 2011, Telecom announced that they would offer the iPhone 4S on their network, along with earlier models (the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4).[87]\\r\\nAfter months of high anticipation, the first iPhone to be released in Canada was the iPhone 3G. Rogers Wireless began offering 8 GB and 16 GB models on July 11, 2008. Facing a public backlash,[88] Rogers dropped the price of its service plan from CA$100 to CA$30 per month.[89]\\r\\nThe iPhone 3GS, with the new iOS 3.0 operating system, was released in Canada by Rogers Wireless on June 19, 2009. Users who signed up for a 3-year agreement with a data option[clarify] could choose between a 16 GB device for CA$199 and a 32 GB device for CA$299.[90]\\r\\nBell and Telus Mobility announced that they would release iPhone on November 4 and 5, 2009, respectively.[clarify][91]\\r\\nOn May 6, 2008, Vodafone announced that they had signed a deal with Apple to sell iPhone in Australia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Italy, India, Portugal, New Zealand, South Africa, and Turkey.[92]\\r\\nSubsequent announcements confirmed that Apple is moving away from exclusive one-carrier deals.[needs update?] Soon after Vodafone's announcement, TIM announced that it would also be selling iPhone in Italy, on May 12, 2008, Optus[93] confirmed that it would sell iPhone in Australia and SingTel confirmed that it would be selling iPhone in India through its Indian Joint Venture, Airtel.[clarify]\\r\\nOn June 4, 2008, SoftBank Mobile released a press release stating that it would start selling iPhone in Japan during 2008.[94]\\r\\nRussia's second largest mobile operator, Beeline, announced on August 28, 2008 that they signed a contract with Apple to sell iPhone on the Russian market by late 2008. The deal was rumoured to be non-exclusive, according to unofficial statements made by MTS and MegaFon. MTS and MegaFon belong to the \\"Russian Big Three\\",[relevant? ÿ discuss] and were expected to release the iPhone 3G at the same time as Beeline. As predicted, MegaFon issued a press release regarding the iPhone 3G release on September 2, 2008.[95]\\r\\nOn November 14, 2008, Vodafone Egypt and Mobinil started selling the iPhone 3G in Egypt. iPhone 3G is priced at EGS3,800 and EGS4,600 for the 8 GB and 16 GB models respectively. Customers must also sign up for one of 3 service plans[clarify] to use the phone.\\r\\nOn September 28, 2009, Orange announced that they were going to become the second operator of the iPhone in the UK, indicating that an exclusive deal that O2 had established with Apple in 2007 had ended. Orange later announced that the iPhone would be released on November 10, with pricing plans starting from S29.36 on contract and S440 for the 3GS 16GB on pay as you go.[clarify][96][97] On the following day, Vodafone UK announced that they would be selling the iPhone by early 2010, becoming the third UK network and Vodafone's 11th country to offer the iPhone.[98]\\r\\nThere had been ongoing speculation in the United States that Apple might offer a CDMA-compatible iPhone for Verizon Wireless.[99] This speculation increased on October 6, 2010, when The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would begin producing a CDMA-compatible iPhone, with such a model going on sale in early 2011.[100]\\r\\nOn January 8, 2011, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that Verizon Wireless would, on January 11, 2011, officially announce the launch of a CDMA-based iPhone for use on their network.[101] The date in which the Verizon iPhone would go on sale was unknown, though the two most recent[needs update?] iPhone releases were made available within weeks of their launch announcement. Verizon confirmed the announcement on January 11, with an on-sale date of February 10.[102]\\r\\nOn January 11, 2011, Verizon announced that they would start carrying a CDMA version of Apple's iPhone 4 during February 2011. Existing Verizon Wireless customers could pre-order iPhone on February 3. Pricing for the iPhone 4 was $199 for 16GB and $299 for 32GB.[103] The Verizon iPhone 5 released on Friday, September 19, in the United States; it was the first GSM unlocked iPhone,[104] which worked on AT&T and other GSM networks.[clarify]\\r\\nThe international release of iPhone has been staggered over several months. Today, the iPhone is available in most countries.[105]\\r\\n? iPhone offered by multiple carriers under contract from Apple (country not carrier-exclusive)\\r\\n? iPhone offered without contract and without carrier lock\\r\\n MVNO with O2\\r\\nEach iPhone normally prevents access to its media player and web features unless it has been activated as a phone through AT&T or O2. On July 3, 2007, Jon Lech Johansen reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked iPhone's other features with jailbreaking. He published the software and offsets for others to use.[117]\\r\\nOn August 14, 2007, Gizmodo reported verification of a method to bypass iPhone's SIM lock, allowing the phone to work freely with carriers other than AT&T. This method requires usage of a Turbo SIM card, costing approximately US$80; the method essentially tricks iPhone into believing that it is operating on the AT&T network, even when it is connected natively (not in roaming mode) to another carrier.[118] Australian Personal Computer later published a ten-step guide to unlocking iPhone, using the Turbo SIM method.[119]\\r\\nIn mid-August, UniquePhones announced an unlocking service for iPhone, only to retract the service the following week after receiving a phone call from a lawyer representing AT&T.\\r\\nOn August 24, 2007, George Hotz, a 17-year-old hacker from Glen Rock, New Jersey, broke the lock that ties Apple's iPhone to AT&T's wireless network. He confirmed that he unlocked the phone and was using it on T-Mobile's network. The hack opened up a realm of possibilities for overseas customers because iPhone was only sold in the US at the time. By unlocking it, Hotz opened up the phone to all kinds of phone networks across the world. Hotz posted the hack on his blog. The process is complicated and requires both disassembling iPhone and executing software commands on a personal computer. Hotz, along with four others across the world, reportedly spent about 500 hours unlocking the phone.[120][121]\\r\\nAlso on August 24, 2007, Engadget reported, by way of photos and a video clip, that they were called by the \\"iPhoneSimFree\\" team, who offered to show Engadget a demonstration of unlocking iPhone using a software-only method.[122] Unlike Hotz's hardware hack, the code in this hack was not made available to the general public. Sales of the unlock started on September 10. These sales occurred through several resellers who were able to order \\"keys\\" from iPhoneSimFree, then pass the \\"keys\\" to customers, allowing the customers to use the software.\\r\\nOn September 11, after one day of sales, the iPhone Dev Team announced that they had created a working \\"software unlock\\", and released it to the public for free.[123] Utilizing the existing unlock[clarify] requires some technical knowledge, although a simpler, GUI-based version was under construction. Two free, GUI-based unlocking programs that have been made available are AnySim and iUnlock Reloaded.\\r\\nOn September 24, 2007 Apple issued a warning that future updates could render unlocked iPhones unusable.[124] On September 27, 2007, owners of unlocked iPhones who took advantage of the version 1.1.1 update through iTunes reported that the update rendered the device virtually inoperable.[125] There were also reports that the update even affected some iPhones that were not unlocked,[126] and Engadget found that the firmware update had \\"bricked\\" unhacked iPhones as well. The firmware update relocks iPhones, but on October 11 iPhoneSIMFree announced that they had hacked the 1.1.1 iPhone update, not only unlocking them but also unbricking those iPhones which were bricked by the update.[127]\\r\\nOn October 16, 2007, the iPhone Dev Team released AnySIM 1.1, the free utility that unlocks iPhones. The updated version works on firmware version 1.1.1, but doesn't fix baseband problems caused by updating an unlocked 1.0.2 phone up to 1.1.1.[128]\\r\\nOn October 23, 2007, the iPhone Elite Dev-Team released Revirginizing Tool to rebuild the lock table in the seczone area to repair the damage done by the original anySIM 1.0x unlockers so unlocked 1.0.2 iPhones can upgrade to 1.1.1 without bricking iPhone. The tool is unbricking the previously bricked iPhones.[129]\\r\\nOn November 21, 2007, T-Mobile announced that due to litigation commenced against them by their competitor Vodafone, which resulted in a preliminary injunction preventing T-Mobile from locking the SIM card to T-Mobile in Germany, it will sell the phone \\"unlocked\\" and will offer iPhone without a T-Mobile contract for ?999 (US$1,478) at its shops to customers in Germany until the court renders a decision.[130]\\r\\nBy the end of November, Apple released another version of iPhone firmware, 1.1.2.

The Naval Academy completed its final season as an FBS independent school (not in a conference) in 2014, and became a single-sport member of the American Athletic Conference beginning in the 2015 season.[2] The team has been coached by Ken Niumatalolo since December 2007. Navy has 19 players and three coaches in the College Football Hall of Fame and won the college football national championship in 1926 according to the Boand and Houlgate poll systems. The 1910 team also was undefeated and unscored upon (the lone tie was a 0ÿ0 game).[3] The mascot is Bill the Goat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Naval Academy's football program is one of the nation's oldest, with its history dating back to 1879.[4] There were two separate efforts to establish a Naval Academy football team in 1879. The first was guided by first-classman J.H. Robinson, who developed it as a training regiment to help keep the school's baseball team in shape. The team played the sport under rules that made it much closer to soccer, where the players were permitted only to kick the ball in order to advance it.[5] The second effort, headed by first-classman William John Maxwell was more successful in its efforts. Maxwell met with two of his friends, Tunstall Smith and Henry Woods, who played for the Baltimore Athletic Club and officially challenged their team to a game with the Naval Academy.[6] A team was formed from academy first-classmen, which Maxwell led as a manager, trainer, and captain. The team would wake up and practice before reveille and following drill and meals. The squad received encouragement from some of the faculty, who allowed them to eat a late dinner and skip final drill for additional practicing. This was against the direct orders of the school superintendent, who had banned football and similar activities.[6][7]\\r\\nThe year's sole contest was played on December 11 against the Baltimore Athletic Club. The opposition's team was reportedly composed of players from Princeton, Yale, Pennsylvania, and Johns Hopkins.[6][8] The Naval Academy hosted the Baltimore team on a temporary field drawn on part of the superintendent's cow pasture. Rules decided upon between the teams established that the game was to be played under rugby rules.[6][8] The Baltimore American and Chronicle, which covered the contest, described it as such:[9]\\r\\nThe game, played under rugby rules, was a battle from beginning to enda regular knock down and drag out fight. Both sides became immediately excited and the audience was aroused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm by the spirited contest. The ball oscillated backward and forward over the ground without any material result.[9]\\r\\nThe scrimmages were something awful to witnessliving, kicking, scrambling masses of humanity surging to and fro, each individual after the leather oval. If a Baltimorean got the ball and started for a run, he was unfailingly caught by one of the brawny Cadets and dashed to earth with five or six men falling on him.[9]\\r\\nThe game was closely fought and was finally declared a scoreless tie by the referee about an hour after it began. Navy reportedly never gained possession of the ball. However, the Naval Academy managed to keep the Baltimore Athletic Club from ever being in a scoring position. On three separate occasions, Navy forced Baltimore back into its own end zone for a safety; these were not worth any points until 1882, however, so they offered Navy no benefit. The American and Chronicle reported that Maxwell, Craven, and Sample of Navy gave the strongest performances, but were also reckless in their play and were repeatedly penalized for jumping offside or kicking the ball out of play, a form of delay of game.[10][11]\\r\\nSome time after the game, Walter Camp, known as the \\"Father of American Football\\", credited Maxwell as the inventor of the first football uniform. After he was informed that the Baltimore team he was playing outweighed his by an average of ten pounds, Maxwell looked for a way to make the teams more evenly matched. Using his knowledge of sailing, he decided to design a sleeveless canvas jacket which would make his players \\"difficult to grasp when they began to sweat\\".[9][12] He presented the design to the academy's tailor, who created the double-lined jackets which \\"were laced down the front and drawn tightly to fit snugly around a player's body\\".[9][12] The weighted suits were worn by the team, which was confused by the \\"strangle, heavy, newfangled getups\\".[12]\\r\\nThe Naval Academy would not produce another football team until the 1882 season. The 1882 team would be the first with a coach, being supported by Academy officials. The 1879 season was the last time that a Navy squad would play the Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14ÿ12ÿ2, with one of those ties being the game against the Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy would outscore their opponents 292ÿ231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54ÿ19ÿ3. The lack of a coach for the 1879 season was one of the two times the Naval Academy squad lacked one, the other time being from 1883 through 1891.[13][14]\\r\\nFrank Berrien served as Navy's head football coach from 1908-1910, compiling a record of 21ÿ5ÿ3.[15] He was the thirteenth head coach of the Naval Academy's football program and, under his tutelage, the Midshipmen compiled an undefeated 8ÿ0ÿ1 mark in 1910.[16]\\r\\nThree undefeated teams with nearly identical records would cause a stir among fans and pollsters today, but this was the case when Navy earned its lone national championship in 1926, as the Midshipmen shared the honor with Stanford and Alabama. A 7-7 tie between Alabama and Stanford in the 1926 Rose Bowl gave Stanford a 10-0-1 mark, while the Crimson Tide and the Mids each had identical 9-0-1 records.\\r\\nThe Midshipmen opened the '26 season with a new coach, Bill Ingram. A Navy football standout from 1916 through 1918, Ingram took over a Navy team that had only won seven games in the previous two seasons combined. One of the keys to Navys 1926 squad was a potent offense led by All-America tackle and team captain Frank Wickhorst, who proved to be a punishing blocker for the Navy offense. One member of the Navy offense that appreciated the blocking of Wickhorst was Tom Hamilton. The quarterback and kicker had a pair of 100-yard rushing games en route to All-America honors.\\r\\nNavy's biggest win that year was against Michigan in front of 80,000 fans in Baltimore. The Mids scored 10 second half points to upset the Wolverines, 10-0. Navys offense tallied 165 yards behind the powering attack of Hamilton and Henry Caldwell who scored Navys lone touchdown on a one-yard plunge. Jubilation from the victory continued after the game, as the Midshipmen tore down the goal post at each end of the field and carried away all the markers that lined both sides of the field.\\r\\nNavy headed into its season finale against Army with a 9-0 record. The game was to be played in Chicago at Soldier Field, which had been built as a memorial to the men killed in World War I. It was only natural Army and Navy would be invited to play the inaugural contest there. James R. Harrison of the New York Times described the game as \\"the greatest of its time and as a national spectacle.\\" Over 110,000 people witnessed the Midshipmen open up a 14-0 lead on the Cadets, only to see Army fight back to take a 21-14 lead early in the third quarter. The Navy offense responded behind its strong ground game led by running back Alan Shapley. On fourth down and three yards to go, Shapley ran eight yards for a touchdown to tie the game at 21. As the final quarter concluded, Army mounted a brief threat only to miss a 25-yard field goal.\\r\\nThe tie gave the Midshipmen a share of the national championship based on retroactive rankings by both the William Boand and Deke Houlgate mathematical poll systems.[3]\\r\\nNavy was one of the very few programs to field a football team during World War II, with John Whelchel leading the Midshipmen from 1942-1943 and Oscar Hagberg serving as head coach from 1944-1945. During those years, three of the four Navy teams finished ranked in the top 10 of the final AP poll.[17][18][19]\\r\\nGeorge Sauer left his post as Kansas head coach and took over in Annapolis from 1948-1949.[20] The Midshipmen struggled under Sauer's tutelage, posting a 3ÿ13ÿ2 record which included a winless 1948 season.[21]\\r\\nEddie Erdelatz returned to Navy, where he'd previously served as an assistant coach from 1945ÿ1947, to take over a football program that had won just four games over the previous five seasons.[22]\\r\\nIn 1950, Erdelatz led an upset of arch-rival Army.[23] The Black Knights entered the game with an 8ÿ0 record which had not lost in 28 contests.[23] Army also had defeated Navy five times in the last six games.[23] Although Navy had only a 2ÿ6 record, an outstanding defensive effort resulted in a 14ÿ2 victory for the Midshipmen.[23]\\r\\nAfter two years at Navy, Erdelatz's record stood at 5ÿ12ÿ1, but he would never again have a losing season in his final seven seasons and would finish 5ÿ3ÿ1 in his games against Army. In 1954, the team finished 8ÿ2, losing close games to Pittsburgh and Notre Dame.[24] Erdelatz labeled this squad, \\"A Team Called Desire\\" and then went on to shut out Ole in the 1955 Sugar Bowl.[25] Three years later, the Midshipmen competed in the Cotton Bowl Classic, where they knocked off Rice University, 20ÿ7.[26] The latter win came one year after Navy's bid to play in a bowl game was rejected despite having only one loss.\\r\\nAfter the bowl victory over Rice, Erdelatz was courted by other schools and nearly accepted the task of replacing Bear Bryant at Texas A&M University.[27] After the 1958 season, he was also seen as a candidate for the NFL's San Francisco 49ers head coaching job, but began spring practice the following year at Navy.[28] On April 8, 1959, Erdelatz resigned as head coach of the Midshipmen, citing a number of factors, including the desire for an easier schedule.[29]\\r\\nFrom 1959 to 1964, Wayne Hardin was the head coach at Navy, where he compiled a 38ÿ22ÿ2 record.[30] His Navy teams posted five consecutive wins against archrival Army, a feat not surpassed until 2007 when Paul Johnson's Navy squad won their sixth consecutive contest in the ArmyÿNavy Game.[31] Hardin coached Navy's two winners of the Heisman Trophy, Joe Bellino, who received the award in 1960,[32] and Roger Staubach, who did so in 1963.[33]\\r\\nHardin resigned as Navy's head coach following a 3ÿ6ÿ1 record in 1964.[34]\\r\\nVirginia head coach Bill Elias replaced Hardin, and the Midshipmen struggled mightilty under Elias' leadership. Elias' Midshipmen posted a 15ÿ22ÿ3 record in his four seasons,[35] which included three non-winning seasons. Elias was fired following a 2ÿ8 season in 1968.[36]\\r\\nFormer UConn head coach Rick Forzano was hired as Elias' replacement in 1969.[37][38] However, the Midshipmen's struggles continued, with Navy failing to post a single winning season, something that hadn't occurred in Annapolis in decades. Forzano's teams posted yearly records of 1ÿ9,[39] 2ÿ9,[40] 3ÿ8[41] and 4ÿ7.[42] Forzano resigned after the 1972 season.[43]\\r\\nPenn State assistant coach and Navy alum George Welsh succeeded Forzano as Navy's head coach.[44] He inherited a Navy Midshipmen football program that had only had one winning season since the days of Roger Staubach. He led the Midshipmen to three bowl game appearances and their first nine-win season in 16 years.[45][46] In nine seasons, Welsh compiled a record of 55ÿ46ÿ1,[45] making him the service academy's most successful coach.[47]\\r\\nIn 1982, Welsh left Navy to become the head coach at Virginia.[48]\\r\\nWest Virginia offensive coordinator Gary Tranquill was hired as Welsh's replacement in 1982.[49] Tranquill's Midshipmen compiled a 6ÿ5 record in 1982,[50] but it was downhill from there. 1983 saw a 3ÿ8 record[51] followed by back-to-back four-win seasons in 1984 and 1985.[52][53] A 3ÿ8 campaign in 1986 ended Tranquill's tenure at Navy as the school declined to renew his contract.[54]\\r\\nOne notable assistant coach during this time was Nick Saban, the legendary head coach at Alabama[55][better?source?needed].\\r\\nFormer Western Michigan head coach Elliot Uzelac was hired by Navy to serve as the school's 34th head football coach in 1987.[56] Navy's struggles continued, with the Midshipmen posting records of 2ÿ9 in 1987[57] followed by back-to-back 3ÿ8 seasons in 1988 and 1989.[58][59] Uzelac was fired following the 1989 season.[60]\\r\\nMarshall head coach George Chaump was hired as Uzelac's replacement in 1990.[61] Chaump was unable to revive the Midshipmen football program, compiling a record of 14ÿ41 in five seasons.[62] Chaump's Midshipmen posted back-to-back 1ÿ10 records in 1991 and 1992.[63][64] Navy fired Chaump after the 1994 season in which the Midshipmen finished 3ÿ8.[65][66]\\r\\nUtah State head coach Charlie Weatherbie was hired to replace Chaump in 1995.[67] Under Weatherbie, Navy did have a couple of winning seasons, the first coming in 1996 with a record of 9ÿ3 with a win in the Aloha Bowl.[68][69] That was followed with a 7ÿ4 campaign the following year.[70] After that, however, Navy struggled, failing to post a record better than a 5ÿ7 record. After a 1ÿ10 season in 2000[71] followed by an 0ÿ7 start to the 2001 season,[72] Weatherbie was fired.[73]\\r\\nIn 2002, Paul Johnson departed Georgia Southern and was hired as the 37th Navy head football coach.[74] Johnson's initial season saw the Midshipmen win only two of 12 games,[75] though the season ended on a high note with his first victory over Army,[76] which would not beat Navy again until 2016.[77] Subsequently, Johnson's teams enjoyed a high degree of success.\\r\\nThe 2003 team completed the regular season with an 8ÿ4 mark,[78] including wins over both Air Force and Army, and earned a berth in the Houston Bowl, Navy's first bowl game since 1996. However, the Midshipmen lost to Texas Tech, 38ÿ14.[79]\\r\\nIn 2004, Johnson's team posted the program's best record since 1957, finishing the regular season at 9ÿ2[80] and once again earning a bowl berth, this time in the Emerald Bowl. There Johnson coached the Midshipmen to a win over New Mexico, 34ÿ19, the fifth bowl win in the school's history.[81] The win gave Navy 10 wins on the season, tying a school record that had stood since 1905. For his efforts, Johnson received the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award.[82]\\r\\nThe 2005 Navy squad recorded a mark of 8ÿ4,[83] highlighted by victories over Army, Air Force, and Colorado State in the Poinsettia Bowl.\\r\\nIn 2007, Johnson coached the Midshipmen to their first win over rival Notre Dame since 1963, winning 46ÿ44 in triple-overtime.[84] Navy finished the season with an 8ÿ5 record.[85]\\r\\nJohnson dominated the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy competition, going 11ÿ1 (.917) in his six years, with the only loss against another service academy coming at the hands of Air Force in his first season. He was the first coach in Navy's history to go 6ÿ0 in his first six seasons against Army (Ken Niumatalolo, who followed Johnson at Navy, went 8-0 against Army in his first eight seasons), and his 2006 senior class was the first in Navy history to win the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy all four of their years.\\r\\nMuch of Johnson's success at Navy was predicated on his triple option flexbone offense, a run-oriented attack that led NCAA Division I-A/FBS football in rushing yards three of his last four years at Navy. Johnson departed Navy for the head coaching position at Georgia Tech after the end of the 2007 regular season.[86]\\r\\nKen Niumatalolo was promoted from offensive line coach to head football coach of the Naval Academy on December 8, 2007 after Johnson's departure for Georgia Tech.[87][88] Niumatalolo is the 38th head football coach in Naval Academy history. On January 7, 2009, Niumatalolo was given a contract extension, although terms and length of the extension were not released.[89]\\r\\nWith Niumatalolo as Navy's head coach, beginning with the 2008 season, the Mids have continued their run of success. Highlights in 2008 included an upset in Winston-Salem over #16 Wake Forest, 24ÿ17, the Mids' first victory over a ranked team in 23 years,[90] and a 34ÿ0 shutout victory of Army.[91]\\r\\nOther highlights of Niumatalolo's years as head coach at Navy include: Navy defeated Army in each of Niumatalolo's first nine seasons as head coach, not losing to Army until 2016. The 2016 loss ended a streak of 14 Midshipmen wins in the ArmyÿNavy Game,[92] the longest winning streak for either side in the rivalry. The Midshipmen captured the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy in 2008, 2009 and 2012. They went on to capture the trophy outright in 2013, with a 34ÿ7 win against Army, and recaptured it outright in 2015 with wins over Army and Air Force. The Midshipmen have nine winning seasons during Niumatalolo's 10 full years as head coach. The Mids have played in nine bowl games during Niumatalolo's tenure, winning the 2009 Texas Bowl,[93] 2013 Armed Forces Bowl,[94] 2014 Poinsettia Bowl, and 2015 Military Bowl. Navy defeated longtime rival Notre Dame in consecutive years, 2009 and 2010, for the first time since the early 1960s.[95][96] The Midshipmen also defeated Notre Dame in 2016, when the Midshipmen went on to finish with a 9ÿ5 record.[97][98]\\r\\nNiumatalolo led Navy into the American Athletic Conference after 134 years as an independent in 2015, the first time Navy joined a conference in the school's history.[99]\\r\\nThree undefeated teams with nearly identical records would cause a stir among fans and pollsters today, but this was the case when Navy earned its lone national championship in 1926, as the Midshipmen shared the honor with Stanford and Alabama. A 7ÿ7 tie between Alabama and Stanford in the 1926 Rose Bowl gave Stanford a 10ÿ0ÿ1 mark, while the Crimson Tide and the Mids each had identical 9ÿ0ÿ1 records.\\r\\nThe Midshipmen opened the '26 season with a new coach, Bill Ingram. A Navy football standout from 1916 through 1918, Ingram took over a Navy team that had only won seven games in the previous two seasons combined. One of the keys to Navys 1926 squad was a potent offense led by All-America tackle and team captain Frank Wickhorst, who proved to be a punishing blocker for the Navy offense. One member of the Navy offense that appreciated the blocking of Wickhorst was Tom Hamilton. The quarterback and kicker had a pair of 100-yard rushing games en route to All-America honors.\\r\\nNavy's biggest win that year was against Michigan in front of 80,000 fans in Baltimore. The Mids scored 10 second half points to upset the Wolverines, 10ÿ0. Navys offense tallied 165 yards behind the powering attack of Hamilton and Henry Caldwell who scored Navys lone touchdown on a one-yard plunge. Jubilation from the victory continued after the game, as the Midshipmen tore down the goal post at each end of the field and carried away all the markers that lined both sides of the field.\\r\\nNavy headed into its season finale against Army with a 9ÿ0 record. The game was to be played in Chicago at Soldier Field, which had been built as a memorial to the men killed in World War I. It was only natural Army and Navy would be invited to play the inaugural contest there. James R. Harrison of the New York Times described the game as \\"the greatest of its time and as a national spectacle.\\" Over 110,000 people witnessed the Midshipmen open up a 14ÿ0 lead on the Cadets, only to see Army fight back to take a 21ÿ14 lead early in the third quarter. The Navy offense responded behind its strong ground game led by running back Alan Shapley. On fourth down and three yards to go, Shapley ran eight yards for a touchdown to tie the game at 21. As the final quarter concluded, Army mounted a brief threat only to miss a 25-yard field goal.\\r\\nThe tie gave the Midshipmen a share of the national championship based on retroactive rankings by both the William Boand and Deke Houlgate mathematical poll systems.[3]\\r\\nThis remains Navy's only national championship.\\r\\nNavy has participated in 23 bowl games, garnering a record of 11ÿ11ÿ1.\\r\\nThe Navy-Army Game, played annually on the last weekend of the college football regular season in early December,[100] pits the football teams of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York (Army) against the Navy Midshipmen. It is one of the most traditional and enduring rivalries in college football, and is televised every year by CBS.[101] It was in the 1963 ArmyÿNavy game that instant replay made its television debut.[102]\\r\\nThis game has always had inter-service \\"bragging rights\\" at stake; in past decades, when both Army and Navy were often national powers, the game occasionally had national championship implications.[103] However, as top-level college football has developed and grown, the high academic entrance requirements, height and weight limits, and the military commitment required of West Point and Annapolis graduates has reduced the overall competitiveness of both academies in comparison with other football programs.[103]\\r\\nWhile Navy has had a resurgence in recent years, Army has struggled to post winning seasons. However, the tradition of the game has ensured that it remains nationally televised to this day. One of the great appeals of this game to many fans is that its players are largely playing for the love of the game, since almost none will ever play in the NFL. The game is especially emotional for the seniors, called \\"first classmen\\" or \\"firsties\\" by both academies, since it is typically the last competitive football game they will ever play.\\r\\nDuring wartime, the game is even more emotional because some seniors may not return once they are deployed. For instance, in the 2004 game, at least one senior from the class of 2003 who was killed in Iraq, Navy's J. P. Blecksmith, was remembered.[104] The players placed their comrade's pads and jerseys on chairs on the sidelines. Much of the sentiment of the game goes out to those who share the uniform and who are overseas.\\r\\nNavy-Army is played in early December, typically in Philadelphia.[105] The game, however, has also been played in other locations such as New York, Baltimore, Chicago, and Pasadena.[106]\\r\\nThe Commander-in-Chief's Trophy is awarded to each season's winner of the triangular college football series among the United States Military Academy (Army), the United States Naval Academy (Navy), and the United States Air Force Academy (Air Force).[107] Navy controlled the trophy from 2003 to 2009, marking one of the longest times any academy has had possession of the prestigious trophy.\\r\\nTypically, the NavyÿAir Force game is played in early October[107] followed by Army-Navy in early December.\\r\\nWhen Navy has possession of the trophy, it is displayed in a glass case in Bancroft Hall, the Midshipmen's dormitory. Navy has won 15 Commander-in-Chief's Trophies (1973, 1975, 1978, 1979, 1981, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2015).\\r\\nNavy has played Notre Dame in 87 annual games without interruption since 1927 with a record of 13ÿ76ÿ1.[108] Notre Dame plays this game to repay Navy for helping to keep Notre Dame financially afloat during World War II.[109][110][111] This series is scheduled to continue indefinitely.[112]\\r\\nFrom 1963, when Navy beat Notre Dame 35ÿ14, to 2006, Notre Dame won 43 consecutive games against Navy, the longest such streak in Division 1-A football.[113] This streak ended on November 3, 2007, when Navy beat Notre Dame 46ÿ44 in triple overtime.[84] Navy also bested Notre Dame in 2009 and 2010, which made the class of 2011 only the third class in Navy history to have beaten Notre Dame three times. Navy won 28-27 in 2016, making Coach Niumatalolo only the second coach in Navy history to defeat Notre Dame three times.\\r\\nWhen Navy is the home team for this game in even-numbered years, the Midshipmen have hosted the game off-campus at large stadiums used by NFL teams, usually FedExField in Landover, Maryland or M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.[114] The Midshipmen have also hosted the Irish at John F. Kennedy Stadium and Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia.[114]\\r\\nThe intrastate rivalry between Maryland and Navy is referred to as the \\"Crab Bowl Classic.\\"[115] Starting in 1905, the two teams have played sporadically over the years. Many of the early games were lopsided and Navy leads the series 14ÿ7. In 2005, the teams renewed their rivalry and Maryland won, 23ÿ20. The teams met again on Labor Day 2010 and Maryland won again, 17ÿ14, after the Terps' goal-line stand with under a minute remaining. As of 2010, the winner of the Crab Bowl Classic is awarded the Crab Bowl Trophy, created by the Touchdown Club of Annapolis with underwriting from the D'Camera Group. [116]\\r\\nThis rivalry stems from Navy and Rutgers being two of the only three programs (the third is Army) to come out of the original, informal \\"Ivy League\\" that are still members of the top tier of NCAA college football (currently Division I-FBS).[117] Although the two teams only began a regular series relatively recently in 1995, the games between the two schools are often close and sometimes have controversy as in the 2004 and 2007 editions of the series. The rivalry dates to 1891, making the two schools each other's oldest active football rivals.[118] The schools have met 25 times, with Rutgers leading the series at 13ÿ11ÿ1 all-time after the 2014 Navy loss. Navy and Rutgers have played most years since 1995, but do not have additional games scheduled at this time with Rutgers' move to the Big Ten and Navy's move from independents to the American.[119]\\r\\nThe Gansz Trophy was created in 2009 through a collaboration between the athletic departments of the Naval Academy and Southern Methodist University.[120] The trophy is named for Frank Gansz who played linebacker at the Naval Academy from 1957 through 1959. Gansz later served on the coaching staffs at numerous colleges, including all three service academies and Southern Methodist, as well as several professional teams. The two teams have met 18 times with Navy leading the all-time series 11ÿ7, and the trophy series 5ÿ0.[121]\\r\\nNavy and Pittsburgh recently renewed their rivalry, which began in 1912, and was played 26 times in 29 years between 1961 and 1989.[122] The contest was then played consecutively between 2007 and 2009 and again in 2013.[123] After a 44ÿ28 victory for Navy in the 2015 Military Bowl in Annapolis,[124] the series now stands with Pitt leading 22ÿ15ÿ3.[125] Of historic interest, it was during the Pitt-Navy game at Annapolis on October 23, 1976, that Pitt running back Tony Dorsett broke the NCAA career rushing record.[126]\\r\\nNavy has 19 players and 3 coaches in the College Football Hall of Fame:\\r\\n\\"The Most Prestigious Scholarships In College Football Since 1959\\"\\r\\nThe Athletic Hall of Fame is housed in Lejeune Hall. Among the exhibits are two Heisman Trophies, won by Joe Bellino in 1960 and Roger Staubach in 1963.[129]\\r\\nAnnounced schedules as of June 14, 2017[132]","input":"What state is the navy football team from?"},{"output":"causes unconsciousness","context":"Sodium thiopental, also known as Sodium Pentothal (a trademark of Abbott Laboratories, not to be confused with pentobarbital), thiopental, thiopentone, or Trapanal (also a trademark), is a rapid-onset short-acting barbiturate general anesthetic that is an analogue of thiobarbital. Sodium thiopental was a core medicine in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines,[3] which is a list of minimum medical needs for a basic healthcare system, but was supplanted by propofol.[4] Despite this thiopental is still listed as an acceptable alternative to propofol, depending on local availability and cost of these agents.[4] It was previously the first of three drugs administered during most lethal injections in the United States, but the U.S. manufacturer Hospira stopped manufacturing the drug and the EU banned the export of the drug for this purpose.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSodium thiopental is an ultra-short-acting barbiturate and has been used commonly in the induction phase of general anesthesia. Its use has been largely replaced with that of propofol, but retains popularity as an induction agent for rapid sequence intubation and in obstetrics.[citation needed] Following intravenous injection, the drug rapidly reaches the brain and causes unconsciousness within 30ÿ45 seconds. At one minute, the drug attains a peak concentration of about 60% of the total dose in the brain. Thereafter, the drug distributes to the rest of the body, and in about 5ÿ10 minutes the concentration is low enough in the brain that consciousness returns.[citation needed]\\r\\nA normal dose of sodium thiopental (usually 4ÿ6?mg/kg) given to a pregnant woman for operative delivery (caesarian section) rapidly makes her unconscious, but the baby in her uterus remains conscious. However, larger or repeated doses can depress the baby.[6]\\r\\nSodium thiopental is not used to maintain anesthesia in surgical procedures because, in infusion, it displays zero-order elimination kinetics, leading to a long period before consciousness is regained. Instead, anesthesia is usually maintained with an inhaled anesthetic (gas) agent. Inhaled anesthetics are eliminated relatively quickly, so that stopping the inhaled anesthetic will allow rapid return of consciousness. Sodium thiopental would have to be given in large amounts to maintain an anesthetic plane, and because of its 11.5- to 26-hour half-life, consciousness would take a long time to return.[vague][7]\\r\\nIn veterinary medicine, sodium thiopental is used to induce anesthesia in animals. Since it is redistributed to fat, certain lean breeds of dogs such as sight hounds will have prolonged recoveries from sodium thiopental due to their lack of body fat and their lean body mass. Conversely, obese animals will have rapid recoveries, but it will be some time[vague] before it is entirely removed (metabolized) from their bodies. Sodium thiopental is always administered intravenously, as it can be fairly irritating; severe tissue necrosis and sloughing can occur if it is injected incorrectly into the tissue around a vein.[citation needed]\\r\\nSodium thiopental decreases the cardiac stroke volume, which results in a decrease in cardiac output. The decrease in cardiac output occurs in conjunction with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, which results in hypotension. However, in comparison with propofol, the reflex tachycardia seen during states of hypotension is relatively spared (a bradycardia is common after administration of propofol) and therefore the observed fall in blood pressure is generally less severe.\\r\\nIn addition to anesthesia induction, sodium thiopental was historically used to induce medical comas.[8] It has now been superseded by drugs such as propofol because their effects wear off more quickly than thiopental. Patients with brain swelling, causing elevation of intracranial pressure, either secondary to trauma or following surgery, may benefit from this drug. Sodium thiopental, and the barbiturate class of drugs, decrease neuronal activity and therefore decrease the production of osmotically active metabolites, which in turn decreases swelling. Patients with significant swelling have improved outcomes following the induction of coma. Reportedly, thiopental has been shown to be superior to pentobarbital in reducing intracranial pressure.[9] This phenomenon is also called a reverse steal effect.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn refractory status epilepticus, thiopental may be used to terminate a seizure.\\r\\nSodium thiopental is used intravenously for the purposes of euthanasia. In both Belgium and the Netherlands, where active euthanasia is allowed by law, the standard protocol recommends sodium thiopental as the ideal agent to induce coma, followed by pancuronium bromide to paralyze muscles and stop breathing.[10]\\r\\nIntravenous administration is the most reliable and rapid way to accomplish euthanasia. A coma is first induced by intravenous administration of 20?mg/kg thiopental sodium (Nesdonal) in a small volume (10 ml physiological saline). Then, a triple dose of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug is given, such as 20?mg pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) or 20?mg vecuronium bromide (Norcuron). The muscle relaxant should be given intravenously to ensure optimal availability but pancuronium bromide may be administered intramuscularly at an increased dosage level of 40?mg.[10]\\r\\nAlong with pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride, thiopental is used in 34 states of the United States to execute prisoners by lethal injection. A very large dose is given to ensure rapid loss of consciousness. Although death usually occurs within ten minutes of the beginning of the injection process, some have been known to take longer.[11] The use of sodium thiopental in execution protocols was challenged in court after a study in the medical journal The Lancet reported autopsies of executed inmates showed the level of thiopental in their bloodstream was insufficient to cause unconsciousness.\\r\\nOn December 8, 2009, Ohio became the first state to use a single dose of sodium thiopental for its capital execution, following the failed use of the standard three-drug cocktail during a recent execution, due to inability to locate suitable veins. Kenneth Biros was executed using the single-drug method.[12]\\r\\nWashington is now the second state in the U.S. to use the single-dose sodium thiopental injections for death penalty executions. On September 10, 2010, Cal Coburn Brown was executed. This was the first execution in the state to use a single dose, single drug injection. His death was pronounced approximately one and a half minutes after the intravenous administration of five grams of the drug.[13]\\r\\nAfter its use for execution of Jeffrey Landrigan in the U.S., the UK introduced a ban on the export of sodium thiopental in December 2010,[14] after it was established that no European supplies to the U.S. were being used for any other purpose.[15] The restrictions were based on \\"the European Union Torture Regulation (including licensing of drugs used in execution by lethal injection)\\".[16] From 21 December 2011 the European Union extended trade restrictions to prevent the export of certain medicinal products for capital punishment, stating that \\"the Union disapproves of capital punishment in all circumstances and works towards its universal abolition\\".[17]\\r\\nThiopental (Pentothal) is still used in some places as a truth serum to weaken the resolve of a subject and make them more compliant to pressure.[18] The barbiturates as a class decrease higher cortical brain functioning. Some psychiatrists hypothesize that because lying is more complex than telling the truth, suppression of the higher cortical functions may lead to the uncovering of the truth. The drug tends to make subjects loquacious and cooperative with interrogators; however, the reliability of confessions made under thiopental is questionable.[19] \\"Sodium pentathol\\" as a truth serum has become a trope in films, comics and literature, and even appears in popular music.[20]\\r\\nPsychiatrists have used thiopental to desensitize patients with phobias,[21] and to \\"facilitate the recall of painful repressed memories.\\"[22] One psychiatrist who worked with thiopental is the Dutch Professor Jan Bastiaans, who used this procedure to help relieve trauma in surviving victims of the Holocaust.[23]\\r\\nSodium thiopental is a member of the barbiturate class of drugs, which are relatively non-selective compounds that bind to an entire superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, of which the GABAA receptor channel is one of several representatives. This superfamily of ion channels includes the neuronal nAChR channel, the 5HT3R channel, the GlyR channel and others. Surprisingly, while GABAA receptor currents are increased by barbiturates (and other general anesthetics), ligand-gated ion channels that are predominantly permeable for cationic ions are blocked by these compounds. For example, neuronal nAChR channels are blocked by clinically relevant anesthetic concentrations of both sodium thiopental and pentobarbital.[24] Such findings implicate (non-GABA-ergic) ligand-gated ion channels, e.g. the neuronal nAChR channel, in mediating some of the (side) effects of barbiturates.[25] The GABAA receptor is an inhibitory channel that decreases neuronal activity, and barbiturates enhance the inhibitory action of the GABAA receptor.[26]\\r\\nFollowing a shortage that led a court to delay an execution in California, a company spokesman for Hospira, the sole American manufacturer of the drug, objected to the use of thiopental in lethal injection. \\"Hospira manufactures this product because it improves or saves lives, and the company markets it solely for use as indicated on the product labeling. The drug is not indicated for capital punishment and Hospira does not support its use in this procedure.\\"[27] On January 21, 2011, the company announced that it would stop production of sodium thiopental from its plant in Italy because Italian authorities couldn't guarantee that exported quantities of the drug would not be used in executions. Italy was the only viable place where the company could produce sodium thiopental, leaving the United States without a supplier.[28]\\r\\nThiopental rapidly and easily crosses the blood brain barrier as it is a lipophilic molecule. As with all lipid-soluble anaesthetic drugs, the short duration of action of sodium thiopental is due almost entirely to its redistribution away from central circulation towards muscle and fat tissue, due to its very high fat:water partition coefficient (aprx 10), leading to sequestration in fat tissue. Once redistributed, the free fraction in the blood is metabolized in the liver. Sodium thiopental is mainly metabolized to pentobarbital,[29] 5-ethyl-5-(1'-methyl-3'-hydroxybutyl)-2-thiobarbituric acid, and 5-ethyl-5-(1'-methyl-3'-carboxypropyl)-2-thiobarbituric acid.[30]\\r\\nThe usual dose range for induction of anesthesia using thiopental is from 3 to 6?mg/kg; however, there are many factors that can alter this. Premedication with sedatives such as benzodiazepines or clonidine will reduce requirements, as do specific disease states and other patient factors. Among patient factors are: age, sex, and lean body mass. Specific disease conditions that can alter the dose requirements of thiopentone and for that matter any other intravenous anaesthetic are: hypovolemia, burns, azotemia, hepatic failure, hypoproteinemia, etc.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs with nearly all anesthetic drugs, thiopental causes cardiovascular and respiratory depression resulting in hypotension, apnea and airway obstruction. For these reasons, only suitably trained medical personnel should give thiopental in an environment suitably equipped to deal with these effects. Side effects include headache, agitated emergence, prolonged somnolence, and nausea. Intravenous administration of sodium thiopental is followed instantly by an odor and/or taste sensation, sometimes described as being similar to rotting onions, or to garlic. The hangover from the side effects may last up to 36 hours.\\r\\nAlthough individual molecules of thiopental contain one sulfur atom, it is not a sulfonamide, and does not show allergic reactions of sulfa/sulpha drugs.\\r\\nThiopental should be used with caution in cases of liver disease, Addison's disease, myxedema, severe heart disease, severe hypotension, a severe breathing disorder, or a family history of porphyria.[31][32]\\r\\nCo-administration of pentoxifylline and thiopental causes death by acute pulmonary edema in rats. This pulmonary edema was not mediated by cardiac failure or by pulmonary hypertension but was due to increased pulmonary vascular permeability.[33]\\r\\nSodium thiopental was discovered in the early 1930s by Ernest H. Volwiler and Donalee L. Tabern, working for Abbott Laboratories. It was first used in human beings on March 8, 1934, by Dr. Ralph M. Waters[34] in an investigation of its properties, which were short-term anesthesia and surprisingly little analgesia.[35] Three months later,[36] Dr. John S. Lundy started a clinical trial of thiopental at the Mayo Clinic at the request of Abbott.[37] Abbott continued to make the drug until 2004, when it spun off its hospital-products division as Hospira.\\r\\nThiopental is famously associated with a number of anesthetic deaths in victims of the attack on Pearl Harbor. These deaths, relatively soon after the drug's introduction, were said to be due to excessive doses given to shocked trauma patients. However, recent evidence available through freedom of information legislation was reviewed in the British Journal of Anaesthesia,[38] which has suggested that this story was grossly exaggerated. Of the 344 wounded that were admitted to the Tripler Army Hospital only 13 did not survive and it is unlikely that thiopentone overdose was responsible for more than a few of these.\\r\\nThiopental is still rarely used as a recreational drug, usually stolen from veterinarians or other legitimate users of the drug; however, more common sedatives such as benzodiazepines are usually preferred as recreational drugs, and abuse of thiopental tends to be uncommon and opportunistic.[citation needed]","input":"What does sodium pentothal do to the body?"},{"output":"Hector","context":"In Greek mythology and Roman Mythology, Hector (?ٶ Hektr, pronounced?[hkt??r]) was a Trojan prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the Trojan War. As the first-born son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, who was a descendant of Dardanus and Tros, the founder of Troy,[1] he was a prince of the royal house and the heir apparent to his father's throne. He was married to Andromache, with whom he had an infant son, Scamandrius (whom the people of Troy called Astyanax). He acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defense of Troy, \\"killing 31,000 Greek fighters\\", offers Hyginus.[2] During the European Middle Ages, Hector figures as one of the Nine Worthies noted by Jacques de Longuyon, known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, Homer places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. James Redfield writes of Hector as a \\"martyr to loyalties, a witness to the things of this world, a hero ready to die for the precious imperfections of ordinary life.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Greek, Hktr is a derivative of the verb ? khein, archaic form *? hkhein, 'to have' or 'to hold' from Proto-Indo-European *se?h- 'to hold'.[4] Hktr, or ktr as found in Aeolic poetry, is also an epithet of Zeus in his capacity as 'he who holds [everything together]'. Hector's name could thus be taken to mean 'holding fast'.[5]\\r\\nAccording to the Iliad, Hector does not approve of war between the Greeks and the Trojans.\\r\\nFor ten years, the Achaeans besieged Troy and their allies in the east. Hector commanded the Trojan army, with a number of subordinates including Polydamas, and his brothers Deiphobus, Helenus, and Paris. By all accounts, Hector was the best warrior the Trojans and all their allies could field, and his fighting prowess was admired by Greeks and his own people alike.\\r\\nDiomedes and Odysseus, when faced with his attack, described him as what Robert Fagles translated as an 'incredible dynamite', and a 'maniac'.\\r\\nIn the Iliad, Hector's exploits in the war prior to the events of the book are recapitulated. He had fought the Greek champion Protesilaus in single combat at the start of the war and killed him. A prophecy had stated that the first Greek to land on Trojan soil would die. Thus, Protesilaus, Ajax, and Odysseus would not land. Finally, Odysseus threw his shield out and landed on that, and Protesilaus jumped next from his own ship. In the ensuing fight, Hector killed him, fulfilling the prophecy.\\r\\nAt the advice of his brother, Helenus (who also is divinely inspired), and being told by him that he is not destined to die yet, Hector managed to get both armies seated and challenges any one of the Greek warriors to single combat.[6] The Argives were initially reluctant to accept the challenge. However, after Nestor's chiding, nine Greek heroes stepped up to the challenge and drew by lot to see who was to face Hector. Ajax wins and fights Hector to a stalemate for the entire day. With neither able to achieve victory, they express admiration for each other's courage, skill, and strength. Hector gave Ajax his sword, which Ajax later uses to kill himself. Ajax gives Hector his girdle, which later was used to attach Hector's corpse to Achilles' chariot by which he is dragged around the walls of Troy.\\r\\nThe Greek and the Trojans make a truce to bury the dead. In the early dawn the next day the Greeks take advantage of it to build a wall and ditch around the ships. Zeus is watching in the distance.[7]\\r\\nAnother mention of Hector's exploits in the early years of war was given in the Iliad book 9. During the embassy to Achilles, Odysseus, Phoenix and Ajax all try to persuade Achilles to rejoin the fight. In his response, Achilles points out that while Hector was terrorizing the Greek forces now, and that while he himself had fought in their front lines, Hector had 'no wish' to take his force far beyond the walls and out from the Skiaian Gate and nearby oak tree. He then claims, 'There he stood up to me alone one day, and he barely escaped my onslaught.' Another duel that took place, although Hector got help from Aeneas and Deiphobus, was when Hector rushed to try to save his brother Troilus from Achilles' hands. But he came too late and Troilus had already perished. All Hector could do was to take the lifeless body of Troilus while Achilles escaped after he fought his way through from the Trojans reinforcement.\\r\\nA 2004 film version of Troy has Achilles slaying Hector following a duel, whereas in the Iliad it is rather different. In the Iliad, Hector remains outside the walls, while his army flees into the city. As Achilles approaches, Hector stands his ground, fights and dies upon looking up at Troy. The film version of his death more resembles the single combat between the champions mentioned by Achilles in the Iliad, book 9.\\r\\nIn the tenth year of the war, observing Paris avoiding combat with Menelaus, Hector upbraids him with having brought trouble on his whole country and now refusing to fight. Paris therefore proposes single combat between himself and Menelaus, with Helen to go to the victor, ending the war.[8] The duel, however, leads to inconclusive results due to intervention by Aphrodite who leads Paris off the field. After Pandarus wounds Menelaus with an arrow the fight begins again.\\r\\nThe Greeks attack and drive the Trojans back. Hector must now go out to lead a counter-attack. His wife, Andromache, carrying in her arms their son Astyanax, intercepts him at the gate, pleading with him not to go out for her sake as well as his son's. Hector knows that Troy and the house of Priam are doomed to fall and that the gloomy fate of his wife and infant son will be to die or go into slavery in a foreign land. With understanding, compassion, and tenderness he explains that he cannot personally refuse to fight, and comforts her with the idea that no one can take him until it is his time to go.[9] The gleaming bronze helmet frightens Astyanax and makes him cry.[10] Hector takes it off, embraces his wife and son, and for his sake prays aloud to Zeus that his son might be chief after him, become more glorious in battle than he, and to bring home the blood of his enemies and make Hector's wife, his mother, proud. Once he left back for battle those in the house began to mourn as they knew he would not return.[9]\\r\\nHector and Paris pass through the gate and rally the Trojans, raising havoc among the Greeks.\\r\\nZeus weighs the fates of the two armies in the balance, and that of the Greeks sinks down. The Trojans press the Greeks into their camp over the ditch and wall and would have laid hands on the ships, but Agamemnon rallies the Greeks in person. The Trojans are driven off, night falls, and Hector resolves to take the camp and burn the ships next day. The Trojans bivouac in the field.\\r\\nA thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain ....[11]\\r\\nThe next day Agamemnon rallies the Greeks and drives the Trojans\\r\\nlike a herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them ...[12]\\r\\nHector refrains from battle until Agamemnon leaves the field, wounded in the arm by a spear. Then Hector rallies the Trojans:\\r\\n... like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea ...\\r\\nDiomedes and Odysseus hinder Hector and win the Greeks some time to retreat, but the Trojans sweep down upon the wall and rain blows upon it. The Greeks in the camp contest the gates to secure entrance for their fleeing warriors. The Trojans try to pull down the ramparts while the Greeks rain arrows upon them. Hector smashes open a gate with a large stone, clears the gate and calls on the Trojans to scale the wall, which they do, and\\r\\n... all was uproar and confusion.[13]\\r\\nThe battle rages inside the camp. Hector goes down, hit by a stone thrown by Ajax, but Apollo arrives from Olympus and infuses strength into \\"the shepherd of the people\\", who orders a chariot attack, with Apollo clearing the way. Many combats, deaths, boasts, threats, epithets, figures of speech, stories, lines of poetry and books of the Iliad later, Hector lays hold of Protesilaus' ship and calls for fire. The Trojans cannot bring it to him, as Ajax kills everyone who tries. Eventually, Hector breaks Ajax' spear with his sword, forcing him to give ground, and he sets the ship on fire.[14]\\r\\nThese events are all according to the will of the gods, who have decreed the fall of Troy, and therefore intend to tempt Achilles back into the war. Patroclus, Achilles' closest companion, disguised in the armor of Achilles, enters the combat leading the Myrmidons and the rest of the Achaeans to force a Trojan withdrawal. After Patroclus has routed the Trojan army, Hector, with the aid of Apollo and Euphorbus, kills Patroclus, vaunting over him:\\r\\n\\"Wretch! Achilleus, great as he was, could do nothing to help you.\\"[15]\\r\\nThe dying Patroclus foretells Hector's death:\\r\\n\\"You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already death and powerful destiny are standing beside you, to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus\\"[15]\\r\\nAlas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. ... death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it ÿ for so Zeus and his son Apollo the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.\\r\\nHector strips the armor of Achilles off the fallen Patroclus and gives it to his men to take back to the city. Glaucus accuses Hector of cowardice for not challenging Ajax. Stung, Hector calls for the armor, puts it on, and uses it to rally the Trojans. Zeus regards the donning of a hero's armor as an act of insolence by a fool about to die, but it makes Hector strong for now.[16]\\r\\nThe next day, the enraged Achilles renounces the wrath that kept him out of action and routs the Trojans, forcing them back to the city. Hector chooses to remain outside the gates of Troy to face Achilles, partly because had he listened to Polydamas and retreated with his troops the previous night, Achilles would not have killed so many Trojans. When he sees Achilles, however, Hector is seized by fear and turns to flee. Achilles chases him around the city three times before Hector masters his fear and turns to face Achilles. But Athena, in the disguise of Hector's brother Deiphobus, has deluded Hector. He requests from Achilles that the victor should return the other's body after the duel, (though Hector himself made it clear he planned to throw the body of Patroclus to the dogs) but Achilles refuses. Achilles hurls his spear at Hector, who dodges it, but Athena brings it back to Achilles' hands without Hector noticing. Hector then throws his own spear at Achilles; it hits his shield and does no injury. When Hector turns to face his supposed brother to retrieve another spear, he sees no one there. At that moment he realizes that he is doomed. Hector decides that he will go down fighting and that men will talk about his bravery in years to come. The desire to achieve ever-lasting honor was one of the most fierce for soldiers living in the timocratic (honor based) society of the age.\\r\\nHector pulls out his sword, now his only weapon, and charges. But Achilles grabbed his thrown spears that delivered to him by the unseen Athena who wore the Hades helmet. And then Achilles aimed his spear and pierced the collar bone section of Hector, the only part that the stolen Armor of Achilles that not protected Hector from it. That wound was fatal yet that wound also allowed Hector to speak to Achilles. Hector, in his final moments, begs Achilles for an honorable funeral, but Achilles replies that he will let the dogs and vultures devour Hector's flesh. (Throughout the Homeric poems, several references are made to dogs, vultures, and other creatures that devour the dead. It can be seen as another way of saying one will die.) Hector dies, prophesying that Achilles' death will follow soon:\\r\\nBe careful now; for I might be made into the gods' curse ... upon you, on that day when Paris and Phoibos Apollo...destroy you in the Skainan gates, for all your valor.[17]\\r\\nAfter his death, Achilles slits Hector's heels and passes the girdle that Ajax had given Hector through the slits. He then fastens the girdle to his chariot and drives his fallen enemy through the dust to the Danaan camp. For the next twelve days, Achilles mistreats the body, but it remains preserved from all injury by Apollo and Aphrodite. After these twelve days, the gods can no longer stand watching it and send down two messengers: Iris, another messenger god, and Thetis, the mother of Achilles. Thetis has told Achilles to allow King Priam to come and take the body for ransom. Once King Priam has been notified that Achilles will allow him to claim the body, he goes to his strongroom to withdraw the ransom. The ransom King Priam offers includes twelve fine robes, twelve white mantles, several richly embroidered tunics, ten bars of yellow gold, a special gold cup, and several cauldrons. Priam himself goes to claim his son's body, and Hermes grants him safe passage by casting a charm that will make anyone who looks at him fall asleep.\\r\\nThink of thy father, and this helpless face behold\\r\\nSee him in me, as helpless and as old!\\r\\nThough not so wretched: there he yields to me,\\r\\nThe first of men in sovereign misery!\\r\\nThus forced to kneel, thus groveling to embrace\\r\\nThe scourge and ruin of my realm and race;\\r\\nSuppliant my childrens murderer to implore,\\r\\nAnd kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!\\r\\nAchilles, moved by Priam's actions and following his mother's orders sent by Zeus, returns Hector's body to Priam and promises him a truce of twelve days to allow the Trojans to perform funeral rites for Hector. Priam returns to Troy with the body of his son, and it is given full funeral honors. Even Helen mourns Hector, for he had always been kind to her and protected her from spite. The last lines of the Iliad are dedicated to Hector's funeral. Homer concludes by referring to the Trojan prince as the \\"Breaker of Horses.\\"[18]\\r\\nThe most valuable historical evidence for the Battle of Troy are treaties and letters mentioned in Hittite cuneiform texts of the same approximate era, which mention an unruly Western Anatolian warlord named Piyama-Radu (possibly Priam) and his successor Alaksandu (possibly Alexander, the nickname of Paris) both based in Wilusa (possibly Ilion/Ilios), as well as the god Apaliunas (possibly Apollo).\\r\\nOther such pieces of evidence are names of Trojan heroes in Linear B tablets. Twenty out of fifty-eight men's names also known from Homer, including ??????, E-ko-to (Hector),[19] are Trojan warriors and some, including Hector, are in a servile capacity.[20] No such conclusion that they are the offspring of Trojan captive women is warranted. Generally the public has to be content with the knowledge that these names existed in Greek in Mycenaean times, although Page[21] hypothesizes that Hector \\"may very well be ... a familiar Greek form impressed on a similar-sounding foreign name.\\"\\r\\nWhen Pausanias visited Thebes in Boeotia, in the second century AD, he was shown Hector's tomb and was told that the bones had been transported to Thebes according to a Delphic oracle. Moses I. Finley observes[22] \\"this typical bit of fiction must mean that there was an old Theban hero Hector, a Greek, whose myths antedated the Homeric poems. Even after Homer had located Hector in Troy for all time, the Thebans held on to their hero, and the Delphic oracle provided the necessary sanction.\\"\\r\\nThe pseudepigraphical writer Dares Phrygius states that Hector \\"spoke with a slight lisp. His complexion was fair, his hair curly. His eyes would blink attractively. His movements were swift. His face, with its beard, was noble. He was handsome, fierce, and high-spirited, merciful to the citizens, and deserving of love.\\"[23]","input":"Who was the greatest warrior for the trojans?"},{"output":"Louis XII of France","context":"Mary Tudor (/?tju?d?r/; 18 March 1496 ÿ 25 June 1533) was an English princess who was briefly Queen of France and later progenitor of a family that claimed the English throne. The younger surviving daughter of Henry VII, King of England and Elizabeth of York, Mary became the third wife of Louis XII of France, more than 30 years her senior. Following his death, she married Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. The marriage, which was performed secretly in France, took place during the reign of her brother Henry VIII and without his consent. This necessitated the intervention of Thomas Wolsey, and although Henry eventually pardoned the couple, they were forced to pay a large fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary's second marriage produced four children, and through her eldest daughter Frances, Mary was the maternal grandmother of Lady Jane Grey, who was the de facto monarch of England for nine days in July 1553.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was the fourth child of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York, and the youngest to survive infancy. She was born at Sheen Palace, \\"most probably\\" in March 1496. A privy seal bill dated from midsummer 1496 authorizes a payment of 50 shillings to her nurse, Anne Skeron. Also, Erasmus stated that she was four years old when he visited the royal nursery in 1499ÿ1500.[1] At age six, she was given her own household, complete with \\"a staff of gentlewomen assigned to wait upon her,\\" a schoolmaster, and a physician. She was given instruction in French, Latin, music, dancing, and embroidery.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs children, Mary and her brother, the future King Henry VIII, shared a close friendship. He named his first surviving child, the future Queen Mary I, in her honour. They lost their mother when Mary was just seven, and given the number of bills paid to her apothecary from 1504 to 1509, it would appear that Mary's own health was fragile.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nKnown in her youth as one of the most beautiful princesses in Europe,[1] Erasmus said of her that \\"Nature never formed anything more beautiful.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1506, during a visit from Philip I of Castile, Mary was called to entertain the guests, dancing, and playing the lute and clavicord. In September 1506, Philip died, and on 21 December 1507, Mary was betrothed to his son Charles, later Holy Roman Emperor. The betrothal was called off in 1513.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, Cardinal Wolsey negotiated a peace treaty with France, and on 9 October 1514, at the age of 18, Mary married the 52-year-old King Louis XII of France at Abbeville. She was accompanied to France by four English maids of honour, one of whom was Anne Boleyn, under the supervision of her old governess lady Joan \\"Mother\\" Guildford, who acted as her principal lady-in-waiting.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite two previous marriages, Louis had no living sons, and sought to produce one, but he died on 1 January 1515, less than three months after marrying Mary, reputedly worn out by his exertions in the bedchamber, but more likely from the effects of gout.[4] Their union produced no children. Following Louis's death, the new king Francis I made attempts to arrange a second marriage for the beautiful widow.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had been unhappy in her marriage of state to King Louis XII, as she was almost certainly already in love with Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. King Henry VIII was aware of Mary's feelings; letters from her in 1515 indicated that she had agreed to wed Louis only on condition that \\"if she survived him, she should marry whom she liked.\\"[5] But Henry VIII wanted any future marriage to be to his advantage. The King's Council, not wishing to see Charles Brandon gain further power at court, were also opposed to the match. Meanwhile, rumors swirled in France that she would wed either Antoine, Duke of Lorraine or Charles III, Duke of Savoy. At one point, even King Francis I, perhaps in hope of his wife Queen Claude's death, was one of Mary's suitors in the first week of her widowhood; Mary asserted that she had given him her confidence in order to avoid his overtures. A pair of French friars went so far as to warn Mary that she must not wed Charles Brandon because he \\"had traffickings with the devil.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen King Henry VIII sent Charles to bring Mary back to England in late January 1515, he made the Duke promise that he would not propose to her.[6] Once in France, Mary persuaded Charles to abandon that pledge. The couple wed in secret at the Hotel de Clugny on 3 March 1515 in the presence of just 10 people, among them King Francis I.[7] Technically, this was treason as Charles Brandon had married a royal princess without King Henry's consent.[8] Thus Henry was outraged, and the privy council urged that Charles be imprisoned or executed. Because of the intervention of Thomas Wolsey, and Henry's affection for both his sister and Charles, the couple were given only a heavy fine[9][10] of S24,000 to be paid to the King in yearly installments of S1000, as well as the whole of Mary's dowry from King Louis XII of S200,000, together with the gold plate and jewels King Louis had given or promised her. The S24,000, approximately equivalent to S7,200,000 today, was later reduced by the King.[9] They officially later married on 13 May 1515 at Greenwich Palace in the presence of King Henry VIII and his courtiers.[1] In 1528, Charles secured a papal bull from Pope Clement VII legitimizing the marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was Charles Brandon's third wife, and he had two daughters, Anne and Mary, by his second marriage to Anne Browne, who had died in 1511. Mary raised the girls with her own children. Even after her second marriage, Mary was normally referred to at the English court as \\"the French Queen\\", and was not known as the Duchess of Suffolk in her lifetime,[11] despite being legally allowed to be. Mary spent most of her time at the Duke's country seat of Westhorpe Hall in Suffolk.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1520s, relations between King Henry VIII and his sister Mary were strained when she opposed the King's attempt to obtain an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, whom Mary had known for many years. Mary developed a strong dislike for Anne Boleyn (King Henry's intended wife),[13] whom she had first encountered in France.[1] Anne and her sister Mary Boleyn had been among the maids of honor in the entourage that had accompanied Mary to France for her wedding to King Louis XII.[14] In March 1532, Venetian Ambassador Carlo Capello wrote of an incident where \\"one of the chief gentlemen in the service of the said Duke of Norfolk, with 20 followers, assaulted and killed in the sanctuary of Westminster Sir William Peninthum, chief gentleman and kinsman of the Duke of Suffolk. In consequence of this, the whole Court was in an uproar.\\"[15] Though it was said to be caused by a private quarrel, he was \\"assured it was owing to opprobrious language uttered against Madam Anne by his Majesty's sister, the Duchess of Suffolk, Queen Dowager of France.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary suffered multiple bouts of illness, requiring treatments over her lifetime. She died, age 37, at Westhorpe Hall, Suffolk, on 25 June 1533, having never fully recovered from the sweating sickness she caught in 1528. The cause of death has been speculated to have been angina, tuberculosis, appendicitis, or cancer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an English princess, daughter of a king, sister to the current king, and a dowager queen of France, Mary Tudor's funeral and interment was conducted with much heraldic ceremony. A requiem mass was held at Westminster Abbey.  Her body was embalmed and held in state at Westhorpe Hall for three weeks. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 20th of July 1533, a delegation from France joined the English delegation for the lavish funeral ceremony. Her daughter Frances was chief mourner, accompanied by her husband and siblings. Mary's husband and her brother the king did not attend. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe funeral procession included 100 torch bearers, clergy carrying the cross, six horses pulling the hearse, other nobility and 100 of the duke's yeomen. The next day, followed a requiem mass and burial at Bury St. Edmunds Abbey.[17] After the death of Mary Tudor, her step-daughters, Anne and Mary, pushed themselves to the head of the funeral cortege just before the coffin was lowered into the crypt of the Abbey of St Edmundsbury, much to the consternation of their half-siblings.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFive years later, when the monastery was dissolved, Mary's body was removed to nearby St. Mary's Church, Bury St. Edmunds. In 1784, her remains were disinterred, her coffin opened, and locks of her hair were taken by Horace Walpole, the duchess of Portland, and several others.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary and Charles had four children, two daughters and two sons:\\r\\n\\r\\nMary and Charles raised their children at their home at Westhorpe Hall.

Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Krishna Raj and Parsottambhai Rupala are the Ministers of State.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAgriculture is the principal source of livelihood for more than half population of India. Agriculture provides the bulk of wage goods required by non-agriculture sectors and most of the raw materials for the industries sector. India is a largely agrarian economy - with 52.1% of the population estimated to directly or indirectly employed in agriculture and allied sectors in 2009-10.[3] The combined efforts of Central Government, State Governments and the farming community have succeeded in achieving record production of 244.78 million tonnes of foodgrains during 2010-11. This record production has been achieved through effective transfer of newly developed crop production technologies to farmers under various crop development schemes, such as the Agriculture MMP, which is run under the direction of the Department of Agriculture & Cooperation. Other causes behind record production include remunerative prices for various crops through enhanced minimum support prices.[4] Agriculture in India is of significance because of this as well as a history of food shortages and a growing population.\\r\\nDepartment of Revenue and Agriculture and Commerce was set up in June 1871 to deal with all the agricultural matters in India. Until this ministry was established, matters related to agriculture were within the portfolio of the Home Department.[5]\\r\\nIn 1881, Department of Revenue & Agriculture was set up to deal with combined portfolios of education, health, agriculture, revenue.

After its discovery, yeast became the fourth legal ingredient. For top fermenting beers, the use of sugar is also permitted.\\r\\nThere is a dispute as to where the Reinheitsgebot originated. Some Bavarians point out that the law originated in the city of Ingolstadt in the duchy of Bavaria on 23 April 1516, although first put forward in 1487,[4] concerning standards for the sale and composition of beer.\\r\\nThuringians point to a document which states the ingredients of beer as water, hops, and barley only, and was written in 1434 in Wei?ensee (Thuringia). It was discovered in the medieval Runneburg near Erfurt in 1999.[5] Before its official repeal in 1987, it was the oldest food-quality regulation in the world.[6]\\r\\nKellerbiers are unfiltered lagers which are conditioned in a similar manner to cask ales. Strength and colour will vary,[10] though in the Franconia region where these cask conditioned lagers are still popular, the strength will tend to be 5% abv or slightly higher, and the colour will tend to be a deep amber, but the defining characteristic is the cask conditioning. Kellerbier is German for \\"cellar beer\\".[11]\\r\\nZwickelbier was originally a sample amount of beer taken by a brewery boss from the barrel with the help of a special pipe called a \\"Zwickelhahn\\". Zwickelbiers are unfiltered lagers like Kellerbier, though with a slightly different conditioning process which gives the lager more carbonation. Zwickelbiers tend to be younger, lower in alcohol and less hoppy than Kellerbiers.[12]\\r\\nA very similar beer is Zoiglbier, which in the Upper Palatinate's brewing practice is advertised with a \\"Zoiglstern\\" (i.e., sign)  a six-pointed blue-and-white symbol made from wooden slats, similar to a Star of David.[13][14]\\r\\nWhile the beer market is weaker but more centralized in northern Germany, southern Germany has many smaller, local breweries.

In 2004, Oettinger replaced Krombacher as the best selling brand in Germany.[18]\\r\\nThe alcohol-by-volume, or ABV, content of beers in Germany is usually between 4.7% and 5.4% for most traditional brews.

It is commonly believed that a general somewhere promised his troops to drink beer from his boot if they were successful in battle. When the troops prevailed, the general had a glassmaker fashion a boot from glass to fulfill his promise without tasting his own feet and to avoid spoiling the beer in his leather boot. Since then, soldiers have enjoyed toasting to their victories with a beer boot. At gatherings in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, beer boots are often passed among the guests for a festive drinking challenge. Since the movie Beerfest appeared in 2006, beer boots have become increasingly popular in the United States. Glass beer boots are either manufactured using a mold or from mouth-blown glass by skilled artisans.\\r\\nIn Germany, beer boots usually contain between 2 and 4 litres and are passed from one guest at the table to the next one clockwise. When almost reaching the bottom of the boot, it suddenly starts bubbling. By some accounts, drinker who caused the bubbling has to order the next boot. There are also boots known with 6 and 8 litres. That being said, beer boots are almost never seen in Germany, even among friends who do drink as much and more beer on an evening out together; normal glasses are preferred.\\r\\nOktoberfest is a 16- to 18-day festival held annually in Munich, Bavaria, Germany, running from late September to the first weekend in October.

This bird is mainly a permanent resident, but northern birds may move south during harsh weather. This species has rarely been observed in Europe. This species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema Natur? in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos. The northern mockingbird is known for its mimicking ability, as reflected by the meaning of its scientific name, 'many-tongued mimic.' The northern mockingbird has gray to brown upper feathers and a paler belly. Its tail and wings have white patches which are visible in flight.[2]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird is an omnivore. It eats both insects and fruits. It is often found in open areas and forest edges but forages in grassy land. The northern mockingbird breeds in southeastern Canada, the United States, northern Mexico, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands and the Greater Antilles. It is replaced further south by its closest living relative, the tropical mockingbird. The Socorro mockingbird, an endangered species, is also closely related, contrary to previous opinion. The northern mockingbird is listed as of Least Concern according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird is known for its intelligence. A 2009 study showed that the bird was able to recognize individual humans, particularly noting those who had previously been intruders or threats. Also birds recognize their breeding spots and return to areas in which they had greatest success in previous years. Urban birds are more likely to demonstrate this behavior. Finally, the mockingbird is influential in United States culture, being the state bird of five states, appearing in book titles, songs and lullabies, and making other appearances in popular culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSwedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus first described this species in his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos.[3] Its current genus name, Mimus is Latin for \\"mimic\\" and the specific polyglottos, is from Ancient Greek poluglottos, \\"harmonious\\", from polus, \\"many\\", and glossa, \\"tongue\\",[4] representing its outstanding ability to mimic various sounds.[5] The northern mockingbird is considered to be conspecific with the tropical mockingbird (Mimus gilvus).[6]\\r\\nThis species is categorized as the northern mockingbird as the closest living relative to M. gilvus.[7][8]\\r\\nThere are three recognized subspecies for the northern mockingbird.[9][10] There have been proposed races from the Bahamas and Haiti placed under the orpheus section.[10]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird is a medium-sized mimid that has long legs and tail.[11] Males and females look alike.[12] Its upper parts are colored gray, while its underparts have a white or whitish-gray color.[13] It has parallel wing bars on the half of the wings connected near the white patch giving it a distinctive appearance in flight.[13] The black central rectrices and typical white lateral rectrices are also noticeable in flight.[13] The iris is usually a light green-yellow or a yellow, but there have been instances of an orange color.[9] The bill is black with a brownish black appearance at the base.[9] The juvenile appearance is marked by its streaks on its back, distinguished spots and streaks on its chest, and a gray or grayish-green iris.[9]\\r\\nNorthern mockingbirds measure from 20.5 to 28?cm (8.1 to 11.0?in) including a tail almost as long as its body. The wingspan can range from 31ÿ38?cm (12ÿ15?in) and body mass is from 40ÿ58?g (1.4ÿ2.0?oz). Males tend to be slightly larger than females.[14][15] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 10 to 12?cm (3.9 to 4.7?in), the tail is 10 to 13.4?cm (3.9 to 5.3?in), the culmen is 1.6 to 1.9?cm (0.63 to 0.75?in) and the tarsus is 2.9 to 3.4?cm (1.1 to 1.3?in).[9]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird's lifespan is observed to be up to 8 years, but captive birds can live up to 20 years.[16]\\r\\nThe mockingbird's breeding range is from Maritime provinces of Canada westwards to British Columbia, practically the entire Continental United States south of the northern Plains states and Pacific northwest, and the majority of Mexico to eastern Oaxaca and Veracruz.[9] The mockingbird is generally a year-round resident of its range, but the birds that live in the northern portion of its range have been noted further south during the winter season.[13] Sightings of the mockingbird have also been recorded in Hawaii (where it was introduced in the 1920s),[17] southeastern Alaska,[18] and twice as transatlantic vagrants in Britain.[13] The mockingbird is thought to be at least partly migratory in the northern portions of its range, but the migratory behavior is not well understood.[17]\\r\\nIn the nineteenth century, the range of the mockingbird expanded northward towards provinces such as Nova Scotia and Ontario and states such as Massachusetts, although the sightings were sporadic. Within the first five decades of the twentieth century, regions that received an influx of mockingbirds were Maine, Vermont, Ohio, Iowa, and New York.[17] In western states such as California, the population was restricted to the lower Sonoran regions but by the 1970s the mockingbirds was residential in most counties.[17] Islands that saw introductions of the mockingbird include Bermuda (in which it failed), Barbados, St. Helena, Socorro Island, the Cayman Islands and Tahiti.[17][19]\\r\\nThe mockingbird's habitat varies by location, but it prefers open areas with sparse vegetation. In the eastern regions, suburban and urban areas such as parks, gardens are frequent residential areas. It has an affinity for mowed lawns with shrubs within proximity for shade and nesting.[13][17] In western regions, desert scrub, chaparral are among its preferred habitats When foraging for food, it prefers short grass.[13] This bird does not nest in densely forested areas,[9][20] and generally resides in the same habitats year round.[17]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird is an omnivore. The birds' diet consists of arthropods, earthworms, berries, fruits, seeds, and seldom, lizards.[9] Mockingbirds can drink from puddles, river and lake edges, or dew and rain droplets that amass onto plants.[13] Adult mockingbirds also have been seen drinking sap from the cuts on recently pruned trees.[13] Its diet heavily consists of animal prey during the breeding season, but takes a drastic shift to fruits during the fall and winter.[13] The drive for fruits amid winter has been noted for the geographic expansion of the mockingbird, and in particular, the fruit of Rosa multiflora, a favorite of the birds, is a possible link.[9][13] Mockingbirds also eat garden fruits such as tomatoes, apples, and berries.[21][22]\\r\\nThese birds forage on the ground or in vegetation; they also fly down from a perch to capture food.[13] While foraging, they frequently spread their wings in a peculiar two-step motion to display the white patches. There is disagreement among ornithologists over the purpose of this behavior, with hypotheses ranging from deceleration to intimidation of predators or prey.[23][24]\\r\\nBoth the male and female of the species reach sexual maturity after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer.[11] The males arrive before the beginning of the season to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites.[11] They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings.[11] They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.[25][26]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird pairs hatch about 2 to 4 broods a year.[11] In one breeding season, the northern mockingbird lays an average of 4 eggs. They hatch after about 11 to 14 days of incubation. After about 10 to 15 days of life, the offspring become independent.[11]\\r\\nBoth the male and female are involved in the nest building.[27] The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground.[27] The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots.[14] The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both the male and female will feed the chicks.[27]\\r\\nThe birds aggressively defend their nests and surrounding areas against other birds and animals.[27] When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds from neighboring territories may be summoned by distinct calls to join the defense. Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass the intruder. In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs that they consider a threat,[11] mockingbirds will at times target humans. The birds are unafraid and will attack much larger birds, even hawks. One incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted in the distribution of a warning letter to residents.[28]\\r\\nNorthern mockingbirds are famous for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the beginning of breeding season to attract females.[29] Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males.[13] The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season.[30] Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male.[29] Unmated males are also more likely to use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range.[29] Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.[25]\\r\\nAn observational study by Logan demonstrates that the female is continuously evaluating the quality of the male and his territory.[31] The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory at the beginning of a new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new males territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males.[31] The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs.[31] At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.[13][31]\\r\\nNorthern mockingbirds adjust the sex ratio of their offspring according to the food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex at the beginning of a breeding season when the food is abundant.[32] Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males.[33] Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio.[34]\\r\\nNorthern mockingbirds are socially monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that males are a little larger in size than females. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds.[35] Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates.[35] In these cases, these female breeders have the option of changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense.[36] High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.[36]\\r\\nNorthern mockingbirds are altricial, meaning that, when hatched, they are born relatively immobile and defenseless and therefore require nourishment for a certain duration from their parents. The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there are higher levels of nestling predation than egg predation. The levels of belligerence exhibited by parents therefore increase once eggs hatch but there is no increase during the egg stage.[35]\\r\\nA recent study shows that both food availability and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time to care for the nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.[37]\\r\\nMockingbird nests are also often parasitized by cowbirds. The parents are found to reject parasitic eggs at an intermediate rate.[38] A recent study has shown that foreign eggs are more likely to be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season. Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely to reject foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites. If the breeding season of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.[39]\\r\\nAlthough many species of bird imitate the vocalizations of other birds, the northern mockingbird is the best known in North America for doing so. Among the species and vocalizations imitated are Carolina wren, northern cardinal, tufted titmouse, eastern towhee, house sparrow, wood thrush and eastern bluebird songs, calls of the northern flicker and great crested flycatcher, jeers and pumphandles of the blue jay, and alarm, chups, and chirrs of the American robin.[40][41] It imitates not only birds, but also other animals such as cats, dogs, frogs, crickets and sounds from artificial items such as unoiled wheels and even car alarms. As convincing as these imitations may be to humans, they often fail to fool other birds, such as the Florida scrub-jay.[42]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird's mimicry is likely to serve as a form of sexual selection through which competition between males and female choice influence a bird's song repertoire size.[42] A 2013 study attempted to determine model selection in vocal mimics, and the data suggested that mimicry in the mockingbird resulted from the bird being genetically predisposed to learning vocalizations with acoustic characteristics such as an enlarged auditory template.[40]\\r\\nBoth male and female mockingbirds sing, with the latter being generally quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall. Frequency in female singing is more sporadic, as it sings less often in the summer and fall, and only sings when the male is away from the territory.[13] The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately.[13] It continually expands its repertoire during its life,[13] though it pales in comparison to mimids such as the brown thrasher.[43]\\r\\nThere are four recognized calls for the mockingbird: the nest relief call, hew call, chat or chatburst, and the begging call.[13] The hew call is mainly used by both sexes for potential nest predators, conspecific chasing, and various interactions between mates. The differences between chats and chatbursts are frequency of use, as chats are year-round, and chatbursts occur in the fall.[13] Another difference is that chatbursts appear to be used in territorial defense in the fall, and the chats are used by either sex when disturbed.[13] The nest relief and begging calls are only used by the males.[13]\\r\\nA laboratory observation of 38 mockingbird nestlings and fledglings (thirty-five and three, respectively) recorded the behavioral development of young mockingbirds. Notable milestones included the eyes opening, soft vocalizations, begging, and preening began within the first six days of life. Variation in begging and more compact movements such as perching, fear crouching, and stretching appeared by the ninth day. Wing-flashing, bathing, flight, and leaving the nest happened within seventeen days (nest leaving occurred within 11 to 13 days). Improvements of flight, walking and self-feeding took place within forty days. Agonistic behavior increased during the juvenile stages, to the extent of one of two siblings living in the same area was likely killed by the other.[44]\\r\\nAdult mockingbirds can fall victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their tenacious behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus have been found in Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.[17]\\r\\nWinter storms limit the expansion of mockingbirds in its range. The storms have played a role in the declining of the Ohio populations (where it has since recovered), Michigan, Minnesota and likely in Quebec. Dry seasons also affect the mockingbird populations in Arizona.[17]\\r\\nIn a paper published in 2009, researchers found that mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds' nest. Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.[45]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird is a species that is found in both urban and rural habitats. There are now more northern mockingbirds living in urban habitats than non-urban environments, so they are consequently known as an urban-positive species.[46] Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds.[46] A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats. Lower food availability and travel costs may account for the higher mortality rate in rural habitats.[47] Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps.[47] Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas.[48] The adaptation of mockingbirds in urban habitats has led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. populations.[17]\\r\\nIt also features in the title and central metaphor of the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee. In that novel, mockingbirds are portrayed as innocent and generous, and two of the major characters, Atticus Finch and Miss Maudie, say it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because \\"they don't do one thing for us but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\"Hush, Little Baby\\" is a traditional lullaby, thought to have been written in the Southern United States, its key first lines, \\"Hush, little baby, don't say a word, Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird. And if that mockingbird don't sing, Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring.\\"\\r\\nThe song of the northern mockingbird inspired many classic American folk songs of the mid-19th century, such as \\"Listen to the Mocking Bird\\".[50]\\r\\nMockin' Bird Hill is a popular song best known through recordings by Patti Page, Donna Fargo, and by Les Paul and Mary Ford in 1951.\\r\\nThomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, had a pet mockingbird named \\"Dick\\".[51][52]\\r\\nThe northern mockingbird is the state bird of Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas,[53] and formerly the state bird of South Carolina.","input":"How many days for mockingbird eggs to hatch?"},{"output":"April 2006","context":"Google Translate is a free multilingual machine translation service developed by Google, to translate text, speech, images, sites, or real-time video from one language into another.

Och was the head of Google's machine translation group until leaving to join Human Longevity, Inc. in July 2014.[31]\\r\\nAccording to Och, a solid base for developing a usable statistical machine translation system for a new pair of languages from scratch would consist of a bilingual text corpus (or parallel collection) of more than 150-200 million words, and two monolingual corpora each of more than a billion words.[30] Statistical models from these data are then used to translate between those languages.\\r\\nTo acquire this huge amount of linguistic data, Google used United Nations and European Parliament transcripts.[32][33]\\r\\nGoogle Translate does not translate from one language to another (L1 L L2).

Google Translate performs well especially when English is the target language and the source language is from the European Union due to the prominence of translated EU parliament notes. A 2010 analysis indicated that French to English translation is relatively accurate.[52] However, if the source text is shorter, rule-based machine translations often perform better; this effect is particularly evident in Chinese to English translations. While edits of translations may be submitted, in Chinese specifically one is not able to edit sentences as a whole. Instead, one must edit sometimes arbitrary sets of characters, leading to incorrect edits.[52]\\r\\nShortly after launching the translation service, Google won an international competition for EnglishÿArabic and EnglishÿChinese machine translation.[53]\\r\\nSince Google Translate uses statistical matching to translate, translated text can often include apparently nonsensical and obvious errors,[54] sometimes swapping common terms for similar but nonequivalent common terms in the other language,[55] or inverting sentence meaning. Novelty websites like Bad Translator and Translation Party have utilized the service to produce humorous text by translating back and forth between multiple languages, similar to the children's game Chinese whispers.[56]\\r\\nIn 2017, Google Translate was used during a court hearing when court officials at Teesside Magistrates' Court failed to book an interpreter for the Chinese defendant.[57]","input":"When was google translate launched for the first time?"},{"output":"John Eric Winchester","context":"John Eric Winchester[1] is a fictional character on The CW's series Supernatural, and the protagonist of the comic book spin-off series Supernatural: Origins.[2] Developed by series creator Eric Kripke, the character is mainly portrayed by Jeffrey Dean Morgan.

He hid the truth from Adam to protect him, and never revealed to him the existence of Sam and Dean, nor vice versa.[11] Meanwhile, John trained Sam and Dean to become hunters. However, Sam later left this life to start anew in college, leading to a fallout between John and his son.[7]\\r\\nTwenty-two years after Mary's death, John disappears while on a hunt, forcing Sam and Dean to reunite in an unsuccessful attempt to find him. Sam returns to the life of a hunter after Azazel kills his girlfriend.[7] John reluctantly chooses to avoid his sons throughout most of the season while he investigates something,[12] eventually reuniting with them in the episode \\"Shadow.\\" However, the demonic Meg Masters attacks them and reveals that Azazel is after John. After escaping from Meg, the brothers split up from their father to keep him from the demons.[13] When vampires murder his old mentor and steal the Colta mystical gun capable of killing anythingJohn teams up with Sam and Dean in \\"Dead Man's Blood\\" to retrieve it. Because demons cannot be killed by conventional means, they hope that the Colt will be effective against Azazel.[14] In response, Meg begins killing the Winchesters' friends in \\"Salvation,\\" and threatens to kill more unless they deliver the Colt. John is captured after trying to give her a fake gun,[15] and reveals himself to be possessed by Azazel when the brothers come to his rescue in the first season finale \\"Devil's Trap.\\" However, he manages to resist the demon's control. Despite John's pleas for Sam to shoot him with the Colt, Sam cannot bring himself to do so and allows Azazel to escape. As the Winchesters flee in Dean's Impala, a demonically-possessed trucker crashes into them.[16]\\r\\nIn the second season premiere, \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" Sam and John awake in the hospital with only minor injuries, but a dying Dean is comatose. John secretly summons Azazel, and seems to know what the demon's plans are. He then makes a deal to save Dean, giving up his life, soul, and the Colt.[17] Before dying, John instructs Dean to kill Sam should he become evil.[18][19] The fourth season episode \\"On the Head of a Pin\\" reveals that the demon Alastair tortured John in Hell for over a century, with John refusing the demon's offer to stop if he himself would torture someone else.[20] His soul escapes from Hell in the second season finale \\"All Hell Breaks Loose, Part 2\\" when a gateway to Hell is opened. He saves Dean from Azazel, and distracts the demon by temporarily forcing him out of his host, long enough for Dean to kill Azazel with the Colt when he returns to his usual body. John then gives Sam and Dean a loving smile before becoming engulfed in a white light.[19] However, the fifth season episode \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" suggests that he might not be in Heaven.[21]\\r\\nActor Jeffrey Dean Morgan deemed John a \\"tormented soul,\\" [22] motivated by an \\"equal combination of revenge and protecting his sons.\\" [23] Following the death of their mother, Sam and Dean became secondary to John's quest of killing the demon responsible, although Morgan believed that this aspect changed once John began spending more time with them again.[23] Though he thought that John was not the world's best dad and \\"definitely made a lot of mistakes,\\" the actor noted that \\"he did things, even when they were wrong, for the good of his sons.\\" [22] John Kubicek of BuddyTV felt that this reasoning extended to John's decision to hide the truth from Adam to protect him. Kubicek also suggested that John became involved in Adam's life to achieve \\"some level of normalcy\\" as a father, an opportunity he had previously lost following the death of Sam and Dean's mother.[24] Overall, Morgan felt that John \\"loved those kids more than he loved his own life,\\" with the character's demonic pact with Azazel serving as \\"his way of finding redemption.\\" [25]\\r\\nRegarding his portrayal of the character, Morgan commented, \\"I played him with extra angst. I think what was on the page, what I foresawnot knowing where it was going, because no one would ever tell me anythingthere was always a lot more going on in his head than he was going to show anybody, including his sons. Because, indeed, there was a lot more going on.\\"[22] Kripke later confirmed this, stating, \\"It's our view that John knew everything the producers of the show know. John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal, that won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, and by the time he showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all.\\"[26]\\r\\nIn writing the pilot episode, series creator Eric Kripke made several dramatic revisions to John's storyline. The first draft of the script had Sam and Dean being raised by their aunt and uncle, though this was changed when Kripke realized that the backstory became much less complicated by having John raise them on the road. Another revision had John dying at the end of the episode instead of Sam's girlfriend Jessica.[27] Though he survives in the final version of the pilot, the writers decided halfway through production of the first season that John did have to die,[28] as they believed his separation from his sons \\"split the show\\" by having him away \\"doing more interesting things than the boys are doing.\\"[29] Kripke also felt that John kept Sam and Dean away from the \\"front lines\\", his death being required to allow the brothers to \\"explore, investigate and confront the yellow-eyed demon directly.\\" The writers initially intended for John to die in the car accident in \\"Devil's Trap,\\" but they ultimately postponed his death to prevent the finale from becoming too dark.[30] Following the character's eventual escape from Hell, executive producer Ben Edlund stated that even the writers are unsure of where John's soul ended up.[31]\\r\\nEvil Dead-actor Bruce Campbell was Kripke's first choice to portray the character. However, Campbell was unavailable,[32] and Jeffrey Dean Morgan eventually received the role. Due to the fact that Morgan's scene in the pilot episode takes place 22 years before the series, Morgan expected to be replaced by an older actor for subsequent episodes.[22] Being only 12 years older than Jensen Ackles, who portrays the eldest son Dean,[33] Morgan was surprised when he was asked to reprise the role.[22] Ackles and Jared Padalecki often teased him about the age difference during filming.[34] Throughout the season, Morgan became frustrated at times due to his character's avoidance of his sons, stating, \\"It pissed off everybody, it pissed off us as actors, it pissed off the audience watching, because none of us really knew where we were gonna go.\\" However, he reasoned that John's motivation for his actions was due to having knowledge that nobody else had.[23]\\r\\nDuring production of Supernatural's first season, Morgan was also working on the shows Weeds and Grey's Anatomy, so he was often traveling back and forth between Los Angeles and Vancouver. This interfered at times with Morgan's acting, as he had trouble getting \\"Winchester-y enough\\" after portraying the nice character of Denny Duquette on Grey's Anatomy.[33] Morgan commented, \\"I was stuck in Denny-land, where I was being too nice. Winchester's harder to find. Denny's more me. He's an intense guy, John is. And Denny, for a guy who's having trouble living, he's just a charming dude.\\"[33] Morgan was at first reluctant to return for Supernatural's second season due to his role on Grey's Anatomy.[35] Although he lent his voice for the third season episode \\"Long-Distance Call,\\" [36] future appearances of Morgan as the character after the second season have been hindered due to the actor's busy schedule. Nevertheless, both Kripke and writer Sera Gamble have stated that they \\"would love to have him back.\\"[36][37] The scheduling conflict has continued into the sixth season of Supernatural, with executive producer Robert Singer revealing that the writers had considered bringing the character back in the alternate reality episode \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" instead of Ellen Harvelle, but due to concerns that they would not be able to secure Morgan's return, they ultimately chose Ellen for the deceased character they would have (temporarily) return in the episode.[38] During the production of the fifth season, Morgan had an interview with MovieWeb in which he stated that no one from the show had contacted him about making another appearance, and expressed the desire to return for at least one more episode in what was then-believed to be the show's final season, as he had enjoying working with on-screen sons Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki and he felt that John's storyline had ended too soon.[39]\\r\\nWhile critics praised Morgan for his performance in the role, their reaction to the character has generally been mixed. Don Williams of BuddyTV felt that John is a \\"rather divisive character\\", with some fans not understanding John's motivation for keeping his sons in the dark. However, Williams himself found the character to be \\"completely fascinating\\". He chose \\"In My Time of Dying\\" as the second best episode of the series, mainly because of John's contributions, stating, \\"Even if you're not a huge fan of Poppa Winchester, I think it's impossible not to be moved by the final ten minutes of this episode... John's final speech to Dean, where he finally tells his son that he's proud of him, is one hell of a tear-jerker, and both Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jensen Ackles knock that scene out of the park.\\"[40] Williams praised Matt Cohen's performance of a younger version of the character in the time-travel episode \\"In the Beginning\\", believing that he \\"did an excellent job at portraying a more innocent John Winchester than we've ever seen before\\".[41]\\r\\nDiana Steenbergen of IGN also criticized John for his lack of explanation, feeling that \\"it is not exactly easy to watch John treat Dean and Sam so dismissively, especially after they have been nearly killing themselves all season to find him\\".[42] However, Steenbergen praised Morgan for his acting, writing, \\"Even though he is used sparingly throughout the series, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is always effective as John.\\"[43] She also felt that he brought \\"emotional weight\\" to the character, allowing the audience to \\"feel John's weariness, and his resignation that things will most likely not go well\\".[44] While Brian Tallerico of UGO enjoyed Morgan's performance, he was happy that the character was killed off because John's presence made Sam and Dean into \\"followers\\" that were \\"merely existing in the wake of their father\\". With their father gone, the brothers are no longer prevented from \\"heading up the battle with the other side\\".[45]\\r\\nNicholas Knight (2007). Supernatural: The Official Companion Season 1.

Its composition is intended to musically evoke the seemingly chaotic and rapidly changing flying pattern of a bumblebee. Despite the piece's being a rather incidental part of the opera, it is today one of the more familiar classical works because of its frequent use in popular culture.\\r\\nThe piece closes Act III, Tableau 1, during which the magic Swan-Bird changes Prince Gvidon Saltanovich (the Tsar's son) into an insect so that he can fly away to visit his father (who does not know that he is alive). Although in the opera the Swan-Bird sings during the first part of the \\"Flight\\", her vocal line is melodically uninvolved and easily omitted; this feature, combined with the fact that the number decisively closes the scene, made easy extraction as an orchestral concerto piece possible.[not verified in body][clarification needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the text of the scene where the Swan-Bird sings during this music:\\r\\n߿߻ƨ-׶þ:\\r\\n, ҿŤђ^,  缼춶^, , (Nu, teper', moy shmel', gulyay,)\\r\\n ־ ѿ ̾, (sudno v more dogonyay,)\\r\\nŤ^ Ť, (potikhon'ku opuskaysya,)\\r\\n־ Ͷ춶^ Ť^ ־.

Incidentally, this piece does not constitute one of the movements of the orchestral suite that Rimsky-Korsakov derived from the opera for concerts.\\r\\nThose familiar with the opera Tsar Saltan may recognize two leitmotifs used in the Flight, both of which are associated with Prince Gvidon from earlier in the opera. These are illustrated here in musical notation:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music of this number recurs in modified form during the ensuing tableau (Act III, Tableau 2), at the points when the Bumblebee appears during the scene: it stings the two evil sisters on the brow, blinds Babarikha (the instigator of the plot to trick Saltan at the beginning into sending his wife away), and in general causes havoc at the end of the tableau. The readers of Alexander Pushkin's original poem, upon which this opera is based, will note that Gvidon is supposed to go on three separate trips to Saltan's kingdom, each of which requires a transformation into a different insect.\\r\\n\\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\" is recognizable for its frantic pace when played up to tempo, with nearly uninterrupted runs of chromatic sixteenth notes. It is not so much the pitch or range of the notes that are played that challenges the musician, but simply the musician's ability to move to them quickly enough. Because of this and its complexity, it requires a great deal of skill to perform.\\r\\nIn the \\"Tsar Saltan\\" suite, the short version is commonly played, taking less than two minutes. In the Opera version, the three-minute fifty-five-second version is performed.\\r\\nAlthough the original orchestral version assigns portions of the sixteenth-note runs to various instruments in tandem, in the century since its composition the piece has become a standard showcase for solo instrumental virtuosity, whether on the original violin or on practically any other melodic instrument.

As a result, its major cities like Port Moresby and Lae have received increased international investor attention, giving rise to unprecedented building boom to exploit the opportunities presented by the country's rise as a regional economic leader in the South Pacific region. This is well supported by its strategic location as a Pacific's gateway to Asia as well as its comparatively huge landmass and demographic profile (almost 7 times that the rest of smaller Pacific Island nations). International Monetary Fund.[8] Despite this poverty it is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost of developing infrastructure.[9] Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for the bulk of the population. Mineral deposits, including oil, copper, and gold, account for 72% of export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy. In 1995, Port Moresby reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank on a structural adjustment program, of which the first phase was successfully completed in 1996. In 1997, droughts caused by the El Ni?o weather pattern wreaked havoc on Papua New Guinea's coffee, cocoa, and coconut production, the mainstays of the agricultural-based economy and major sources of export earnings. The coffee crop was slashed by up to 50% in 1997. Despite problems with drought, the year 1998 saw a small recovery in GDP. Growth increased to 3.6% in 1999 and may be even higher in 2000, say 4.3%.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economy generally can be separated into subsistence and market sectors, although the distinction is blurred by smallholder cash cropping of coffee, cocoa, and copra. About 75% of the country's population relies primarily on the subsistence economy. The minerals, timber, and fish sectors are dominated by foreign investors. Manufacturing is limited, and the formal labour sector consequently also is limited.\\r\\nIn 1999, mineral production accounted for 26.3% of gross domestic product. Government revenues and foreign exchange earning minerals. Copper and gold mines are currently in production at Porgera, Ok Tedi, Misima, Lihir, Simberi[10] and Hidden Valley.[11] As of 2014, talks of resuming mining operations in the Panguna mine have also resurfaced, with the Autonomous Bougainville Government and National Government of Papua New Guinea expressing interest in restarting mining operations in the area.[12] New nickel, copper and gold projects have been identified and are awaiting a rise in commodity prices to begin development. At early 2011, there are confirmation that Mount Suckling project has found at least two new large highly prospective porphyry bodies at Araboro Creek and Ioleu Creek.[13] A consortium led by Chevron is producing and exporting oil from the Southern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea. In 2001, it expects to begin the commercialization of the country's estimated 640?km3 (23 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas reserves through the construction of a gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea to Queensland, Australia. That project was shelved.\\r\\nPapua New Guinea produces and exports agricultural, timber, and fish products. Agriculture currently accounts for 25% of GDP and supports more than 80% of the population. Cash crops ranked by value are coffee, oil, cocoa, copra, tea, rubber, and sugar. The timber industry was not active in 1998, due to low world prices, but rebounded in 1999. About 40% of the country is covered with timber rich trees, and a domestic woodworking industry has been slow to develop. Fish exports are confined primarily to shrimp, although fishing boats of other nations catch tuna in Papua New Guinea waters under license.\\r\\nPapua New Guinea is the largest yam market in Asia.\\r\\nIn general, the Papua New Guinea economy is highly dependent on imports for manufactured goods. Its industrial sectorexclusive of miningaccounts for only 9% of GDP and contributes little to exports. Small-scale industries produce beer, soap, concrete products, clothing, paper products, matches, ice cream, canned meat, fruit juices, furniture, plywood, and paint. The small domestic market, relatively high wages, and high transport costs are constraints to industrial development.\\r\\nElectricity - production: 3.35 billion kWh (2012 est.)

In 1999, as mineral exploration and new minerals investments declined, as did United States exports. Crude oil is the largest U.S. import from Papua New Guinea, followed by gold, cocoa, coffee, and copper ore.\\r\\nU.S. companies are active in developing Papua New Guinea's mining and petroleum sectors. Chevron operates the Kutubu and Gobe oil projects and is developing its natural gas reserves. A 5,000ÿ6,000 m3 (30,000ÿ40,000 barrel) per day oil refinery project in which there is an American interest also is under development in Port Moresby.\\r\\nPapua New Guinea became a participating economy in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum in 1993. It joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1996.\\r\\nPapua New Guinea is highly dependent on foreign aid. Australia is the largest bilateral aid donor to Papua New Guinea, offering about US$200 million a year in assistance. Budgetary support, which has been provided in decreasing amounts since independence, was phased out in 2000, with aid concentrated on project development. Other major sources of aid to Papua New Guinea are Japan, the European Union, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China, the United Nations, the Asian Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. Volunteers from a number of countries, including the United States, and mission church workers also provide education, health, and development assistance throughout the country.\\r\\nBy mid-1999, Papua New Guinea's economy was in crisis. Although its agricultural sector had recovered from the 1997 drought and timber prices were rising as most Asian economies recovered from their 1998 slump, Papua New Guinea's foreign currency earnings suffered from low world mineral and petroleum prices. Estimates of minerals in exploration expenditure in 1999 were one-third of what was spent in 1997. The resulting lower foreign exchange earnings, capital flight, and general government mismanagement resulted in a precipitous drop in the value of Papua New Guinea's currency, the kina, leading to a dangerous decrease in foreign currency reserves. The kina has floated since 1994. Economic activity decreased in most sectors; imports of all kinds shrunk; and inflation, which had been over 21% in 1998, slowed to an estimated annual rate of 8% in 1999.\\r\\nCiting the previous government's failure to successfully negotiate acceptable commercial loans or bond sales to cover its budget deficit, the government formed by Sir Mekere Morauta in July 1999 successfully requested emergency assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

In lower mammals, they are relatively sparse, being found mainly on hairless areas such as foot pads. They reach their peak of development in humans, where they may number 200ÿ400/cm2 of skin surface.[4][5] They produce a clear, odorless substance, consisting primarily of water.\\r\\nEccrine glands are composed of an intraepidermal spiral duct, the \\"acrosyringium\\"; a dermal duct, consisting of a straight and coiled portion; and a secretory tubule, coiled deep in the dermis or hypodermis.[6] The eccrine gland opens out through the sweat pore. The coiled portion is formed by two concentric layer of columnar or cuboidal epithelial cells.[7] The epithelial cells are interposed by the myoepithelial cells. Myoepithelial cells support the secretory epithelial cells. The duct of eccrine gland is formed by two layers of cuboidal epithelial cells.[8]\\r\\nEccrine glands are active in thermoregulation by providing cooling from water evaporation of sweat secreted by the glands on the body surface and emotional induced sweating (anxiety, fear, stress, and pain).[5][6] The white sediment in otherwise colorless eccrine secretions is caused by evaporation that increases the concentration of salts.\\r\\nThe odour from sweat is due to bacterial activity on the secretions of the apocrine sweat glands, a distinctly different type of sweat gland found in human skin.\\r\\nEccrine glands are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, primarily by cholinergic fibers whose discharge is altered primarily by changes in deep body temperature (core temperature), but by adrenergic fibers as well.[9] The glands on palms and soles do not respond to temperature but secrete at times of emotional stress.\\r\\nThe secretion of eccrine glands is a sterile, dilute electrolyte solution with primary components of bicarbonate, potassium, and sodium chloride (NaCl),[5] and other minor components such as glucose, pyruvate, lactate, cytokines, immunoglobulins, antimicrobial peptides (e.g., dermcidin), and many others.[5]\\r\\nRelative to the plasma and extracellular fluid, the concentration of Na+ ions is much lower in sweat (~40 mM in sweat versus ~150 mM in plasma and extracellular fluid). Initially, within the eccrine glands, sweat has a high concentration of Na+ ions. The Na+ ions are re-absorbed into the tissue via the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) that are located on the apical membrane of the cells that form the eccrine gland ducts (see Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 of the reference).[8] This re-uptake of Na+ ions reduces the loss of Na+ during the process of perspiration. Patients with the systemic pseudohypoaldosteronism syndrome who carry mutations in the ENaC subunit genes have salty sweat as they cannot reabsorb the salt in sweat.[10] [11] In these patients, Na+ ion concentrations can greatly increase (up to 180 mmol/L).[10] [12]\\r\\nIn people who have hyperhidrosis, the sweat glands (eccrine glands in particular) overreact to stimuli and are just generally overactive, producing more sweat than normal. Similarly, cystic fibrosis patients also produce salty sweat. But in these cases, the problem is in the CFTR chloride transporter that is also located on the apical membrane of eccrine gland ducts.[8]\\r\\nDermcidin is a newly isolated antimicrobial peptide produced by the eccrine sweat glands.[13]","input":"How many eccrine glands are in the body?"},{"output":"31 August 1907","context":"The Triple Entente (from French entente [?t?t] \\"friendship, understanding, agreement\\") refers to the understanding linking the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente on 31 August 1907. The understanding between the three powers, supplemented by agreements with Japan and Portugal, was a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.\\r\\nHowever, Italy did not side with Germany and Austria during World War I and joined the Entente instead in the Treaty of London (1915).\\r\\nHistorians continue to debate the importance of the alliance system as one of the causes of World War I. At the start of World War I in 1914, all three Triple Entente members entered it as Allied Powers against the Central Powers: Germany and Austria-Hungary.[1]\\r\\nHowever, the Triple Entente, unlike the Triple Alliance or the Franco-Russian Alliance, was not an alliance of mutual defense. Thus, Britain felt free to make its own foreign policy decisions in the 1914 July Crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia had previously been a member of the League of the Three Emperors, an alliance in 1873 with Austria-Hungary and Germany. The alliance was part of German Chancellor Otto von Bismarcks plan to isolate France diplomatically; he feared that France's revanchist aspirations might make it to regain its losses in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War.[2] The alliance also served to fight against progressive sentiments, which the conservative rulers found unsettling, such as the First International.[3]\\r\\nHowever, the League faced great difficulty with the growing tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary, mainly over the Balkans, where the rise of nationalism and the continued decline of the Ottoman Empire made many former Ottoman provinces struggle for independence.[4]\\r\\nThe situation in the Balkans, especially in the wake of the Serbo-Bulgarian War and the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, which made Russia feel cheated of its gains made in the Russo-Turkish War, prevented the League from being renewed in 1887.[5]\\r\\nIn an attempt to stop Russia from allying with France, Bismarck signed the secret Reinsurance Treaty with Russia in 1887. The treaty assured that both parties would remain neutral if war broke out.[6]\\r\\nThe alliance between Russia and France and Bismarcks exclusion of Russia from the German financial market in 1887 prevented the treaty from being renewed in 1890. That ended the alliance between Germany and Russia.[7]\\r\\nAfter the Reinsurance Treaty was not renewed in 1890,[8] Russian leaders grew alarmed at the country's diplomatic isolation and joined the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1894.[7] Irish historian Ciaran Geraghty, a revisionist, claims that the lapse of the Reinsurance Treaty is the leading long-term cause for the First World War.[9]\\r\\nIn 1904, Britain and France signed a series of agreements, the Entente cordiale, mostly in solving colonial disputes.\\r\\nThat heralded the end of British splendid isolation and was partly a response to growing German antagonism, as expressed in the expansion of the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) to become a battle fleet that could threaten the supremacy of the British Royal Navy.\\r\\nThe Entente, unlike the Triple Alliance and the Franco-Russian Alliance, was not an alliance of mutual defence and so Britain was free to make its own foreign policy decisions in 1914. As British Foreign Office Official Eyre Crowe minuted, \\"The fundamental fact of course is that the Entente is not an alliance. For purposes of ultimate emergencies it may be found to have no substance at all. For the Entente is nothing more than a frame of mind, a view of general policy which is shared by the governments of two countries, but which may be, or become, so vague as to lose all content\\".[10]\\r\\nIn 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 to end their rivalry in Central Asia, nicknamed The Great Game.\\r\\nIn the last decade of the nineteenth century, Britain continued its policy of \\"splendid isolation\\", with its primary focus on defending its massive overseas empire. However, by the early 1900s, the German threat had increased dramatically, and in Britain thought it was in need of allies. For most of the 19th century, Britain had regarded France and Russia as its two most dangerous rivals, but with the growing threat of Germany, policy began to change for several reasons:\\r\\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War of 1870ÿ1871, Prussia defeated the Second French Empire, resulting in the establishment of the Third Republic. In the Treaty of Frankfurt, Prussia forced France to cede Alsace-Lorraine to the new German Empire. Ever since, relations had been poor.\\r\\nFrance, worried about the escalating military development of Germany, began building up its own war industries and army to deter to German aggression. Also, France developed a strong bond with Russia by ratifying the Franco-Russian Alliance, which was designed to create a strong counter to the Triple Alliance. Frances main concerns were to protect against an attack from Germany and to regain Alsace-Lorraine.\\r\\nRussia had by far the largest manpower reserves of all the six European powers, but it was also the most backward economically. Russia shared Frances worries about Germany. After the Germans started to reorganise the Ottoman army, Russia feared that they would come to control the Dardanelles, a vital trade artery that carried two fifths of Russia's exports.[11]\\r\\nThere was also Russia's long history of rivalry with Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary had recently annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, greatly angering Russia, which had considered itself the leader of the Slavic world (Pan-Slavism). Russia viewed the invasion as another step towards annexing Serbia and Montenegro.\\r\\nRussia had also recently lost the humiliating Russo-Japanese War, a cause of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the apparent transformation into a constitutional monarchy. To counter its enemies militarily and politically, Russia sought to revive the Franco-Russian Alliance.\\r\\nAlthough it was perceived as useless during the war with Japan, the alliance was valuable in the European theatre. Russia also signed the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 with Britain to counteract the threat of the Triple Alliance.\\r\\nThe alignment of the autocratic Russian Empire with Europe's two largest democracies was controversial on both sides. Many Russian conservatives mistrusted the secular France and recalled British past diplomatic maneuvers to block Russian influence in the Near East. In turn, prominent French and British journalists, academics and parliamentarians found the reactionary tsarist regime distasteful. Mistrust persisted even during wartime, with British and French politicians expressing relief when Tsar Nicholas II abdicated and was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government after the February Revolution in 1917. An offer of political asylum for the Romanovs was even withdrawn by the British king for fear popular reaction.[12] Also, France never brought up the subject of asylum with the deposed tsar.","input":"When was the triple entente formed between france britain and russia?"},{"output":"the 1990s","context":"The history of mobile phones covers mobile communication devices that connect wirelessly to the public switched telephone network.\\r\\nWhile the transmission of speech by radio has a long history, the first models that were wireless, mobile, and also capable of connecting to the standard telephone network are much more recent. The first such devices were barely portable compared to today's compact hand-held devices, and their use was clumsy.\\r\\nAlong with the process of developing a more portable technology, and a better interconnections system, drastic changes have taken place in both the networking of wireless communication and the prevalence of its use, with smartphones becoming common globally and a growing proportion of Internet access now done via mobile broadband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the devices existed that are now referred to as mobile phones or cell phones, there were some precursors. In 1908, a Professor Albert Jahnke and the Oakland Transcontinental Aerial Telephone and Power Company claimed to have developed a wireless telephone. They were accused of fraud and the charge was then dropped, but they do not seem to have proceeded with production.[2] Beginning in 1918, the German railroad system tested wireless telephony on military trains between Berlin and Zossen.[3] In 1924, public trials started with telephone connection on trains between Berlin and Hamburg. In 1925, the company Zugtelephonie A. G. was founded to supply train telephony equipment and, in 1926, telephone service in trains of the Deutsche Reichsbahn and the German mail service on the route between Hamburg and Berlin was approved and offered to first-class travelers.[4]\\r\\nIn 1907, the English caricaturist Lewis Baumer published a cartoon in Punch magazine entitled \\"Forecasts for 1907\\" in which he showed a man and a woman in London's Hyde Park each separately engaged in gambling and dating on wireless telephony equipment.[5] Then, in 1926, the artist Karl Arnold created a visionary cartoon about the use of mobile phones in the street, in the picture \\"wireless telephony\\", published in the German satirical magazine Simplicissimus.[6]\\r\\nThe portrayal of a Utopia of mobile phone in literature dates back to the year 1931. It is found in Erich K?stner's children's book The 35th of May, or Conrad's Ride to the South Seas:\\r\\nThe Second World War made military use of radio telephony links. Hand-held radio transceivers have been available since the 1940s. Mobile telephones for automobiles became available from some telephone companies in the 1940s. Early devices were bulky, consumed high power, and the network supported only a few simultaneous conversations. Modern cellular networks allow automatic and pervasive use of mobile phones for voice and data communications.\\r\\nIn the United States, engineers from Bell Labs began work on a system to allow mobile users to place and receive telephone calls from automobiles, leading to the inauguration of mobile service on 17 June 1946 in St. Louis, Missouri. Shortly after, AT&T offered Mobile Telephone Service. A wide range of mostly incompatible mobile telephone services offered limited coverage area and only a few available channels in urban areas. The introduction of cellular technology, which allowed re-use of frequencies many times in small adjacent areas covered by relatively low powered transmitters, made widespread adoption of mobile telephones economically feasible.\\r\\nOne of the earliest fictional descriptions of a mobile phone was the 1948 science fiction novel Space Cadet by Robert Heinlein. The protagonist, who has just traveled to Colorado from his home in Des Moines, receives a call from his father on a pocket telephone. Before going to space he decides to ship the telephone home \\"since it was limited by its short range to the neighborhood of an earth-side [i.e. terrestrial] relay office.\\" Ten years later, an essay by Arthur C. Clarke envisioned a \\"personal transceiver, so small and compact that every man carries one.\\" He wrote: \\"the time will come when we will be able to call a person anywhere on Earth merely by dialing a number.\\" Such a device would also, in Clarke's vision, include means for global positioning so that \\"no one need ever again be lost.\\" Later, in Profiles of the Future, he predicted the advent of such a device taking place in the mid-1980s.[7] U.S. TV series Get Smart (1965-1970) depicted spy gadgets with mobile telephones concealed in random objects, including shoes.\\r\\nIn the USSR, Leonid Kupriyanovich, an engineer from Moscow, in 1957-1961 developed and presented a number of experimental models of handheld mobile phones. The weight of one model, presented in 1961, was only 70 g and could fit on a palm.[8][9] However, in the USSR the decision at first to develop the system of the automobile \\"Altai\\" phone was made.[10]\\r\\nIn 1965, Bulgarian company \\"Radioelektronika\\" presented on the Inforga-65 international exhibition in Moscow the mobile automatic phone combined with a base station. Solutions of this phone were based on a system developed by Leonid Kupriyanovich. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to 15 customers.[11]\\r\\nThe advances in mobile telephony can be traced in successive generations from the early \\"0G\\" services like MTS and its successor Improved Mobile Telephone Service, to first-generation (1G) analog cellular network, second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks, third-generation (3G) broadband data services to the state-of-the-art, fourth-generation (4G) native-IP networks.\\r\\nIn 1949, AT&T commercialized Mobile Telephone Service. From its start in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1946, AT&T introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948. Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5,000 customers placing about 30,000 calls each week. Calls were set up manually by an operator and the user had to depress a button on the handset to talk and release the button to listen. The call subscriber equipment weighed about 80 lb.[12]\\r\\nSubscriber growth and revenue generation were hampered by the constraints of the technology. Because only three radio channels were available, only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time.[13] Mobile Telephone Service was expensive, costing 15 USD per month, plus 0.30 to 0.40 USD per local call, equivalent to about 176 USD per month and 3.50 to 4.75 per call in 2012 USD.[12]\\r\\nIn the UK, there was also a vehicle-based system called \\"Post Office Radiophone Service,\\"[14] which was launched around the city of Manchester in 1959, and although it required callers to speak to an operator, it was possible to be put through to any subscriber in Great Britain. The service was extended to London in 1965 and other major cities in 1972.\\r\\nAT&T introduced the first major improvement to mobile telephony in 1965, giving the improved service the obvious name of Improved Mobile Telephone Service. IMTS used additional radio channels, allowing more simultaneous calls in a given geographic area, introduced customer dialing, eliminating manual call setup by an operator, and reduced the size and weight of the subscriber equipment.[12]\\r\\nDespite the capacity improvement offered by IMTS, demand outstripped capacity. In agreement with state regulatory agencies, AT&T limited the service to just 40,000 customers system wide. In New York City, for example, 2,000 customers shared just 12 radio channels and typically had to wait 30 minutes to place a call.[12]\\r\\nRadio Common Carrier [15] or RCC was a service introduced in the 1960s by independent telephone companies to compete against AT&T's IMTS. RCC systems used paired UHF 454/459?MHz and VHF 152/158?MHz frequencies near those used by IMTS. RCC based services were provided until the 1980s when cellular AMPS systems made RCC equipment obsolete.\\r\\nSome RCC systems were designed to allow customers of adjacent carriers to use their facilities, but equipment used by RCCs did not allow the equivalent of modern \\"roaming\\" because technical standards were not uniform. For example, the phone of an Omaha, Nebraskaÿbased RCC service would not be likely to work in Phoenix, Arizona. Roaming was not encouraged, in part, because there was no centralized industry billing database for RCCs. Signaling formats were not standardized. For example, some systems used two-tone sequential paging to alert a mobile of an incoming call. Other systems used DTMF. Some used Secode 2805, which transmitted an interrupted 2805?Hz tone (similar to IMTS signaling) to alert mobiles of an offered call. Some radio equipment used with RCC systems was half-duplex, push-to-talk LOMO equipment such as Motorola hand-helds or RCA 700-series conventional two-way radios. Other vehicular equipment had telephone handsets and rotary dials or pushbutton pads, and operated full duplex like a conventional wired telephone. A few users had full-duplex briefcase telephones (radically advanced for their day)\\r\\nAt the end of RCC's existence, industry associations were working on a technical standard that would have allowed roaming, and some mobile users had multiple decoders to enable operation with more than one of the common signaling formats (600/1500, 2805, and Reach). Manual operation was often a fallback for RCC roamers.\\r\\nIn 1969 Penn Central Railroad equipped commuter trains along the 360 km New York-Washington route with special pay phones that allowed passengers to place telephone calls while the train was moving. The system re-used six frequencies in the 450?MHz band in nine sites.[13]\\r\\nIn the UK, Channel Islands and elsewhere the \\"Rabbit\\" phone system was briefly used, being a hybrid of \\"cell\\" base stations and handsets. One major limitation was that you had to be less than 300 feet (closer with buildings) from a base due to power limitations on a portable device. [16] With modern technology a similar variant is being considered for Apple's new 4G \\"smart watch\\" so they can be used in large events in a broadly similar way to a femtocell.\\r\\nIn Europe, several mutually incompatible mobile radio services were developed.\\r\\nIn 1966 Norway had a system called OLT which was manually controlled. Finland's ARP, launched in 1971, was also manual as was the Swedish MTD. All were replaced by the automatic NMT, (Nordic Mobile Telephone) system in the early 1980s.\\r\\nIn July 1971 Readycall was introduced in London by Burndept after obtaining a special concession to break the Post Office monopoly to allow selective calling to mobiles of calls from the public telephone system. This system was available to the public for a subscription of S16 month. A year later the service was extended to two other UK towns.[17]\\r\\nWest Germany had a network called A-Netz launched in 1952 as the country's first public commercial mobile phone network. In 1972 this was displaced by B-Netz which connected calls automatically.\\r\\nIn December 1947, Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young, Bell Labs engineers, proposed hexagonal cells for mobile phones in vehicles.[18] At this stage, the technology to implement these ideas did not exist, nor had the frequencies been allocated. Two decades would pass before Richard H. Frenkiel, Joel S. Engel and Philip T. Porter of Bell Labs expanded the early proposals into a much more detailed system plan. It was Porter who first proposed that the cell towers use the now-familiar directional antennas to reduce interference and increase channel reuse (see picture at right) [19] Porter also invented the dial-then-send method used by all cell phones to reduce wasted channel time.\\r\\nIn all these early examples, a mobile phone had to stay within the coverage area serviced by one base station throughout the phone call, i.e. there was no continuity of service as the phones moved through several cell areas. The concepts of frequency reuse and handoff, as well as a number of other concepts that formed the basis of modern cell phone technology, were described in the late 1960s, in papers by Frenkiel and Porter. In 1970 Amos E. Joel, Jr., a Bell Labs engineer,[20] invented a \\"three-sided trunk circuit\\" to aid in the \\"call handoff\\" process from one cell to another. His patent contained an early description of the Bell Labs cellular concept, but as switching systems became faster, such a circuit became unnecessary and was never implemented in a system.\\r\\nA cellular telephone switching plan was described by Fluhr and Nussbaum in 1973,[21] and a cellular telephone data signaling system was described in 1977 by Hachenburg et al.[22]\\r\\nThe first fully automated mobile phone system for vehicles was launched in Sweden in 1956. Named MTA (Mobiltelefonisystem A), it allowed calls to be made and received in the car using a rotary dial. The car phone could also be paged. Calls from the car were direct dial, whereas incoming calls required an operator to locate the nearest base station to the car. It was developed by Sture Laurn and other engineers at Televerket network operator. Ericsson provided the switchboard while Svenska Radioaktiebolaget (SRA) and Marconi provided the telephones and base station equipment. MTA phones consisted of vacuum tubes and relays, and weighed 40?kg. In 1962, an upgraded version called Mobile System B (MTB) was introduced. This was a push-button telephone, and used transistors and DTMF signaling to improve its operational reliability. In 1971 the MTD version was launched, opening for several different brands of equipment and gaining commercial success.[23][24] The network remained open until 1983 and still had 600 customers when it closed.\\r\\nIn 1958 development began on a similar system for motorists in the USSR.[25] The \\"Altay\\" national civil mobile phone service was based on Soviet MRT-1327 standard. The main developers of the Altay system were the Voronezh Science Research Institute of Communications (VNIIS) and the State Specialized Project Institute (GSPI). In 1963 the service started in Moscow, and by 1970 was deployed in 30 cities across the USSR. Versions of the Altay system are still in use today as a trunking system in some parts of Russia.\\r\\nIn 1959 a private telephone company in Brewster, Kansas, USA, the S&T Telephone Company, (still in business today) with the use of Motorola Radio Telephone equipment and a private tower facility, offered to the public mobile telephone services in that local area of NW Kansas. This system was a direct dial up service through their local switchboard, and was installed in many private vehicles including grain combines, trucks, and automobiles. For some as yet unknown reason, the system, after being placed online and operated for a very brief time period, was shut down. The management of the company was immediately changed, and the fully operable system and related equipment was immediately dismantled in early 1960, not to be seen again.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1966, Bulgaria presented the pocket mobile automatic phone RAT-0,5 combined with a base station RATZ-10 (RATC-10) on Interorgtechnika-66 international exhibition. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to six customers (\\"Radio\\" magazine, 2, 1967; \\"Novosti dnya\\" newsreel, 37, 1966).\\r\\nOne of the first successful public commercial mobile phone networks was the ARP network in Finland, launched in 1971. Posthumously, ARP is sometimes viewed as a zero generation (0G) cellular network, being slightly above previous proprietary and limited coverage networks.[citation needed]\\r\\nPrior to 1973, mobile telephony was limited to phones installed in cars and other vehicles.[20] Motorola was the first company to produce a handheld mobile phone. On April 3, 1973, Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive, made the first mobile telephone call from handheld subscriber equipment, placing a call to Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs, his rival.[26][27] The prototype handheld phone used by Dr. Cooper weighed 1.1 kg (2.42 lb) and measured 23 cm long, 13 cm deep and 4.45 cm wide. The prototype offered a talk time of just 30 minutes and took 10 hours to re-charge.[28]\\r\\nJohn F. Mitchell,[29][30][31] Motorola's chief of portable communication products and Cooper's boss in 1973, played a key role in advancing the development of handheld mobile telephone equipment. Mitchell successfully pushed Motorola to develop wireless communication products that would be small enough to use anywhere and participated in the design of the cellular phone.[32][33]\\r\\nNewer technology has been developed and rolled out in a series of waves or generations. The \\"generation\\" terminology only became widely used when 3G was launched, but is now used retroactively when referring to the earlier systems.\\r\\nFirst automatic analogue cellular systems deployed were NTT's system first used in Tokyo in 1979, later spreading to the whole of Japan, and NMT in the Nordic countries in 1981.\\r\\nThe first analogue cellular system widely deployed in North America was the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS).[34] It was commercially introduced in the Americas in 13 October 1983, Israel in 1986, and Australia in 1987. AMPS was a pioneering technology that helped drive mass market usage of cellular technology, but it had several serious issues by modern standards. It was unencrypted and easily vulnerable to eavesdropping via a scanner; it was susceptible to cell phone \\"cloning\\" and it used a Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) scheme and required significant amounts of wireless spectrum to support.\\r\\nOn 6 March 1983, the DynaTAC 8000X mobile phone launched on the first US 1G network by Ameritech. It cost $100m to develop, and took over a decade to reach the market.[35] The phone had a talk time of just thirty-five minutes and took ten hours to charge. Consumer demand was strong despite the battery life, weight, and low talk time, and waiting lists were in the thousands.[36][37]\\r\\nMany of the iconic early commercial cell phones such as the Motorola DynaTAC Analog AMPS were eventually superseded by Digital AMPS (D-AMPS) in 1990, and AMPS service was shut down by most North American carriers by 2008.\\r\\nIn February 1986 Australia launched its Cellular Telephone System by Telecom Australia. Peter Reedman was the first Telecom Customer to be connected on 6 January 1986 along with five other subscribers as test customers prior to the official launch date of 28 February.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the 'second generation' mobile phone systems emerged. Two systems competed for supremacy in the global market: the European developed GSM standard and the U.S. developed CDMA standard. These differed from the previous generation by using digital instead of analog transmission, and also fast out-of-band phone-to-network signaling. The rise in mobile phone usage as a result of 2G was explosive and this era also saw the advent of prepaid mobile phones.\\r\\nIn 1991 the first GSM network (Radiolinja) launched in Finland. In general the frequencies used by 2G systems in Europe were higher than those in America, though with some overlap. For example, the 900?MHz frequency range was used for both 1G and 2G systems in Europe, so the 1G systems were rapidly closed down to make space for the 2G systems. In America the IS-54 standard was deployed in the same band as AMPS and displaced some of the existing analog channels.\\r\\nIn 1993, IBM Simon was introduced. This was possibly the world's first smartphone. It was a mobile phone, pager, fax machine, and PDA all rolled into one. It included a calendar, address book, clock, calculator, notepad, email, and a touchscreen with a QWERTY keyboard.[38] The IBM Simon had a stylus you used to tap the touch screen with. It featured predictive typing that would guess the next characters as you tapped. It had applications, or at least a way to deliver more features by plugging a PCMCIA 1.8 MB memory card into the phone.[39] Coinciding with the introduction of 2G systems was a trend away from the larger \\"brick\\" phones toward tiny 100 ÿ 200 gram hand-held devices. This change was possible not only through technological improvements such as more advanced batteries and more energy-efficient electronics, but also because of the higher density of cell sites to accommodate increasing usage. The latter meant that the average distance transmission from phone to the base station shortened, leading to increased battery life while on the move.\\r\\nThe second generation introduced a new variant of communication called SMS or text messaging. It was initially available only on GSM networks but spread eventually on all digital networks. The first machine-generated SMS message was sent in the UK on 3 December 1992 followed in 1993 by the first person-to-person SMS sent in Finland. The advent of prepaid services in the late 1990s soon made SMS the communication method of choice among the young, a trend which spread across all ages.\\r\\n2G also introduced the ability to access media content on mobile phones. In 1998 the first downloadable content sold to mobile phones was the ring tone, launched by Finland's Radiolinja (now Elisa). Advertising on the mobile phone first appeared in Finland when a free daily SMS news headline service was launched in 2000, sponsored by advertising.\\r\\nMobile payments were trialed in 1998 in Finland and Sweden where a mobile phone was used to pay for a Coca-Cola vending machine and car parking. Commercial launches followed in 1999 in Norway. The first commercial payment system to mimic banks and credit cards was launched in the Philippines in 1999 simultaneously by mobile operators Globe and Smart.\\r\\nThe first full internet service on mobile phones was introduced by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in 1999.\\r\\nAs the use of 2G phones became more widespread and people began to use mobile phones in their daily lives, it became clear that demand for data (such as access to browse the internet) was growing. Further, experience from fixed broadband services showed there would also be an ever-increasing demand for greater data speeds. The 2G technology was nowhere near up to the job, so the industry began to work on the next generation of technology known as 3G. The main technological difference that distinguishes 3G technology from 2G technology is the use of packet switching rather than circuit switching for data transmission.[40] In addition, the standardization process focused on requirements more than technology (2 Mbit/s maximum data rate indoors, 384 kbit/s outdoors, for example).\\r\\nInevitably this led to many competing standards with different contenders pushing their own technologies, and the vision of a single unified worldwide standard looked far from reality. The standard 2G CDMA networks became 3G compliant with the adoption of Revision A to EV-DO, which made several additions to the protocol while retaining backwards compatibility:\\r\\nAll these were put in place to allow for low latency, low bit rate communications such as VoIP.[41]\\r\\nThe first pre-commercial trial network with 3G was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in the Tokyo region in May 2001. NTT DoCoMo launched the first commercial 3G network on 1 October 2001, using the WCDMA technology. In 2002 the first 3G networks on the rival CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology were launched by SK Telecom and KTF in South Korea, and Monet in the US. Monet has since gone bankrupt. By the end of 2002, the second WCDMA network was launched in Japan by Vodafone KK (now Softbank). European launches of 3G were in Italy and the UK by Three/Hutchison group, on WCDMA. 2003 saw a further eight commercial launches of 3G, six more on WCDMA and two more on the EV-DO standard.\\r\\nDuring the development of 3G systems, 2.5G systems such as CDMA2000 1x and GPRS were developed as extensions to existing 2G networks. These provide some of the features of 3G without fulfilling the promised high data rates or full range of multimedia services. CDMA2000-1X delivers theoretical maximum data speeds of up to 307 kbit/s. Just beyond these is the EDGE system which in theory covers the requirements for 3G system, but is so narrowly above these that any practical system would be sure to fall short.\\r\\nThe high connection speeds of 3G technology enabled a transformation in the industry: for the first time, media streaming of radio (and even television) content to 3G handsets became possible,[42] with companies such as RealNetworks[43] and Disney[44] among the early pioneers in this type of offering.\\r\\nIn the mid-2000s (decade), an evolution of 3G technology began to be implemented, namely High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA). It is an enhanced 3G (third generation) mobile telephony communications protocol in the High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) family, also coined 3.5G, 3G+ or turbo 3G, which allows networks based on Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity. Current HSDPA deployments support down-link speeds of 1.8, 3.6, 7.2 and 14.0 Mbit/s.\\r\\nBy the end of 2007, there were 295 million subscribers on 3G networks worldwide, which reflected 9% of the total worldwide subscriber base. About two thirds of these were on the WCDMA standard and one third on the EV-DO standard. The 3G telecoms services generated over $120 billion of revenues during 2007 and at many markets the majority of new phones activated were 3G phones. In Japan and South Korea the market no longer supplies phones of the second generation.\\r\\nAlthough mobile phones had long had the ability to access data networks such as the Internet, it was not until the widespread availability of good quality 3G coverage in the mid-2000s (decade) that specialized devices appeared to access the mobile web. The first such devices, known as \\"dongles\\", plugged directly into a computer through the USB port. Another new class of device appeared subsequently, the so-called \\"compact wireless router\\" such as the Novatel MiFi, which makes 3G Internet connectivity available to multiple computers simultaneously over Wi-Fi, rather than just to a single computer via a USB plug-in.\\r\\nSuch devices became especially popular for use with laptop computers due to the added portability they bestow. Consequently, some computer manufacturers started to embed the mobile data function directly into the laptop so a dongle or MiFi wasn't needed. Instead, the SIM card could be inserted directly into the device itself to access the mobile data services. Such 3G-capable laptops became commonly known as \\"netbooks\\". Other types of data-aware devices followed in the netbook's footsteps. By the beginning of 2010, E-readers, such as the Amazon Kindle and the Nook from Barnes & Noble, had already become available with embedded wireless Internet, and Apple had announced plans for embedded wireless Internet on its iPad tablet devices later that year.\\r\\nBy 2009, it had become clear that, at some point, 3G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth-intensive applications like streaming media.[45] Consequently, the industry began looking to data-optimized 4th-generation technologies, with the promise of speed improvements up to 10-fold over existing 3G technologies. The first two commercially available technologies billed as 4G were the WiMAX standard (offered in the U.S. by Sprint) and the LTE standard, first offered in Scandinavia by TeliaSonera.\\r\\nOne of the main ways in which 4G differed technologically from 3G was in its elimination of circuit switching, instead employing an all-IP network. Thus, 4G ushered in a treatment of voice calls just like any other type of streaming audio media, utilizing packet switching over Internet, LAN or WAN networks via VoIP.[46]\\r\\nAs well as the now-common cellular phone, there is also the very different approach of connecting directly from the handset to an Earth-orbiting satellite. Such mobile phones can be used in remote areas out of reach of wired networks or where construction of a cellular network is uneconomic.\\r\\nThe Inmarsat system is the oldest, originally developed in 1979 for safety of life at sea, and uses a series of satellites in geostationary orbits to cover the majority of the globe. Several smaller operators use the same approach with just one or two satellites to provide a regional service. An alternative approach is to use a series of low Earth orbit satellites much closer to Earth. This is the basis of the Iridium and Globalstar satellite phone services.","input":"When did cell phones become common in the us?"},{"output":"Soviet Union","context":"The Race to Berlin was a competition between two Soviet marshals, Georgy Zhukov and Ivan Konev, to be the first to enter Berlin during the final months of World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 1945, with Germany's defeat inevitable, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin set his two marshals in a race to capture Berlin.[1] Although it was mostly their race, each marshal was supported by another front. Marshal Zhukov was protected by Rokossovsky's Second Belorussian Front, while Marshal Konev was supported by Yeremenko's Fourth Ukrainian Front. The two men and their separately commanded armies were pitted against one another, ensuring that they would drive their men as fast and as far as possible to a quick victory. This led to a climax in the bloody Battle of Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviet advance and ultimate capture of the German capital was virtually unopposed by their allies. In an effort to avoid a diplomatic issue, United States Army General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower had ordered his forces into the south of Germany to cut off and wipe out other pieces of the Wehrmacht and to avoid the possibility that the Nazi government would attempt to hold out in a National Redoubt in the Alps. However, the failure of Operation Market Garden in late 1944 may have played a key role in this decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe western Allies' decision to leave eastern Germany and the city of Berlin to the Red Army ÿ honoring the agreement they made with the Soviet Union at Yalta ÿ eventually had serious repercussions as the Cold War emerged and expanded in the post-war era.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Allies agreed at Yalta to specific zones of influence within Germany, the two Soviet armies raced to win control of Berlin, perhaps motivated by a desire to gain control of the German nuclear research program in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute before the Americans.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Allies landed in Normandy, the British and American armies (among affiliated Western Allied forces) had both moved swiftly and decisively to take western cities in France, and to move on to liberate Paris. By September 1944, Allied forces had reached the German border, but the subsequent failure of Operation Market Garden and the ensuing deadlock handed the initiative to Germany for a brief period. In December, Hitler launched a bold but ultimately unsuccessful offensive known as the Battle of the Bulge. In March 1945, the Allies crossed the Rhine in a decisive manner, but the enormous casualties taken by Allied forces in the Ardennes in the previous months and the still significant distance to Berlin dampened Eisenhower's drive to take Berlin before the Soviets.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Eisenhower's Armies were facing resistance that varied from almost non-existent to fanatical[3] as they advanced toward Berlin, which was located 200?km (120?mi) from their positions in early April 1945. Britain's Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, urged Eisenhower to continue the advance toward Berlin by the 21st Army Group, under the command of Field Marshal Montgomery with the intention of capturing the city. Even General George S. Patton agreed with Churchill that he should order the attack on the city since Montgomery's troops could reach Berlin within three days.[4] The British and Americans contemplated an airborne operation before the attack. In Operation Eclipse, the 17th Airborne Division, 82d Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division, and a British brigade were to seize the Tempelhof, Rangdor, Gatow, Staaken, and Oranienburg airfields. In Berlin, the Reichsbanner resistance organization identified possible drop zones for Allied paratroopers and planned to guide them past German defenses into the city.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter General Omar Bradley warned, however, that capturing a city located in a region that the Soviets had already received at the Yalta Conference might cost 100,000 casualties,[5] by April 15 Eisenhower ordered all armies to halt when they reached the Elbe and Mulde Rivers, thus immobilizing these spearheads while the war continued for three more weeks. 21st Army Group was then instead ordered to move northeast toward Bremen and Hamburg. While the U.S. Ninth and First Armies held their ground from Magdeburg through Leipzig to western Czechoslovakia, Eisenhower ordered three Allied field armies (1st French, and the U.S. Seventh and Third Armies) into southeastern Germany and Austria. Advancing from northern Italy, the British Eighth Army[6] pushed to the borders of Yugoslavia to defeat the remaining Wehrmacht elements there.[4] This later caused some friction with the Yugoslav forces, notably around Trieste.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoviet forces took the offensive after the spectacular defeat of Army Group Centre following Operation Bagration in 1944 from which the Wehrmacht forces never recovered. In the winter of 1944 they pushed the German front lines back across Poland, with heavy casualties on both sides. That winter would turn out to be a bloody one, as the fighting came closer to Germany. Stalin had wanted to settle the score since Hitler's breach of their non-aggression pact. Using his Marshals Zhukov and Konev, he was determined to beat Eisenhower to Berlin and the Reichstag. The Soviet Army ultimately captured Berlin. On 15 April 1945, the Soviet Union fired a massive barrage of some one million artillery shells, one of the largest in history, onto the German positions west of the Oder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the devastating attack, Marshal Zhukov's troops advanced towards Berlin only to be ambushed by German soldiers that had withdrawn from their positions in the Oder to the fortified positions of the Seelow Heights further west after receiving intelligence about the expected artillery barrage from a captured Red Army soldier. Zhukovseeing that his plan was not workingdecided to send wave after wave of Soviet soldiers to destroy the German resistance.[7] \\"According to one Russian veteran, Soviet artillery was fired without proper guidance, killing scores of Red Army soldiers.\\"[7] For three days, the attacks still relentlessly came, after the fourth day the 1st Belorussian Front finally broke through the German defensive line, but at a high cost in casualties. This provided the opportunity to advance on Berlin, located 90?km (56?mi) to the west.\\r\\n\\r\\nStalin ordered the 2nd Belorussian Front, commanded by Marshal Rokossovsky, to support Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front to the south.[8] Although Rokossovsky's Front was not chosen to lead the attack at the Seelow Heights, it did benefit Zhukov's Front. It was the actions of Rokossovsky's Front that allowed Zhukov's Front to concentrate on their sector of the front-line while the 2nd Belorussian Front to attack in the lower half of the Oder, between Schwedt and the Baltic Sea coast. This attack on the northern flank of the German Seelow Heights position by the 2nd Belorussian Front helped to reduce resistance on the 1st Belorussian Front sector, and made it possible for the 1st Belorussian Front to emerge victorious at the battle of the Seelow Heights.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Zhukov's Front was fighting the German forces at the Seelow Heights, Marshal Konev and his 1st Ukrainian Front was attacking the remaining German 9th Army that was trapped within pockets in the Spree Forest region near the town of Halbe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 9th Army's first attempt at breaking out of this pocket resulted in the capture of almost 5,000 of its troops, and the loss of 200 guns, mortars and 40 tanks captured by the Red Army. The survivors detected a weakly held sector in the 1st Ukrainian Front's position and attempted a second breakout. A large part of the 9th Army was able to escape through this breach before Konev's staff realized their mistake and sent troops to deal with the unlucky rear guard Germans who were caught in the open by the Red Army. The 9th Army's last attempt to escape resulted in many German deaths, but allowed 25,000 soldiers to escape and regroup with the 12th Army sector of the front. From there, they retreated west toward Elbe, hoping to surrender to the U.S. Army.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral of Army Andrei Yeremenko and his 4th Ukrainian Front was deployed south-west of Marshal Konev's Front, and was ordered by Stalin to continue the offensive against German forces in Saxony to the west.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2nd Ukrainian Front was to attack into Austria, under the command of Marshal Rodion Malinovsky, under the orders of Stalin to deny Hitler the ability to transfer German troops north to defend the Berlin area as the Red Army approached.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the end of Nazi Germany approached, Hitler, still not wanting to give up, issued orders that were impossible for the Germans to execute given the situation. While meeting in his secret bunker under Berlin, Hitler's chief staff members offered personnel to defend the Oder. Commander Hermann G?ring of the Luftwaffe offered 100,000 Luftwaffe men; Heinrich Himmler offered 25,000 SS troopers; and Admiral Doenitz offered 12,000 navy men.[8] However, the new commander of Army Group Vistula, Commander Gotthard Heinrici, who had replaced Himmler, did not agree with the personnel addition and believed that the inexperienced soldiers would be useless and ultimately slaughtered. Goering countered that statement by stating that his Luftwaffe men were \\"bermenschen\\" or superhuman.[8] Hitler ended their argument by telling Heinrici that reinforcements would arrive in time. Heinrici disagreed with Hitler's statement but kept it to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the new commander of Group Vistula, General Heinrici was an excellent defensive tactician in the German Army. He predicted that the main Soviet forces would go through the Oder river and along the main east-west autobahnat the Seelow Heights. Deciding to concentrate his defenses near the Seelow Heights, he deployed a small number of units, enough to screen the Oder river, as the opening defenses while making three defensive lines behind the Seelow Heights, where a large amount of his forces were concentrated. These lines spread all the way to Berlin where the last linethe Wotem linewas almost 10ÿ15?mi (16ÿ24?km) behind the front defenses. However, even though the Red Army broke through the defenses, it did buy Hitler time to try to reorganize the final defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nZhukov's Front entered Berlin from the north then expanded north-west from the Oder River. Konev's Front had chosen the southern areas of Berlin to enter from. Both Fronts continued to expand north-west in an attempt to complete a pincer movement or in other words, they were trying to encircle Berlin. On 23 April 1945, Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front finally linked up with members of Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front, thereby ending any hope for the Germans to escape.[9]","input":"What allied nation was the first to reach the german capitol of berlin?"},{"output":"the late 10th century AD","context":"The Norse colonization of North America began in the late 10th century AD when Norsemen explored and settled areas of the North Atlantic including the northeastern fringes of North America.[1] Viking houses were found at LAnse aux Meadows near the northern tip of Newfoundland in 1960. This discovery aided the reignition of archaeological exploration for the Vikings in the North Atlantic.[2]\\r\\nThe Norse colony in Greenland lasted for almost 500 years. Continental North American settlements were small and did not develop into permanent colonies. While voyages, for example to collect timber, are likely to have occurred for some time, there is no evidence of any lasting Norse settlements on mainland North America.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Sagas of Icelanders, Norsemen from Iceland first settled Greenland in the 980s. There is no special reason to doubt the authority of the information that the sagas supply regarding the very beginning of the settlement, but they cannot be treated as primary evidence for the history of Norse Greenland because they embody the literary preoccupations of writers and audiences in medieval Iceland that are not always reliable.[4]\\r\\nErik the Red (Old Norse: Eirkr rauei), having been banished from Iceland for manslaughter, explored the uninhabited southwestern coast of Greenland during the three years of his banishment.[5][6] He made plans to entice settlers to the area, naming it Greenland on the assumption that \\"people would be more eager to go there because the land had a good name\\".[7] The inner reaches of one long fjord, named Eiriksfjord after him, was where he eventually established his estate Brattahlid. He issued tracts of land to his followers.[8]\\r\\nAt its peak the colony consisted of two settlements. The Eastern was at the southwestern tip of Greenland, while the Western Settlement was about 500?km up the west coast, inland from present-day Nuuk. A smaller settlement near the Eastern Settlement is sometimes considered the Middle Settlement. The combined population was around 2,000ÿ3,000.[9] At least 400 farms have been identified by archaeologists.[8] Norse Greenland had a bishopric (at Garear) and exported walrus ivory, furs, rope, sheep, whale or seal blubber, live animals such as polar bears, supposed \\"unicorn horns\\" (in reality narwhal tusks), and cattle hides. In 1126, the population requested a Bishop (headquartered at Garear), and in 1261, they accepted the overlordship of the Norwegian King. They continued to have their own law and became almost completely independent after 1349, the time of the Black Death. In 1380, the Norwegian Kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark.[10]\\r\\nThere is evidence of Norse trade with the natives (called Skraelings by the Vikings). The Norse would have encountered both Native Americans (the Beothuk, related to the Algonquin) and the Thule, the ancestors of the Inuit. The Dorset had withdrawn from Greenland before the Norse settlement of the island. Items such as comb fragments, pieces of iron cooking utensils and chisels, chess pieces, ship rivets, carpenter's planes, and oaken ship fragments used in Inuit boats have been found far beyond the traditional range of Norse colonization. A small ivory statue that appears to represent a European has also been found among the ruins of an Inuit community house.[10]\\r\\nThe colony began to decline in the 14th century. The Western Settlement was abandoned around 1350, and the last bishop at Garear died in 1377.[10] After a marriage was recorded in 1408, no written records mention the settlers. It is probable that the Eastern Settlement was defunct by the late 15th century. The most recent radiocarbon date found in Norse settlements as of 2002 was 1430 (I15 years). Several theories have been advanced to explain the decline.\\r\\nThe Little Ice Age of this period would have made travel between Greenland and Europe, as well as farming, more difficult; although fishing and seal hunting provided a healthy diet, there was more prestige in cattle farming, and there was increased availability of farms in Scandinavian countries depopulated by famine and plague epidemics. In addition, Greenlandic ivory may have been supplanted in European markets by cheaper ivory from Africa.[11] Despite the loss of contact with the Greenlanders, the Norwegian-Danish crown continued to consider Greenland a possession.\\r\\nNot knowing whether the old Norse civilization remained in Greenland or notand worried that if it did, it would still be Catholic 200 years after the Scandinavian homelands had experienced the Reformationa joint merchant-clerical expedition led by the Dano-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede was sent to Greenland in 1721. Though this expedition found no surviving Europeans, it marked the beginning of Denmark's re-assertion of sovereignty over the island.\\r\\nNorse Greenlanders were limited to scattered fjords on the island that provided a spot for their animals (such as cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, and cats) to be kept and farms to be established.[12][13] In these fjords, the farms depended upon byres to host their livestock in the winter, and routinely participated in the culling of their herds in order to survive the season.[12][13][14] The coming warmer seasons meant that livestocks were taken from their byres to pasture, the most fertile being controlled by the most powerful farms and the church.[13][14][15] What was produced by livestock and farming was supplemented with subsistence hunting of mainly seal and caribou as well as walrus for trade.[12][13][14] The Norse mainly relied on the Nordrsetur hunt, a communal hunt of migratory harp seals that would take place during spring.[12][15] Trade was highly important to the Greenland Norse and they relied on imports of lumber due to the barrenness of Greenland. In turn they exported goods such as walrus ivory and hide, live polar bears, and narwhal tusks.[14][15] Ultimately these setups were vulnerable as they relied on migratory patterns created by climate as well as the well-being of the few fjords on the island.[13][15]\\r\\nA portion of the time the Greenland settlements existed was during The Little Ice Age and the climate was, overall, becoming cooler and more humid.[12][13][14] As climate began to cool and humidity began to increase, this brought longer winters and shorter springs, more storms and affected the migratory patterns of the harp seal.[12][13][14][15] Pasture space began to dwindle and fodder yields for the winter became much smaller. This combined with regular herd culling made it hard to maintain livestock, especially for the poorest of the Greenland Norse.[12] In spring, the voyages to where migratory harp seals could be found became more dangerous due to more frequent storms, and the lower population of harp seals meant that Nordrsetur hunts became less successful, making subsistence hunting extremely difficult.[12][13] The strain on resources made trade difficult, and as time went on, Greenland exports lost value in the European market due to competing countries and the lack of interest in what was being traded.[15]\\r\\nIn addition, it seemed that the Norse were unwilling to integrate with the indigenous Thule of Greenland, either through marriage or culture. There is evidence of contact as seen through the Thule archaeological record including ivory depictions of the Norse as well as bronze and steel artifacts. However, there is essentially no material evidence of the Thule among Norse artifacts.[12][13] In older research it was posited that it was not climate change alone that lead to Norse decline, but also their unwillingness to adapt.[12] For example, if the Norse had decided to focus their subsistence hunting on the ringed seal (which could be hunted year round, though individually), and decided to reduce or do away with their communal hunts, food would have been much less scarce during the winter season.[13][14][15][16] Also, had Norse individuals used skin instead of wool to produce their clothing, they would have been able to fare better nearer to the coast, and wouldn't have been as confined to the fjords.[13][14][15] However, more recent research has shown that the Norse did try to adapt in their own ways.[17] Some of these attempts included increased subsistence hunting. A significant number of bones of marine animals can be found at the settlements, suggesting increased hunting with the absence of farmed food.[17] In addition, pollen records show that the Norse didn't devastate the small forests and foliage as previously thought. Instead the Norse ensured that overgrazed or overused sections were given time to regrow and moved to other areas.[17] Norse farmers also attempted to adapt. With the increased need for winter fodder and smaller pastures, they would self-fertilize their lands in an attempt to keep up with the new demands caused by the changing climate.[17] However, even with these attempts, climate change was not the only thing putting pressure on the Greenland Norse. The economy was changing, and the exports they relied on were losing value.[15] Current research suggests that the Norse were unable to maintain their colonies because of economic and climatic change happening at the same time.[17][18]\\r\\nAccording to the Icelandic sagasEirik the Red's Saga,[19] Saga of the Greenlanders, plus chapters of the Hauksb܇k and the Flatey Bookthe Norse started to explore lands to the west of Greenland only a few years after the Greenland settlements were established. In 985 while sailing from Iceland to Greenland with a migration fleet consisting of 400ÿ700 settlers[8][20] and 25 other ships (14 of which completed the journey), a merchant named Bjarni Herj܇lfsson was blown off course, and after three days' sailing he sighted land west of the fleet. Bjarni was only interested in finding his father's farm, but he described his discovery to Leif Erikson who explored the area in more detail and planted a small settlement fifteen years later.[8]\\r\\nThe sagas describe three separate areas discovered during this exploration: Helluland, which means \\"land of the flat stones\\"; Markland, \\"the land of forests\\", definitely of interest to settlers in Greenland where there were few trees; and Vinland, \\"the land of wine\\", found somewhere south of Markland. It was in Vinland that the settlement described in the sagas was founded.\\r\\nThree of Erik the Red's children visited the North American continent: his sons Leif and Thorvald, and their sister (or half-sister) Freydis. Thorvald died there.\\r\\nUsing the routes, landmarks, currents, rocks, and winds that Bjarni had described to him, Leif sailed from Greenland westward across the Labrador Sea, with a crew of 35sailing the same knarr Bjarni had used to make the voyage. He described Helluland as \\"level and wooded, with broad white beaches wherever they went and a gently sloping shoreline.\\"[8] Leif and others had wanted his father, Erik the Red, to lead this expedition and talked him into it. However, as Erik attempted to join his son Leif on the voyage towards these new lands, he fell off his horse as it slipped on the wet rocks near the shore; thus he was injured and stayed behind.[8]\\r\\nLeif wintered in 1001, probably near Cape Bauld on the northern tip of Newfoundland, where one day his foster father Tyrker was found drunk, on what the saga describes as \\"wine-berries.\\" Squashberries, gooseberries, and cranberries all grew wild in the area. There are varying explanations for Leif apparently describing fermented berries as \\"wine.\\"\\r\\nLeif spent another winter at \\"Leifsb~eir\\" without conflict, and sailed back to Brattahle in Greenland to assume filial duties to his father.\\r\\nIn 1004, Leif's brother Thorvald Eiriksson sailed with a crew of 30 men to Vinland and spent the following winter at Leif's camp. In the spring, Thorvald attacked nine of the local people who were sleeping under three skin-covered canoes. The ninth victim escaped and soon came back to the Norse camp with a force. Thorvald was killed by an arrow that succeeded in passing through the barricade. Although brief hostilities ensued, the Norse explorers stayed another winter and left the following spring. Subsequently, another of Leif's brothers, Thorstein, sailed to the New World to retrieve his dead brother's body, but he died before leaving Greenland.[8]\\r\\nIn 1009 Thorfinn Karlsefni, also known as \\"Thorfinn the Valiant\\", supplied three ships with livestock and 160 men and women[20] (although another source sets the number of settlers at 250). After a cruel winter, he headed south and landed at Straumfjord. He later moved to Straums?y, possibly because the current was stronger there. A sign of peaceful relations between the indigenous peoples and the Norsemen is noted here. The two sides bartered with furs and gray squirrel skins for milk and red cloth, which the natives tied around their heads as a sort of headdress.\\r\\nThere are conflicting stories but one account states that a bull belonging to Karlsefni came storming out of the wood, so frightening the natives that they ran to their skin-boats and rowed away. They returned three days later, in force. The natives used catapults, hoisting \\"a large sphere on a pole; it was dark blue in color\\" and about the size of a sheep's belly,[21] which flew over the heads of the men and made an ugly din.[21]\\r\\nThe Norsemen retreated. Leif Erikson's half-sister Freyds Eirksd܇ttir was pregnant and unable to keep up with the retreating Norsemen. She called out to them to stop fleeing from \\"such pitiful wretches\\", adding that if she had weapons, she could do better than that. Freyds seized the sword belonging to a man who had been killed by the natives. She pulled one of her breasts out of her bodice and struck it with the sword, frightening the natives, who fled.[21]\\r\\nPurported runestones have been found in North America, most famously the Kensington Runestone. These are generally considered to be hoaxes or misinterpretations of Native American petroglyphs.[22]\\r\\nThere are many claims of Norse colonization in New England, none well-founded.\\r\\nMonuments claimed to be Norse include:[23]\\r\\nThe nineteenth-century Harvard chemist Eben Norton Horsford connected the Charles River Basin to places described in the Norse sagas and elsewhere, notably Norumbega.[24] He published several books on the topic and had plaques, monuments, and statues erected in honor of the Norse.[25] His work received little support from mainstream historians and archeologists at the time, and even less today.[26][27][28]\\r\\nSettlements in continental North America aimed to exploit natural resources such as furs and in particular lumber, which was in short supply in Greenland.[29] It is unclear why the short-term settlements did not become permanent, though it was likely in part because of hostile relations with the indigenous peoples, referred to as Skr?lings by the Norse.[30] Nevertheless, it appears that sporadic voyages to Markland for forages, timber, and trade with the locals could have lasted as long as 400 years.[31][32]\\r\\nEvidence of continuing trips includes the Maine Penny, a Norwegian coin from King Olaf Kyrre's reign (1067ÿ1093) allegedly found in a Native American archaeological site in the U.S. state of Maine, suggesting an exchange between the Norse and the Native Americans late in or after the 11th century; and an entry in the Icelandic Annals from 1347 which refers to a small Greenlandic vessel with a crew of eighteen that arrived in Iceland while attempting to return to Greenland from Markland with a load of timber.[33]\\r\\nFor centuries it remained unclear whether the Icelandic stories represented real voyages by the Norse to North America. The sagas first gained serious historic respectability when, in 1837, the Danish antiquarian Carl Christian Rafn pointed out the possibility for a Norse settlement in, or voyages to, North America. North America, by the name Winland, first appeared in written sources in a work by Adam of Bremen from approximately 1075. The most important works about North America and the early Norse activities there, namely the Sagas of Icelanders, first reached written form only in the 13th and 14th centuries.[citation needed]\\r\\nEvidence of Norse west of Greenland came in the 1960s when archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad and her husband, outdoorsman and author Helge Ingstad, excavated a Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland. The location of the various lands described in the sagas remains unclear, however. Many historians identify Helluland with Baffin Island and Markland with Labrador. The location of Vinland poses a thornier question. Most believe that the L'Anse aux Meadows settlement represents the Vinland settlement described in the sagas; others argue that the sagas depict Vinland as warmer than Newfoundland and therefore lying farther south.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2012 Canadian researchers identified possible signs of Norse outposts in Nanook at Tanfield Valley on Baffin Island, as well as on Nunguvik, Willows Island and Avayalik.[34][35][36] Unusual fabric cordage found on Baffin Island in the 1980s and stored at the Canadian Museum of Civilization was identified in 1999 as possibly of Norse manufacture; that discovery led to more in-depth exploration of the Tanfield Valley archaeological site.[citation needed]\\r\\nArcheological findings in 2015 at Point Rosee, on the southwest coast of Newfoundland, were originally thought to reveal evidence of a turf wall and the roasting of bog iron ore, and therefore a possible second 10th century Viking settlement in Canada.[37] Findings from the 2016 excavation suggest the turf wall and the roasted bog iron ore discovered in 2015 were the result of natural processes.[38] The possible settlement was initially discovered through satellite imagery in 2014,[39] and archaeologists excavated the area in 2015 and 2016.[40][41] Birgitta Linderoth Wallace, one of the leading experts of Viking archaeology in North America and an expert on the Viking settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows, is unsure of the identification of Point Rosee as a Norse site.[42] Archaeologist Karen Milek was a member of the 2016 Point Rosee excavation and is a Norse expert. She also expressed doubt that Point Rosee was a Norse site as there are no good landing sites for their boats and there are steep cliffs between the shoreline and the excavation site.[43]\\r\\nThe Sklholt Map, made by an Icelandic teacher in 1570, depicts part of north-eastern North America mentioning Helluland, Markland and Vinland.[44]","input":"When did the vikings first come to north america?"},{"output":"4,737,270","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenix Metropolitan Area ÿ often referred to as the Valley of the Sun, the Salt River Valley or Metro Phoenix ÿ is a metropolitan area, centered on the city of Phoenix, that includes much of the central part of the U.S. State of Arizona.

The core part of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area is the PhoenixÿMesa, Arizona Urban Area, which is far smaller than the Metropolitan Statistical Area.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaces that fall completely or partially within the boundaries of the Phoenix-Mesa, AZ UA are in bold below.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal city\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaces with 250,000+ inhabitants\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaces with 150,000ÿ249,999 inhabitants\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaces with 75,000 to 149,999 inhabitants\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaces with 30,000 to 74,999 inhabitants\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaces with 10,000ÿ29,999 inhabitants\\r\\n\\r\\nFewer than 10,000 inhabitants\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 10,000 inhabitants\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder 10,000 inhabitants\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2010, the Phoenix Metropolitan area consists of Maricopa and Pinal counties, comprising a total area of about 14,600 square miles. Because of the size of counties in Arizona, even though Maricopa and Pinal counties together contain nearly 4.5 million people, most of the area is uninhabited, which gives the MSA an extremely low density compared to other major MSAs in the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average elevation is about 2,000 feet (610?m), with the highest point being 2,704 feet (824?m).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenix Metropolitan area is notable for its warm, desert climate. On average, the area receives about 9 inches of rain annually, with less than 1 inch of snow every decade. In total, the region will see about 32 days of measurable precipitation each year. The MSA is one of the sunniest major metropolitan areas, receiving 295 days of sunshine, compared to the national average of 205. The average July high is about 104?F (40?C), with the average January low being about 37?F (3?C), still above freezing. Bestplaces gives the Phoenix Metropolitan Area a comfort index[a] of 44/100, which is also the national average.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow is a chart showing climate data collected from Sky Harbor Airport. Note that due to the vast area covered by the MSA, climates differ throughout the valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenix Metropolitan area has historically been the center of the state's economy. As with the state of Arizona, the area relied on the 5 C's (copper, cattle, climate, citrus, and cotton) for its economic growth and expansion. However, after World War II, the area entered the manufacturing industry, which spurred the growth of what would eventually be one of the largest urban areas in the nation. Currently, the two largest industries are manufacturing and tourism. About 10 million people visit from other States and Canada each year, due to the area's mild winters and long, sunny days. The technology and service industries currently account for almost 77% of total employment in the region.[15] As well as a strong tourism industry, the Phoenix area has a significant business sector. Several Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies have their international headquarters in the area, including Avnet, PetSmart, Insight Technologies, Apollo Education Group, and Sprouts Farmers Market. Other Fortune 500 companies with significant presence include Banner Health, the state's largest private employer, American Airlines, which merged with Tempe-based US Airways, American Express, Wells Fargo, Boeing, and Intel, which has a large regional campus in Chandler.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Metropolitan Area ranks 5th in the nation in economic growth, which is a major comeback from the recession.[17] The unemployment rate of the area is 5.3%, lower than the national rate of 6.3%. It also has slightly higher recent job growth (1.99% compared to 1.18%) and higher projected job growth (38.7% compared to 36.1%). Although the area has significantly higher sales tax rates compared with the nation as a whole (8.3% to 6%), income tax rates are lower than the national average (3.36% to 4.72%). The largest occupation by population is in the office/administrative sector, comprising more than a quarter of all jobs in the region.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenix Metropolitan Area is served by several controlled-access freeways, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nMany new freeways are planned to be built in the future, either through upgrades of existing roads such as SR 74, SR 85, and Northern Parkway; or through the construction of new freeways where no road existed before such as SR 24, SR 30, I-11, and the South Mountain Freeway portion of Loop 202.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the arterial roads in the Phoenix metropolitan area are laid out on a regular grid, following the section lines established in the Public Land Survey System. As a result, arterial roads in cities that had once been geographically separate may have been given different names while occupying the same section line. When these roads were extended to accommodate the growth in the area they eventually merged into a single road while the previous segments retained their existing names. This results in several cases of a road abruptly changing names; for example, Dunlap Avenue in Phoenix becomes Olive Avenue west of 43rd Avenue, in Glendale.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother quirk of a grid system based upon the Public Land Survey System is due to the occasional corrections in the grid caused by the curvature of the earth. This results in arterial roadways deviating slightly from a straight line, as can be seen in many locations where roads abruptly curve either just north or just south of Baseline Road to follow a new section line.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of the cities in the metropolitan area, as well as unincorporated areas in Maricopa County, observe the addressing system employed by the City of Phoenix. A number of cities, however, retain their own addressing systems with differing reference points, creating the potential for multiple instances of a house number being found on the same named road.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of numbering systems, some roads that continue through multiple cities will switch numbering conventions several times. A drive eastward along Broadway Road, for example, will pass through Goodyear, Avondale, Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa, and Apache Junction, each with their own reference point for address numbering. Though the street does not curve, the direction changes from west to east in each city and back again when moving from one city to the next, causing considerable overlap in numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\n[19][20]\\r\\nMost communities in Maricopa County use the Phoenix-County numbering system, with the point of origin at Central Avenue and Washington Street. In the Phoenix-County system, north-south numbered roads labeled \\"avenue\\", \\"drive\\", and \\"lane\\" are located West of Central Avenue, while those labeled \\"street\\", \\"place\\" and \\"way\\" are located east of Central Avenue. Starting with 579th Avenue[21] in the west near Tonopah the avenues count down with approximately 8 numbers per mile to 19th Avenue and count up again to from 16th Street to 228th Street[22] near Queen Creek in the east. They go, in order from west to east (although not all necessarily exist):\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has been a source of confusion for some newcomers, who might end up, for example, at 91st Avenue and Thunderbird Road, when in fact they intended to go to 91st Street and Thunderbird Road, between 30?minutes and an hour away from one another depending on traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne beneficial quality of this arrangement for unfamiliar travelers is that the major north-south arterial roads are rarely similarly named; the \\"avenue\\" arterials in the West Valley are all odd-numbered and the \\"street\\" arterials in the East Valley are even-numbered, with the exception of 7th Ave. & 7th St., both being major roadways running parallel and each one-half mile from Central Ave.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunities in Maricopa County that have their own street numbering systems include:\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional confusion can be encountered in Mesa in its urban core, with east-west numbered avenues and drives counting down from 11th Avenue north towards Main Street),[23] and numbered streets and places counting down from 11th Place south towards Main Street.[24]  Then, in the eastern part of the city, north-south streets and places count up from 22nd St east of Gilbert Rd,[25] to 112th Street on the Apache Junction border.[26]  Also, numerous trailer parks inside the city limits run their own contradictory variations of the numbered street system.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost communities in Pinal County use the Pinal County street numbering system, whose point of origin is at SR 287 and 11?Mile Corner Road (the intersection of which is known as \\"11 Mile Corner\\"). Exceptions include:\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that Apache Junction continues Mesa's convention of numbered street names by having the north-south sequence continue up from 112th St while simultaneously having east-west numbered avenues south of Apache Trail and east-west numbered streets north of Apache Trail.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn term of safety, the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ metropolitan area has been ranked 16th most dangerous in the USA, base on its Pedestrian Danger Index, computed on the share of local commuters who walk to work and the most recent data on pedestrian deaths as found in a 2016 report released by Smart Growth America[29].\\r\\n\\r\\nAmtrak's Los Angeles-New Orleans Sunset Limited served Phoenix from 1971 until it was rerouted on June 2, 1996, to a more southerly route between Tucson and Yuma, Arizona, in order to accommodate the Union Pacific Railroad's desire to abandon a portion of its Phoenix-to-Yuma \\"West Line.\\" This made Phoenix one of the largest cities in the nation without direct passenger service. The designated Phoenix-area stop is in Maricopa, about 40 miles south of downtown Phoenix.\\r\\n\\r\\nA light rail system (dubbed the \\"METRO Light Rail,\\" or \\"Worm\\") runs more than 20?miles from suburban Mesa, through Tempe and into Phoenix, traveling through the downtown area, offering access to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and linking two of the four metro area campuses of Arizona State University. The light rail began public operation on December 27, 2008, and it was projected to initially accommodate 26,000 boardings a day, or more than 8?million boardings in its first year.  The Valley Metro Rail boardings has experienced constant growth since the beginning.  In the year 2012, the light rail boarded just over 14 million people.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany expansions to the METRO system are currently in the early planning stages, and two are under construction. The Central Mesa extension project, which extends the Main Street line 2? miles from its current terminus at Sycamore to Mesa Drive in Downtown Mesa, has finished construction and opened on August 22, 2015.[30] The Northwest rail project opened March 2016. The project extended the 19th Avenue track from its former terminus at Montebello Ave to Dunlap Avenue, 3 miles north.[31] Many more extensions are funded, with further projects being studied for feasibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport was the 24th busiest passenger facility in the world and the 10th busiest in the United States, with more than 38?million passengers using the facility. With three terminal buildings encompassing 120 gates, more than 20 airlines offer daily non-stop flights to destinations throughout the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport started commercial passenger flights in 2004. The airport currently provides service to 39 destinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several municipal and regional airports in the metropolitan area; however, none of them are currently used by commercial airlines for passenger flights. They include, but are not limited to, Glendale Airport, Phoenix Deer Valley Airport, Phoenix Goodyear Airport, Scottsdale Airport, Falcon Field, Chandler Airport, Buckeye Airport, Phoenix Regional Airport, Pleasant Valley Airport, Estrella Sailport, Stellar Airpark, Skyranch at Carefree, Gila River Memorial Airport, Pegasus Airpark.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges in house prices for the area are publicly tracked on a regular basis using the CaseÿShiller index; the statistic is published by Standard & Poor's and is also a component of S&P's 20-city composite index of the value of the U.S. residential real estate market.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 3310N 11202W? / ?33.17N 112.04W? / 33.17; -112.04","input":"What is the current population of phoenix arizona?"},{"output":"Put the Blame on Me","context":"\\"chame la Culpa\\" (American Spanish:?[?e?ame la ?kulpa]; English: \\"Put the Blame on Me\\") is a song recorded by Puerto Rican singer and songwriter Luis Fonsi and American singer and songwriter Demi Lovato.

Founded in 2008, the team plays its home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. After serving a two-year suspension along with rajasthan royals from the IPL starting July 2015 for the alleged involvement of their owners in the 2013 IPL betting case, the Super Kings returned to the league in 2018.[2] The team is captained by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coached by Stephen Fleming. It won its comeback season by winning its 3rd season and also becoming the team which has won the most number of IPL with MI. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Super Kings have lifted the IPL title thrice (in 2010, 2011 and 2018), and have the best win percentage among all teams in the IPL (61.56).[3] They hold the records of most appearances in the IPL playoffs (nine) and in the final (seven). In addition, they have also won the Champions League Twenty20 in 2010 and 2014. The brand value of the Super Kings in 2018 was estimated at $65 million, making them the most valuable franchise in the IPL.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.[5] In January 2008, the BCCI unveiled the owners of eight city-based franchises. The Chennai franchise was sold to the India Cements for $91 million, making it the fourth most expensive team in the league behind Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad.[6] India Cements acquired the rights to the franchise for 10 years. Former ICC Chairman N. Srinivasan was the de facto owner of the Chennai Super Kings, by means of his position as the vice-chairman and managing director of India Cements Ltd. The franchisee was transferred to a separate entity named Chennai Super Kings Cricket Ltd., after the Supreme Court of India struck down the controversial amendment to the BCCI constitution's clause 6.2.4 that allowed board officials to have a commercial interest in the IPL and the Champions League T20 on January 22, 2015.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first player auctions for the inaugural IPL season conducted in January 2008, the Chennai franchise bought a number of contemporary star cricketers such as Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Matthew Hayden, Stephen Fleming, Muttiah Muralitharan and Michael Hussey.[8] Dhoni became the costliest player of the auction, as the Chennai franchise bought him for $1.5 million.[9] The franchise named Dhoni as the captain of the team and appointed Kepler Wessels as the head coach.[10] They played their first game on April 19, 2008 against Kings XI Punjab at Mohali. The Super Kings won the game by 33 runs after posting 240/5 in 20 overs, which was the highest total of the tournament, a record surpassed by themselves in 2010.[11] The Super Kings ended the league stage with eight wins from 14 games and finished third on the points table.[12] They beat the Kings XI Punjab by 9 wickets in the semifinal.[13] The Super Kings faced the Rajasthan Royals in the final of the IPL at Mumbai. Batting first, the Super Kings scored 163/5 in 20 overs and lost the game by 3 wickets off the final delivery of the match.[14] They also earned a spot in the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 along with Rajasthan, but the tournament was cancelled due to the 2008 Mumbai Attacks and the Super Kings, along with Rajasthan, received $5 million each as compensation.[15] Fleming, who had decided to retire from all forms of the game after the first season of the IPL, took over as the coach of the Super Kings team from Wessels for the next season which was to be held in South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2009 season, the Super Kings bought English all-rounder Andrew Flintoff for $1.55?million at the auction making him the highest-paid IPL cricketer along with English teammate Kevin Pietersen who was bought for the same amount by Royal Challengers Bangalore.[16] However, Flintoff played only 3 matches for them before suffering a knee injury that ruled him out of the season. The Super Kings were also without the services of Hussey who had decided to skip the IPL season to focus on The Ashes.[17] The Super Kings finished with 17 points from 14 matches and earned a second place at the league table.[18] However, at the semi-finals, their hopes of entering the final for a second time were crushed by the Royal Challengers who beat them by 6 wickets.[19] The Super Kings opener Matthew Hayden, who scored 572 runs in 12 innings with 5 half-centuries at an average of 52 and strike-rate of 145, won the Orange Cap for the leading run-scorer of the season[20] and was also adjudged Player of the Tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the Super Kings struggled in the first half of the regular season, winning only two matches out of seven. They won four of their next five games in the season mainly due to the efforts of Murali Vijay and Suresh Raina. After a defeat at home to the Delhi Daredevils, the Super Kings were left with a must-win match against Kings XI Punjab at Dharamshala. The Super Kings won the match by six wickets as they chased down the target of 193 with two balls to spare with skipper Dhoni scoring an unbeaten 54 from 29 balls.[21] Thus, with seven wins from 14 matches, Chennai finished with the same number of points as three other teams with two semi-final spots at stake. Chennai got the third place as they had the better net run rate of the four teams which finished on 14 points.[22] In the semifinal, the Super Kings scored a modest 142/7 in 20 overs against the defending champions Deccan Chargers. But an inspired bowling spell from Doug Bollinger (4/13 in four overs) did the most damage as the Chargers were bowled out for 104. This gave the Super Kings a 38-run victory that took them to the final.[23] The Super Kings faced the tournament favorites Mumbai Indians at their home ground in the final.[24] Suresh Raina's 57 (35) helped the Super Kings recover from 68/3 after 12 overs to put up 168/5 at the end of their 20 overs. Then, their spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Muralitharan conceded only 41 runs in the 8 overs bowled between them to help the Super Kings won the game by 22 runs and secure their first ever IPL title.[25] With this, the Super Kings also qualified for the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 that was held in South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Champions League, the Super Kings were placed in Group A along with champions of Twenty20 competitions from Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. The Super Kings topped the Group table with three wins and a Super Over defeat to the Victorian Bushrangers.[26] In the semi-final at Durban, the Super Kings comprehensively defeated IPL rivals Royal Challengers Bangalore by 52 runs. Raina won the Man of the match for his unbeaten 94 off 48 balls.[27] The Super Kings played their first CLT20 final at Johannesburg where they beat the Chevrolet Warriors by 8 wickets, becoming the first IPL team to win the CLT20.[28] Murali Vijay won not only the Man of the Match in the final for his 58 but also the Golden Bat for scoring the most runs in the tournament and Ashwin, who was the leading wicket-taker, was adjudged the Player of the Series. At the end of the season, Matthew Hayden decided to retire from the IPL.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, as two new teams were added to the IPL, the IPL Governing Council declared that each franchise could retain a maximum of four players of their squad, only three of whom can be Indian players, and the rest of the international players would be put in the mega-auction. The Chennai franchise, keen to have the same set of core players, retained captain MS Dhoni, vice-captain Suresh Raina, Murali Vijay and all-rounder Albie Morkel for a total of $4.5 million. The retention left them with the power of spending only $4.5 million at the mega-auction. At the auction, they bought back some of their star players of previous seasons such as Hussey, Ashwin, Bollinger and Subramaniam Badrinath. In the 2011 IPL, they lost three of their first five games which placed them at the bottom of the ten-team points table.[29] But then, they went on to win seven of their next eight games to finish second and register a spot in the knockout stages. They faced the top-ranked team Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Qualifying final which they won by 6 wickets thanks to an unbeaten 73 from Suresh Raina.[30] In the final, they faced the same opponents again, which was held at their home ground Chepauk. Vijay and Hussey put on a 133-run first-wicket partnership that helped the Super Kings to post a total of 205/5. Their bowlers, then, restricted Bangalore to only 147 to take the Super Kings to second consecutive title in the IPL. Vijay was awarded Man of the Match for his match-winning innings of 95.[31] CSK also won all their home games that season becoming the first team in IPL to achieve the feat. However at the Champions League later that year, they won only one out of their four group matches and finished at the bottom.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, the franchise signed up Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja for $2 million at the players' auction.[33] They got off to a rather slow start in the regular season, winning only five of their first 12 games which put them in doubt of qualifying for the Playoffs. Then they won three of their last four matches and qualified for the Playoffs with a better net run rate than the Royal Challengers who also finished with the same number of points.[34] In the Eliminator, they beat the Mumbai Indians by 38 runs before comprehensively beating the table-toppers Delhi Daredevils in the Qualifying final by 86 runs. Murali Vijay, who struck his second IPL hundred (113 off 58 balls), won the Man of the Match.[35] At the final, the Super Kings were defeated by 5 wickets by the Kolkata Knight Riders who chased down the target of 191 with two balls to spare, thus denying the Super Kings a hat-trick of titles in the IPL.[36] At the Champions League, once again they could not progress past the group stage with two wins and two defeats.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, the Super Kings strengthened their bowling attack by signing up five overseas and five Indian bowlers.[38] In the IPL season, they finished first in the points table with 11 wins from 16 matches and qualified for the Playoffs and 2013 CLT20.[39] This was the first time in six seasons that the Super Kings had topped the league table of the IPL. During the season, they also equaled Royal Challengers Bangalore's 2011 record for most wins in succession in the IPL (7 wins on trot).[40] In the first Qualifier at Delhi against Mumbai Indians, the Super Kings posted 192/1 in 20 overs riding on unbeaten half-centuries from Hussey (86* off 58 balls) and Raina (82* off 42 balls) before bowling out their opponents for 144.[41] Thus they entered the final of the IPL for the fourth time in succession where they would play the same opponents, Mumbai Indians, at Kolkata. At the final, batting first, the Mumbai Indians made 148/9 in their 20 overs. In reply, the Super Kings were reduced to 39/6 at one stage before an unbeaten half-century from skipper Dhoni took them close to the target. However, Mumbai Indians won the match by 23 runs to win their first ever IPL title.[42] Super Kings opening batsman Michael Hussey, who scored 733 runs that season at an average of 52, won the Orange Cap for the most runs in the season while all-rounder Dwayne Bravo won the Purple Cap for bagging the most wickets (32).[43] The Super Kings gained direct qualification for the 2013 CLT20 which was held in India in SeptemberÿOctober. They were placed in Group B alongside Brisbane Heat, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Titans and Trinidad & Tobago. They won their first three games before losing the final group match against Trinidad & Tobago. With 12 points from four matches,[44] the Super Kings progressed to the semifinals where they suffered a 14-run defeat at the hands of the Rajasthan Royals at Jaipur.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, before the players' mega-auction, Chennai retained Dhoni, Raina, Jadeja, Ashwin and Bravo. The retention left them with a purse of ?21 crores to spend at the auction. At the auction, the franchise bought the likes of Brendon McCullum, Dwayne Smith, Faf du Plessis, Ashish Nehra, Mohit Sharma among others. The first phase of the IPL season, as it coincided with the general elections, was held in UAE. The second phase returned to India, but the Super Kings' home matches were shifted from Chennai, due to \\"a deadlock between stadium authorities and the state administration\\", to JSCA International Stadium in Ranchi.[46][47] The Super Kings started the season with a defeat in the opening match, after which they went on to win eight of their next nine matches to take the first spot in the points table. However, they suffered a loss of form towards the end of the regular season which resulted in three consecutive defeats.[48] They won their last league fixture and finished third in the points table and qualified for the Eliminator against the fourth-placed Mumbai Indians. They won the Eliminator at Mumbai by 7 wickets and qualified for the Qualifier. At the Qualifier against Kings XI Punjab, the Super Kings won the toss and elected to field. Punjab went on to score 226/6 in their 20 overs. The Super Kings, in reply, could manage only 202/7 despite a 25-ball 87 from Raina.[49] They crashed out of the IPL, but, on account of finishing third, qualified for the main event of the 2014 CLT20. In the group stage of the CLT20, the Super Kings won two matches, lost one while another match was a no result. Thus with 10 points they finished second in the group table[50] and qualified for the semifinal where they met the unbeaten team of the other group, Kings XI Punjab. After being put in to bat, the Super Kings posted 182/7 in 20 overs thanks to Bravo who scored a 39-ball 67. Then their bowlers reduced Punjab to 34/6 in the eighth over, and Punjab were eventually bowled out for 117.[51] At the final in Bangalore, the Super Kings faced the IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders who set them a target of 181 in 20 overs. Raina guided the run-chase with an unbeaten 109 off 62 balls, helping the team to an eight-wicket win and their second CLT20 title.[52] Super Kings spinner Pawan Negi who took 5/22 during Kolkata's innings won the Man of the Match, and Raina, who finished as the highest run-getter of the tournament, was awarded Man of the Tournament.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, before the players' auction, Chennai Super Kings gave away Ben Hilfenhaus, John Hastings, Vijay Shankar and David Hussey. At the auction they bought back Michael Hussey for a price of Rs.1.5 crores. They also bought Kyle Abbott, Irfan Pathan, Andrew Tye, Eklavya Dwivedi, Ankush Bains, Pratyush Singh and Rahul Sharma. In the final, they lost against Mumbai.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nAhead of the players mega auction, Chennai Super Kings retained Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina & Ravindra Jadeja. Additionally, Faf du Plessis and Dwayne Bravo were brought back into the side using RTM. The return of the Super Kings to the IPL was the cause of a large amount of celebration and fanfare amongst the fans, with a crowd of more than 10,000 turning up for the practice sessions held at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai before the start of the tournament.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nChennai's campaign started off with a thrilling one wicket win over the Mumbai Indians in the first match of the season.[56] Playing their first home game in Chennai, the Kings successfully managed to chase down a target of 202 set by the Kolkata Knight Riders, aided by a quickfire half-century by Sam Billings. The team then went on to lose to Kings XI Punjab in Mohali but bounced back by winning three matches in a row against the Rajasthan Royals, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bangalore. The Super Kings' next eight matches resulted in them alternating between victories and defeats by winning against the Delhi Daredevils, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kings XI Punjab and losing against the Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Delhi Daredevils and the Kolkata Knight Riders.[57] The league stage ended with the Super Kings in second place behind the Sunrisers.[58] Chennai then went on to post back-to-back victories against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the first qualifier and in the final to win the Indian Premier League for the third time since the inception of the tournament.[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree of the five centuries scored in the 2018 season were by players belonging to the Chennai Super Kings (Ambati Rayudu 100* and Shane Watson 106, 117*). The Super Kings also became the first team to defeat an opposing team (Sunrisers Hyderabad) four times in a single season.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe home ground of the Super Kings is the historic M. A. Chidambaram Stadium (commonly called \\"The Chepauk\\") located in Chennai. The stadium is named after former BCCI President M. A. Chidambaram. It is the oldest stadium in India which is in continuous use. The stadium is owned by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association and has a seating capacity of 50,000 as of May 2013.[62] In 2010, the stadium underwent a major renovation for hosting some of the matches of the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. The seating capacity was increased from 36,000 to 50,000 and three new stands were established during this renovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Super Kings have a 67.44% win record at this venue, which is often referred to as \\"Fortress Chepauk\\"[63] and \\"Lions' den\\".[64] In the 2011 season, the Super Kings won all their home games (8 matches) including the final against Royal Challengers Bangalore. The Super Kings thus became the first team to win all their home games in a season and also the first team to win the tournament at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, Chennai Super Kings played all their home matches at Ranchi due to issues with Government of Tamil Nadu.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, Chennai Super Kings managed to play a solitary home game against Kolkata Knight Riders due to members of a few fringe political parties staging protests outside the stadium as well as several parts of Chennai demanding the IPL matches to be moved out of the city until the Cauvery Management Board (CMB) was set up as directed by the honourable Supreme Court of India. Despite tight security for the match against KKR, the Chennai police expressed their inability in ensuring enough personnel at the venue for the smooth conduct of the remaining games. The remaining six home matches of Chennai Super Kings were moved out of Chennai. Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune was selected to host the remaining six home matches of Chennai Super Kings.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nMahendra Singh Dhoni, who was the captain of the Indian limited-overs team in 2008, was bought by the Super Kings for $1.5 million at the 2008 players' auction. He was the most expensive player in the IPL until 2009 when the Super Kings signed up English all-rounder Andrew Flintoff for $1.55 million. Dhoni is one of the most successful captains in the IPL, having led the Super Kings to seven finals of which the team has won three.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vice-captain of the team from 2008 to 2015 was Suresh Raina. Raina holds multiple IPL records such as most caps, most runs and most catches.[67] Australian batsman Michael Hussey has the best batting average for the Super Kings.[68] He was the first batsman from the Super Kings to score a century in the IPL. After Matthew Hayden's retirement in 2010, Hussey took over his place of opening batsman and was the team's leading run-scorer in 2011 and 2013 seasons.[69][70] Murali Vijay, who played for the team from 2009 to 2013, is the first Indian batsman to score two centuries in the IPL. Super Kings' spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has the third best economy rate in IPL (6.53)[71] and is the leading wicket-taker for the team.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chennai franchise named the team as Chennai Super Kings to honor the rulers of the Tamil empire. The word \\"super\\" is used commonly in southern India especially in Tamil Nadu. The team name also derives from India Cements' brand \\"Coromandel King\\".[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team logo features the head of a roaring lion in orange and the team name rendered in blue. The crown above the team name is the same as that used in the logo of the brand Coromandel King. According to the logo designers, since lion is the king of the jungle, the roaring lion logo reflects the team name. The details of the logo signifies various qualities such as youth, vibrancy, solid performance orientation and fiery spirit.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team's primary colour is yellow with blue and orange stripes on either sides of the jersey. The jersey also incorporates the roaring lion logo in the center of the shirt below the logo of the main sponsor Aircel. The basic look of the jersey has remained same from the first season with no changes except for the sponsor placement. The kit manufacturer until 2014 was Reebok and from 2015, Australian Apparel and Sports Gear manufacturer Spartan manufactures kits for the team.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuthoot Group is the current principal shirt sponsor, having signed a three year deal in 2018.[75] Telecom service provider Aircel was the previous shirt sponsor after they signed a three-year deal in 2008 which was then renewed in 2011 for ? 850?million, then the most expensive sponsorship deal in IPL.[76][77] The team also has sponsorship deals with India Cements, Gulf Oil, Equitas Small Finance Bank, HIL, Nippon Paint, Parle Agro Frooti and Atria Convergence Technologies.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team's theme song is the Whistle Podu designed by Aravind-Shankar (duo of Aravind Murali and Jaishankar Iyer). Although the track was created only for YouTube in 2008, it gained popularity during the 2009 season and later became the team's theme song. The video of the song represents the street dance form of dappangutthu which is very popular among certain communities in Tamil Nadu. It is also a folk dance and music genre employed in Tamil cinema. The recordings of some of the Super Kings players whistling were used in the music video.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chennai Super Kings are the most consistent and their records are still left unbeaten despite the 2 years ban in 2016, 2017 seasons. Though other teams consider CSK as a strong rival, Chennai Super Kings record of reaching knockout stage every played season is unmatched by any team in IPL history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chennai Super Kings have active rivalries with the Mumbai Indians and the Royal Challengers Bangalore. The Super Kings and Mumbai Indians have played against each other more number of times than any other two teams in the IPL.[80] They are the two most successful IPL teams and often termed as \\"big spenders\\" at the players auction.[81][82] The two sides have met each other at the final of the IPL thrice, with Mumbai winning two of them and Chennai winning once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rivalry with Royal Challengers Bangalore stems from the Kaveri River water dispute between the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The rivalry is also called \\"Kaveri derby\\" and \\"South Indian derby\\".[83][84][85] The Super Kings beat the Royal Challengers in the final of the 2011 IPL, the only meeting between the two teams at an IPL final.\\r\\n\\r\\nCSK was adjugded by Brand Finance to be the most valuable brand at $65 Million USD after the completion of IPL 2018 with the team lifting its third title in a dream return, tying them along with Mumbai Indians as the most successful team of IPL with three titles each.[86]. The Economic Times commissioned UK-based Brand Finance to carry out brand evaluation of the IPL and also each of the eight franchise teams (that was increased to 10 in 2011). Chennai Super Kings was rated as the \\"most valuable team\\" in the Indian Premier League in 2010ÿ11, with a brand value of $100\\r\\nmillion (approximately ? 2.24?billion).[87] In February 2013, London based Brand Finance evaluated the top 150 most valuable teams in the world, in which Chennai Super Kings is placed in the 147th place valued at $46 million just behind the Mumbai Indians.[88].\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil September 2008, BCCI regulation, Clause 6.2.4 stated that \\"No administrator could have, directly or indirectly, any commercial interest in the matches or events conducted by the board\\". However, N. Srinivasan, who was then the treasurer and vice-chairman of BCCI, became the de facto owner of the Chennai Super Kings since he was the Managing Director of India Cements. Former BCCI President A. C. Muthiah wrote to the BCCI regarding the violation of this clause in 2008 but the BCCI did not respond. In September 2008, Muthiah went to the Madras High Court to restrain BCCI from allowing Srinivasan to participate in the general body meeting where the election was to be held. However, the suit was dismissed by the High Court and the following day, Srinivasan was elected as the Secretary of BCCI.[89] The clause was amended as \\"No administrator shall have, directly or indirectly, any commercial interest in any of the events of the BCCI, excluding IPL, Champions League and Twenty20\\".[90] Muthiah then moved to the Supreme Court which gave a split verdict in April 2011. Later in August 2011, Muthiah filed another petition to stop Srinivasan from taking over as the BCCI President[91] but the Supreme Court rejected the petition, and Srinivasan was elected the President of BCCI.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, the owners of other teams were concerned about the possible rigging that could have taken place in the IPL auctions. Nita Ambani, the owner of Mumbai Indians questioned the changing the order of players just before the auction began.[93] Former IPL chairman Lalit Modi accused Srinivasan of arm-twisting him and rigging the 2009 IPL auction to ensure that English all-rounder Andrew Flintoff was bought by the Chennai Super Kings while it was refuted by Srinivasan.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2013, Gurunath Meiyappan, son-in-law of Srinivasan, was arrested by Mumbai Police on charges of placing bets on IPL matches [95] Meiyappan, who was the Team Principal of the Super Kings, was issued a summons by the Mumbai Police and on interrogation it was found that Meiyappan was in contact with bookies through actor Vindu Dara Singh.[96] Following this, Srinivasan, on 2 June 2013, decided to step aside as BCCI President temporarily until the inquiry into the betting case completed.[97] In February 2014, the three member panel appointed by the Supreme Court of India enquired into the betting case indicted Meiyappan for illegal betting during the 2013 IPL.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 March 2014, the Supreme Court of India issued an ultimatum to the BCCI demanding that Srinivasan either step down as President or be removed from his position.[99] On 14 July 2015, the Supreme Court appointed RM Lodha committee suspended the owners of Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings from the Indian Premier League for a period of two years.[2] On 24 February 2016, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear a plea for lifting the ban on the Chennai Super Kings.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy opposition[107]\\r\\n\\r\\n Last updated: 5 May 2018\\r\\n\\r\\n2008 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2009 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2010 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2010 Champions League\\r\\n\\r\\n2011 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2012 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2013 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2014 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2014 Champions League\\r\\n\\r\\n2015 Indian Premier league\\r\\n\\r\\n2018 Indian Premier league","input":"How many times csk reached final in ipl?"},{"output":"Sosa's top assassin, the Skull","context":"Antonio \\"Tony\\" Montana is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the 1983 film Scarface. He is portrayed by Al Pacino in the movie, and is voiced by Andr Sogliuzzo in the 2006 video game Scarface: The World Is Yours. Embodying the rise from the bottom to the top, Tony Montana has become a cultural icon and is one of the most famous movie characters of all time. In 2008, Montana was named the 27th Greatest Movie Character by Empire Magazine.[1] He is partly based on Tony Camonte, the protagonist of the original novel and the 1932 film adaptation. By association the character is also inspired by Al Capone. According to Oliver Stone, Tony's last name was inspired by former NFL quarterback, Joe Montana, Stone's favorite player. A prequel novel, Scarface: The Beginning, written by L.A. Banks, was released in 2006.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1980, Tony is one of the 125,000 Cubans who after seeking refuge in the Peruvian Embassy, wound up on the Mariel Boatlift to Miami. When he gets there, he is questioned by U.S. officials; he says that he was a \\"political prisoner\\" and that because he had an American father, he has the right to a green card. However, because of a trident-style tattoo on his right hand, which indicates that he was an assassin in prison, his request is denied.\\r\\nTony and his friend Manolo \\"Manny\\" Ribera are sent to \\"Freedomtown\\", a refugee camp that holds Cuban immigrants without green cards. After one month in the camp, Frank Lopez, head of a Miami drug cartel, offers to obtain them green cards in return for murdering Emilio Rebenga. Soon after Rebenga arrives at the camp, Manny, Tony, and Angel Fernandez take advantage of the August 11 riot, where Tony stabs Rebenga. Tony and Manny are granted green cards and released, and the two get jobs as dishwashers for a small food stand in Little Havana. In August 1980, Frank sends his right-hand man, Omar Suarez, to offer them a deal smuggling marijuana, offering $500, a small amount of pay but with low risk of arrest or gun battles. Tony demands more pay, and he and Omar quarrel. On the advice of his compatriot, Omar then offers Tony and Manny $5000 to buy cocaine from a new supplier, which is riskier than the marijuana deal but will pay much more, as it is dealing with violent Colombians.\\r\\nA few days later, Tony, Manny, and their associates Angel and Chi Chi drive to a hotel in Miami Beach to make the deal with a group of Colombians. The deal goes bad; a couple of Colombian enforcers handcuff Tony and Angel to a shower pole at gunpoint, threatening to kill them with a chainsaw if Tony does not reveal the location of the drug money. Tony refuses to talk, and Hector, the enforcers' leader, dismembers Angel. Before Hector can do the same to Tony, Manny bursts in the room, shooting an SMG. A short gunfight ensues in which Manny is shot in the arm, and Tony kills the Colombians. Tony, Manny, and Chi Chi escape with the cocaine and the money. Tony, who no longer trusts Omar, takes it to Frank personally, and he and Manny end up working for him. Meanwhile, Tony takes an interest in Frank's girlfriend, Elvira Hancock.\\r\\nThree months later, Tony pays a visit to his mother Georgina and younger sister Gina, neither of whom he has seen for five years. Gina is excited to see Tony, but his mother is ashamed of him, having long ago learned of his life of crime. When he gives his mother $1,000, his mother angrily rejects the gift and throws him out. Tony leaves, but Gina runs after him and hugs him, telling Tony she has been going to hairdressing school and helping out Mama. Tony says that a poor girl like Gina deserves to have a little fun; he slips her the $1,000 secretly and orders her not to tell Mama about it, only that Mama gets a little bit of it from time to time, through using some of it for grocery shopping or paying a utility bill.\\r\\nLater, while in Bolivia, Tony and Omar go on Frank's behalf to see drug cartel lord Alejandro Sosa. Sosa has Omar killed for being a police informant, and makes Tony his business partner. At The Babylon nightclub, Tony is shaken down by corrupt narcotics detective Mel Bernstein, who informs him he has evidence linking Tony to the murders of Rebenga and the Colombian drug dealers. Bernstein proposes to \\"tax\\" Tony on his transactions in return for police protection and information. Tony is convinced Frank sent Bernstein because only Frank would know details about the murders. While talking to Bernstein, Tony sees Gina dancing with a low-level drug dealer. Enraged, Tony beats the dealer and slaps Gina, stopping only after Manny calms him down. Manny drives Gina home and tells her she can do better than those low lives and that Tony is only looking out for her. However, when Gina admits an interest in Manny, he freezes, fearing Tony's wrath.\\r\\nThat night, two men attempt to kill Tony. He escapes, and becomes convinced that Frank ordered his death. Armed with silenced pistols, Tony and Manny track Frank down to his car dealership, killing him and Bernstein. Afterward, Tony goes to Frank's house, telling Elvira that her lover is dead and that he wants her. Over the next year-and-a-half, Tony makes $75 million off of 2,000 kilograms of cocaine that he brings to America, and is soon making $10ÿ15 million every month in profits from his business relationship with Sosa. He marries Elvira and takes over Frank's empire, purchasing a large mansion as well as ornate luxuries such as a pet tiger. Tony also creates many legal businesses as fronts, including a hairdresser's managed by Gina. However, cracks in Tony's \\"American dream\\" begin to form as both he and Elvira become addicted to cocaine. Meanwhile, Manny and Gina begin dating behind her brother's back, afraid of Tony's wrath should he find out.\\r\\nIn February 1983, Tony is arrested for tax evasion and money laundering. Tony's lawyer, George Sheffield, tells him that although he can plea bargain away most of the time Tony faces, he will still end up serving at least three years in prison. Sosa calls Tony down to Bolivia and asks him for help assassinating a Bolivian anti-government activist, who is exposing Sosa's dealings with Bolivian leaders. In exchange, Sosa will use his contacts in the U.S. Justice Department in Washington, D.C., to keep Tony out of prison. After returning to Miami, Tony does not tell Manny about the hit, although tries to talk Tony out of going to New York, simply citing a bad premonition he has about it. Not long after, Elvira leaves Tony for good after he insults her in a local restaurant. An intoxicated Tony starts yelling at the patrons: he tells them that they need people like him to blamea \\"bad guy\\".\\r\\nTony and Sosa's associate Alberto travel to New York to assassinate the activist. Alberto plants a bomb under the activist's car, planning to detonate it as he drives to the United Nations Building to give a speech about his activist work. On the day the assassination is to take place, Tony orders Alberto not to set off the bomb because the activist's wife and children are in the car as well, something which is of no concern to Alberto. When Alberto tries to detonate the bomb anyway, Tony attempts to persuade him using logic and stories from his childhood in Cuba. When this does not work, Tony shoots and kills Alberto, thus double-crossing Sosa.\\r\\nOn December 9, 1983 Tony returns to Florida and receives a telephone call from a furious Sosa, who admonishes him for the hit's failure. Tony attempts to locate Manny, and finds him and Gina together, both wearing nothing but bathrobes. Tony shoots and kills him in a cocaine-fueled rage, before Gina reveals that they had just married and were going to announce their matrimony to Tony. Tony and his men take a distraught Gina back to his mansion. Meanwhile, a large group of assassins sent by Sosa surround the mansion. While a distraught Tony sits in his office, snorting vast quantities of cocaine, the gunmen begin killing his guards outside. Gina enters Tony's office wielding a Smith & Wesson Model 36, accusing him of wanting her for himself, before shooting him in the leg. Tony attempts to calm her down, before one of the assassins enters the office through the window and opens fire, killing Gina. Tony immediately kills the assassin, creating a commotion.\\r\\nDeprived of the element of surprise, Sosa's gunmen directly attack Tony's mansion. Tony bursts from his office wielding a M16 assault rifle with a M203 grenade launcher attachment. He yells \\"Say hello to my little friend!\\" and opens fire on the henchmen, killing dozens of them despite being heavily wounded himself by return fire. The carnage continues until Sosa's top assassin, the Skull, sneaks up behind him and shoots him in the back. Tony falls from his balcony into a fountain in the lobby below, floating face-down dead in a pool of blood and water beneath a statue of the globe carrying the inscription \\"The World Is Yours\\".\\r\\nThe video game titled Scarface: The World Is Yours, a quasi-sequel to the film, features an alternate ending in which Tony kills the Skull and survives the assassination attempt, but still loses most of his wealth and possessions. Tony detects his would-be assassin and shoots him before escaping his mansion. The end of the first mission shows that he lost $65,884,703 (which is how much Scarface made in box office) and 25,000 kilos of cocaine.\\r\\nFor the next three months, he goes into hiding in a small shack near Virginia Key Beach Park in Miami where he only had basic necessities, his trademark 1963 Cadillac Series 62, $1,000, and a M1911 pistol. His mansion is seized by undercover police officers, but he is able to move back in by bribing them with $10,000 that he makes in a single day of selling drugs.\\r\\nDuring this quest for vengeance, Tony takes down several rivals who are eager to take over his empire after the assassination attempt. Alejandro Sosa and Gaspar Gomez have since teamed up to form a drug monopoly, and set their prices unreasonably high. George Sheffield (James Woods), his former lawyer, betrays him to Gomez and Sosa.\\r\\nTony first reclaims Little Havana, which had been taken over by the Diaz brothers. This included the \\"Lopez Motors\\" dealership where he bought his Porsche 928 in the film, which the brothers since renamed \\"Diaz Motors\\". The game allows the player to venture outside Miami to the Caribbean, where he takes down Nacho Contreras. Tony also meets a bartender named Venus, who becomes one of his girlfriends at the end of the game. At the end of the game, Tony single-handedly takes on a small army at Sosa's home in Bolivia, where he kills Sheffield, Gomez and Sosa.","input":"Who was the man that killed tony montana?"},{"output":"practicing how a building would be evacuated in the event of a fire or other emergencies","context":"A fire drill is a method of practicing how a building would be evacuated in the event of a fire or other emergencies. In most cases, the building's existing fire alarm system is activated and the building is evacuated as if the emergency had occurred. Generally, the evacuation is timed to ensure that it is fast enough, and problems with the emergency system or evacuation procedures are identified to be remedied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe purpose of fire drills in buildings is to ensure that everyone knows how to exit safely as quickly as possible if a fire, smoke, carbon monoxide or other emergency occurs. People need to recognise the sound of the fire alarm.\\r\\nBefore regular fire drills were instituted, a fire that had a major impact broke out at the private Catholic school Our Lady of the Angels in 1958, in Chicago, Illinois, US.[1] Children on the second floor were trapped there, with neither teachers nor pupils knowing how to get out of the building safely. Many children jumped out of windows, and many were killed as they could not make their way to an exit.[1] Although the school had passed a fire inspection two months before, and had the number of fire exits and fire extinguishers required at the time, it lacked smoke detectors or adequate fire alarms, and was overcrowded.[1]\\r\\nThe need for fire drills was recognised; monthly fire drills were put in place after the Our Lady of the Angels fire. It was found in a later study that education on fire also helped to prevent it: people started to learn more about what started fires, and what to do in the case of one starting. They were also aware of the hazards that allow a fire to start. Within a year of the fire, many of the hazardous conditions found in Our Lady of the Angels had been eliminated in thousands of schools around the United States.\\r\\nAfter the fire at Our Lady of the Angel, state regulations required that there had to be fire alarm street boxes no more than one hundred feet from the front of the building. The General Assembly of Illinois also passed life safety codes in response to the fire at Our Lady of the Angel. Things such as more control over waste disposal, proper storage of combustible supplies, more frequent fire drills and inspections were put in place.[2] Other reforms from the fire include the city of Chicago modifying the Municipal Building Code of Chicago, affecting fire safety of schools as well as other buildings with two or more stories.[1] To prevent fires and deaths caused by fires, schools must have an evacuation plan in place, and make sure that all the proper fire alarms and warnings work. Teachers must take charge of the situation and be a leader. Teachers should also consider the number of students that they have. They need enough space and time to get all of the students out quickly, and safely. Teachers should also be the ones that are looking out for causes of fires, in order to try and stop it from happening.[3]\\r\\nIn reviewing how during a school shooting by Mitchell Johnson and Andrew Golden a fire alarm was used, it was realised that such an alarm could motivate the occupants of a building to assemble in one place, appropriate for a fire, but increasing the risk in a shooting. Nick Dial's article suggests possible improvements of a color-coded drill along with other remarks about school security.[4]\\r\\nMany jurisdictions require that fire drills be conducted at certain intervals. This is the case in educational institutions, and also other workplaces and buildings. The frequency of such drills and what must be done during them may be laid down in statutes.\\r\\nIn the United States, school fire drill regulations are set by individual states.\\r\\nSome states require that schools conduct a fire drill once per month:\\r\\nSome states require that schools conduct a specific number of drills over the course of the entire school year, or that a certain number of drills must be conducted within a certain period of time:\\r\\nSome states specify a greater frequency of fire drills at the beginning of the school year:\\r\\nUntil regulations changed on November 1, 2010, New Jersey was unique in its requirement that schools conduct two fire drills per month.[45] Under later requirements one of the two fire drills was replaced by a monthly security drill.[17]\\r\\nThe Government of the United Kingdom requires that all schools, colleges and universities and any other education establishment perform a fire drill at the start of the new academic year in September.[46] and recommends that one should be held every term. According to UK fire regulations, places such as public residences or small buildings should have a fire alarm warning device such as a bell or a sounder installed in every room. Regular safety checks such as testing fire alarms and fire extinguishers should be performed weekly.[47] According to the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, all workplaces must have an emergency plan specifying staff actions, evacuation plans and arrangements for contacting the fire brigade.[48]\\r\\nThe New Zealand Fire Service requires all schools and educational facilities to carry out a fire drill (termed a trial evacuation) at least once every six months, unless a shorter period is specified in the school's approved evacuation scheme. Schools need to give the Fire Service 7-10 working days' notice before a fire drill is planned, and must submit a report to the Fire Service within 7-10 working days of the drill; an unplanned alarm activation does not count as a fire drill.[49]","input":"What is the purpose of the fire drill?"},{"output":"May 17, 2001","context":"Violin Renditions of:\\r\\n\\"My Love\\" by Paul McCartney and Wings\\"[1]\\r\\n\\"A Groovy Kind of Love\\" by Phil Collins\\r\\n\\"The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding\\" is a double length episode of the television sitcom Friends. It first aired on May 17, 2001 as the finale of season seven. It is usually broadcast in a one-hour slot and presented on DVD as one complete episode, but when the episodes are split the two parts are differentiated by the suffixes Part 1 and Part 2. For his guest appearance, Gary Oldman was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMonica is making a list of things which are most likely to go wrong which seems to be all Rachel's chores when suddenly Joey appears telling them that he got a part in the movie which he wanted, which is related to World War I.\\r\\nAt the studios, Joey has started shooting with Richard Crosby (Gary Oldman) who keeps spitting while saying his lines which annoys Joey. When he can't stand it anymore, he talks to Richard about it, when Richard tells him that all good actors spit while saying their lines. Therefore, when they shoot the next scene, Joey and Richard both constantly spit at each other while saying their lines. When their scenes are over for the day, Joey is given lines for scenes for the next day. However, Joey can't come the next day since he is performing Monica and Chandler's wedding. Because he's still in the mood of saying the lines, he accidentally spits on the man who gave him the lines, while telling him that he has important plans due to which he can't come.\\r\\nBack at Monica's apartment, Chandler and Monica are going to their wedding rehearsal. Chandler listens to the answering machine after Monica leaves when he realizes they're becoming \\"The Bings\\". At the rehearsal things are going smoothly until Chandler's parents come and things go crazy. When Chandler's mom, Nora Tyler-Bing (played by Morgan Fairchild), is introduced to Monica's parents Jack and Judy Geller, Jack embarrasses himself by asking her \\"so...are you Chandler's mom or dad?\\" Chandler's mom and Chandler's dad, Charles Bing (played by Kathleen Turner), keep having arguments. As a consequence, Rachel is told by Monica to keep them away from each other. Since Rachel doesn't know what Chandler's dad looks like, Monica describes him, saying \\"a man in the black dress\\". When Rachel looks around, she spots a woman in a black dress having a drink nearby, and assumes that she is Chandler's dad. When both of them introduce themselves, the woman says her name is Amanda and Rachel replies \\"Oh, I get it - a-man-duh!\\", embarrassing herself.\\r\\nWhen they return to their apartments, Rachel, Phoebe, and Monica are sitting down at the table in Monica's apartment. Monica gets up, walks to her wedding dress and asks Rachel and Phoebe if anyone wanted to be in charge of looking after the dress. Rachel volunteers, but Monica ignores her since she obviously thinks Rachel is irresponsible from results in the past. Rachel is annoyed when she volunteers twice and Monica doesn't give her the responsibility. She states that she can be responsible, leading Monica to feel as if she was being judgy towards her. She apologizes to Rachel and hands over the responsibility to her.\\r\\nAfter the dinner, when Ross goes to Joey's apartment looking for Chandler (who's staying there that night because of the whole \\"the groom isn't supposed to see the bride before the wedding\\" thing), he finds an empty apartment and a note. When he unfolds it, he finds a note from Chandler saying \\"tell Monica I'm sorry\\". Ross immediately goes across the hall to Monica's apartment - Rachel opens the door when Monica is in her bedroom, and Ross explains the situation to her. A little while later, Phoebe arrives at the door to find out what's going on and when Rachel just hands over the note without explaining the situation, Phoebe assumes Ross wrote it and tells him to tell Monica himself that he's sorry. Ross goes out to search for Chandler but unfortunately fails.\\r\\nThe next morning, Ross arrives at Monica's apartment and informs Rachel and Phoebe that he still hasn't found Chandler. When he leaves, Monica comes out of her room in excitement and starts getting ready. Seeing that Chandler still isn't found and Monica's so excited and thrilled about her wedding day, Rachel starts to panic and eventually cries. Therefore, Phoebe takes her to the bathroom because Monica can't see her in this state or she will know something's wrong. When they're in there, Phoebe finds a positive pregnancy test in the garbage and deduces that Monica is pregnant.\\r\\nRoss tells Rachel to stall Monica so he can have more time to search for Chandler and Phoebe helps him search. When Monica comes back out of her room to begin getting ready for the wedding, Rachel distracts her by saying \\"I'm never gonna get married\\" and started to cry.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Ross and Phoebe find a confused Chandler in his office. He tells them he loves Monica so much, and he doesn't want to hurt her, but he's afraid that becoming 'the Bings' will spell marital misery, maybe as bad as his parents. Ross convinces Chandler to go back to the apartment and begin getting ready, doing one thing at a time, not thinking about the goal. In Monica's apartment, Rachel tries other less believable tactics to distract Monica and she realizes that something is going on. Rachel decides to tell Monica, and starts saying \\"We can't find Chandler...\\". At this point, Phoebe opens the door and gives a thumbs-up sign to Rachel, who suddenly changes the subject \\"Chandler...'s vest\\", controlling the situation.\\r\\nAt the studios, Joey is stuck shooting an easy scene over and over since Richard is drunk and can barely stay focused. The director makes it very clear to Joey that he can't leave until the scene is finished or as long as Richard is on set and conscious, so Joey convinces a confused Richard that they've completed all of their scenes and sends him home.\\r\\nAt the hotel, everything is ready for the wedding when Joey calls Rachel to warn her that he'll be late. Meanwhile, Ross is keeping an eye on Chandler since he still has cold feet. Chandler steps out to sneak a cigarette when he suddenly hears Phoebe and Rachel coming, so he ducks into a storeroom to hide. He overhears that Monica's pregnant and takes off again. Rachel finds another wedding finishing up in the same hotel and convinces the minister to officiate the wedding in case Joey doesn't arrive in time. Meanwhile, Ross and Phoebe find Chandler again, who admits that he was indeed running away until he found a small baby outfit in the hotel's gift store and realized that someone that small can't be scary. He then goes with Phoebe and Ross to the wedding.\\r\\nAs the ceremony begins, Joey finally arrives and takes his place between Monica and Chandler, accidentally letting slip that Chandler had second thoughts about the wedding. Monica delivers her self-written vow, while Chandler delivers one from the heart - both speeches are very moving. When the ceremony is over Chandler tells Monica that he knows about her being pregnant and how Phoebe told him she found a pregnancy test in the trash, but she reveals she didn't take a pregnancy test. Phoebe exclaims to Rachel how Chandler & Monica are now married and how great it is that they're going to have a baby, and the camera zooms in on Rachel as she manages out a weak \\"uh-huh\\" with a slightly panicked look on her face, thus revealing to the audience that she's the one who's pregnant.\\r\\nThe show was filmed over two weeks, with all of the scenes featuring Gary Oldman being filmed in the first week. The wedding was filmed in the second week, with the final shot of Rachel filmed after the studio audience had left.[2]\\r\\nThe first part has a 9.1 rating at TV.com[3] with the second having a slightly higher 9.3.[4] Gary Oldman received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his portrayal of Richard Crosby.

Eight teams from each of the two conferences qualify for the playoffs based on regular season points totals. The final round is commonly known as the Stanley Cup Finals, which sees the two conference champions play for the Stanley Cup.\\r\\nThe NHL has always used a playoff tournament to determine its champion. Its playoff system has changed over the years, from the league's inception in 1917 when ownership of the Stanley Cup was shared between different leagues, to when the NHL took over the Cup in 1926, to the current setup today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stanley Cup playoffs consists of four rounds of best-of-seven series. Each series is played in a 2ÿ2ÿ1ÿ1ÿ1 format, meaning the team with home-ice advantage hosts games one, two, five, and seven, while their opponent hosts games three, four, and six. Games five, six, and seven are only played if needed.\\r\\nEight teams in each conference qualify for the playoffs. In the playoff series format instituted in 2014, the first, second, and third place team in each of the four divisions qualify for the playoffs automatically. Two additional teams from each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, also qualify for the playoffs by having the highest point totals out of the remaining teams in the conference. These teams are referred to as the Wild Cards. Since there is no attention paid to divisional alignment with the wild cards, it is possible for one division in each conference to have five teams in the postseason while the other has just three.\\r\\nIn the First Round,[1] the teams are split into two separate brackets by division. Each bracket consists of the top three divisional qualifiers and one of the wild cards. The lower seeded wild card plays against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card plays against the other division winner, and both wild cards are de facto #4 seeds. The other two series match the second and third place teams from the divisions.\\r\\nThe winners of both First Round series advance to the Second Round.[1] The reseeding in the previous format, which ensured the top seed would play the lowest remaining seed, was discarded. The winners of these series advance to the Conference Finals and the two Conference Final winners move on to the Stanley Cup Finals.[1]\\r\\nIn the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record (regardless of seeding); in the case of a tie, the league's standard tiebreaking procedure is applied. The team with home-ice advantage hosts games one, two, five, and seven, while the opponent hosts games three, four, and six (games five through seven are played if necessary).\\r\\nAny ties in the standings at the end of the regular season are broken using the following protocols:\\r\\nThe National Hockey League has always used a playoff tournament to determine its champion, generally opening up its playoff games to a much larger number of teams, including those with a losing regular season record in some years (the most recent being the seventh and eighth seeded San Jose Sharks and Edmonton Oilers, respectively, in 1999).\\r\\nFrom the NHL's inception until 1920, both NHL and Pacific Coast Hockey Association teams were eligible for the Stanley Cup. The NHL's regular season was divided into two halves, with the top team from each half moving on to the league finals, which was a two-game total goals series in 1918 and a best-of-seven series in 1919. In 1920, the Ottawa Senators were automatically declared the league champion when the team had won both halves of the regular season. The two halves format was abandoned the next year, and the top two teams faced off for the NHL championship in a two-game total goals series.\\r\\nAt the time, the NHL champion would later face the winners of the PCHA and, from 1921, the Western Canada Hockey League in further rounds in order to determine the Stanley Cup champion. During this time, as the rules of the NHL and those of the western leagues differ (the main difference being that NHL rules allowed five skaters while the western leagues allowed six), the rules for each game in the Stanley Cup Finals alternated between those of the NHL and the western leagues. Before the WCHL competed for the Stanley Cup, the Cup championship series a best-of-five series. Following the involvement of the WCHL, one league champion was given a bye straight to the finals (a best-of-three affair starting in 1922), while the other two competed in a best-of-three semifinal. As travel expenses were high during these times, it was often the case that the NHL champions were sent west to compete. In a dispute between the leagues in 1923 about whether to send one or both western league champions east, the winner of the PCHA/WCHL series would proceed to the Stanley Cup Finals, while the loser of the series would face the NHL champion, both series being best-of-three.\\r\\nIn 1924 the NHL playoffs expanded from two to three teams (with the top team getting a bye to the two-game total goal NHL finals), but because the first-place Hamilton Tigers refused to play under this format, the second and third place teams played for the NHL championship in a two-game total goals affair. The Stanley Cup Finals returned to a best-of-five format the same year.[3]\\r\\nWith the merger of the PCHA and WCHL in 1925 and the merged league's collapse in 1926, the NHL took de facto control of the Stanley Cup. While the Cup would not be formally deeded to the league until 1947, from 1926 onward the NHL playoffs and the Stanley Cup playoffs are considered synonymous. The NHL was subsequently divided into the Canadian and American divisions until the 1927ÿ28 season. For 1927, six teams qualified for the playoffs, three from each division, with the division semifinals and finals being a two-game total goals affair, and the Stanley Cup Finals becoming a best-of-five series. In 1928, the playoff format was changed so that the two teams with identical division ranking would face each other (i.e. the first place teams played each other, the second place teams play each other, and likewise for the third place teams). The first place series was a best-of-five affair, with the winner proceeding to the best-of-three Stanley Cup Finals, while the others were a two-game total goals series. The winner of the second and third place series played each other in a best-of-three series, with the winner earning the other berth to the Stanley Cup Finals. This format had a slight modification the following year, where the semifinal series became a two-game total goals affair and the Stanley Cup Finals became a best-of-five series. The two-game total goals format was abolished in 1937, with those series being changed to best-of-three affairs.[4]\\r\\nThe 1930s saw the reduction of teams from ten to seven, and with it an end to the Canadian and American divisions. The Stanley Cup playoffs saw the first- and second-place teams play against each other in a best-of-seven series for one berth in the Stanley Cup Finals, while the third- to sixth-place teams battled in a series of best-of-three matches for the other berth (with the third-place team taking on the fourth-place team, and the fifth-place team against the sixth-place team). In 1939, the Stanley Cup Finals became a best-of-seven series, the format still used today.[4]\\r\\nThe 1942ÿ43 season saw the removal of the New York Americans, leaving six remaining teams (known today as the \\"Original Six\\"). Throughout this era, the first and third-place teams played in one best-of-seven semifinal, while the second and fourth-place teams played in the other best-of-seven semifinal. During this time, Detroit Red Wings fans often threw an octopus onto the ice as a good luck charm, as eight wins were required to win the Stanley Cup.[4]\\r\\nThe 1967 expansion saw the number of teams double from six to 12 in the 1967ÿ68 season, and with it the creation of the Western and Eastern divisions. The playoff format remained largely the same, with all series remaining best-of-seven, and the division champions battling for the Stanley Cup. The 1970ÿ71 season, because of fan demand, brought forth the first inter-conference playoff matchup outside of the Stanley Cup Finals since the pre-war expansion, which had the winner of the second-place versus fourth-place matchup in one conference take on the winner of the first- versus third-place matchup in the other conference for a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals. The following year had one minor change to its playoff format: a stronger team would face a weaker opponent. Thus, instead of a first-place versus third-place and a second versus fourth-place matchup in the first round, the first round had the first-place versus the fourth and the second versus the third-place. This practice of having stronger teams facing weaker opposition has continued to the present day.[4]\\r\\nThe 1974ÿ75 season saw another change to its playoff system to accommodate the league of 18 teams, 12 of which qualified for the playoffs. The top team from each division would earn a bye to the quarterfinal, while the second- and third-place teams from each division started their playoff run from a best-of-three preliminary round. In each round of the playoffs, the teams remaining were seeded regardless of divisional or conference alignment, with the preliminary-round series being a best-of-three affair while the remainder of the series remained best-of-seven. The 1977ÿ78 season had one minor change in its playoff format: although the second-place finishers from each division would qualify for the preliminary round, the four playoff spots reserved for the third-place teams were replaced by four wild-card spotsspots for the four teams with the highest regular-season point total that did not finish first or second in their divisions.[4]\\r\\nWith the absorption of four teams from the World Hockey Association in the 1979ÿ1980 season, a new playoff system was introduced where 16 of the league's 21 teams would qualify for postseason play. The four division winners would qualify for the playoffs while twelve wildcard positions rounded out the sixteen teams. At the beginning of each round the teams were seeded based on their regular season point totals, with the preliminary round being a best-of-five series while all other playoff series were best-of-seven.[4]\\r\\nThe 1981ÿ1982 season brought forth the return of divisional matchups, with the top four teams from each division qualifying for the playoffs. Division champions would be determined, followed by the Conference champions, who would meet in the Stanley Cup Finals. The division semifinals was a best-of-five affair until the 1986ÿ87 season, when it became a best-of-seven series, while all other series remained best-of seven.[4]\\r\\nFor the 1993ÿ94 season, the league revamped its playoff structure to become conference-based rather than division-based. Eight teams in each conference qualified for the playoffs. The division first-place teams were seeded first (the team with the best record in the conference) and second in the conference playoffs and received home ice advantage for the first two rounds. The next six best teams in each conference also qualified and were seeded third through eighth. All teams played in the first round: first-place versus eighth, second versus seventh, third versus sixth and fourth versus fifth. All series were best-of-seven, but the arrangement of home games was changed for Central and Pacific division teams. Instead of the normal 2ÿ2ÿ1ÿ1ÿ1 rotation, a series involving teams from both divisions was 2ÿ3ÿ2, with the higher seeded team having the option of starting play at home or on the road (ALL teams with home-ice advantage chose to play the default 2-2-1-1-1 format, from 1995-1998). After each round, surviving teams were reseeded to play a conference semi-final, then a conference final. The conference winners then played each other in the Stanley Cup Finals. Home ice advantage was determined by higher seed in the first three rounds and by regular-season points of the two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals.[4]\\r\\nIn 1998ÿ99, the league was re-organized into two conferences of three divisions apiece, resulting in the playoff format used through 2013. The qualifiers remained sixteen, but the seeding changed. The three first-place teams in each division qualified and were seeded first through third for the playoffs. Of the other teams in each conference, the top five finishers qualified for the fourth through eighth seedings. All teams played in the first round: first-place versus eighth, second versus seventh, third versus sixth and fourth versus fifth, by those criteria. After each round, surviving teams were reseeded to play a conference semi-final, then a conference final. Like the 1994ÿ1998 system, the conference winners then played each other in the Stanley Cup Finals, and home ice advantage was determined by higher seed in the first three rounds and by regular-season points of the two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals.[4]\\r\\nThe NHL realigned into a four-division, two-conference system for the 2013ÿ14 season. Under the new postseason system, the top three teams in each division make the playoffs, with two wild-cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference). The format is division-based, similar to the 1981ÿ82 system. In the First Round, the top-ranked team in the conference plays against the lowest-ranked wild-card, while the other division winner plays against the higher ranked wild-card. The second and third place teams in each division then play each other. The first round winners then meet in the Second Round. The third round will still consist of the Western Conference and Eastern Conference Finals, with those conference winners advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals.[5]\\r\\nCompared to other major professional sports leagues, playoff upsets are relatively common in the NHL.[6] According to NHL broadcaster Darren Eliot, this is because the style of competition in the playoffs is different from the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, the goal is to advance through four best-of-seven playoff series.[7] The Presidents' Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team, or other players that pose matchup problems. If the regular season champion's primary success was only outscoring others, they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out.[7] And although rare, another aspect is that the NHL leads the other leagues in game seven comebacks. Only four instances has an NHL team been able to come back from being down 0ÿ3 to win a seven-game series: the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, the 1975 New York Islanders, the 2010 Philadelphia Flyers, and the 2014 Los Angeles Kings. There has been only one such \\"reverse sweep\\" comeback in the MLB postseason (the 2004 Boston Red Sox) and none in the NBA playoffs.\\r\\nNHL broadcaster Darren Eliot explaining the lack of success of Presidents' Trophy winners winning the Stanley Cup.[7]\\r\\nDespite having more American-based teams than Canadian-based ones throughout much of the NHL's existence (dating back to the Original Six era when it was two Canadian clubs to four American ones, and now 7 to 24 since 2017), there have been only two times in league history where none of the Canadian teams qualified for the postseason: 1970 and 2016.[8] However, the 1993 Montreal Canadiens remain the last Canadian club to go all the way and win the Stanley Cup.[9]\\r\\nThe Stanley Cup playoffs MVP award, the Conn Smythe Trophy is based on the entire NHL postseason instead of just the championship game or series, unlike the playoff MVP awards presented in the other major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada (the Super Bowl MVP, the NBA Finals MVP, and the World Series MVP), although in its history the trophy has never been given to someone that was not in the finals. Doug Gilmour and Peter Forsberg, in 1986 and 1999, respectively, are the only players who have topped the postseason in scoring without making it to the Finals.\\r\\nNHL players have often grown beards when their team is in the playoffs, where they do not shave until their team is eliminated or wins the Stanley Cup. The tradition was started in the 1980s by the New York Islanders, and is often mirrored by the fans, as well.[10][11]\\r\\nAt the conclusion of a playoff series, players and coaches line up and exchange handshakes with their counterparts on the opposing team, and this has been described by commentators as \\"one of the great traditions in sports\\".[12] However, there have been rare occasions that individual players have refused to participate, such as Gerry Cheevers who left the ice without shaking hands with any of the Flyers in 1978,[13] and Billy Smith who avoided handshakes as he was particularly passionate about losses.[14] More recent examples of players refusing the handshake include the 1996 playoffs when several Detroit Red Wings players protested the dirty hit by the Colorado Avalanche's Claude Lemieux,[15] and in the 2008 playoffs when Martin Brodeur refused to shake Sean Avery's hand after Avery screened him in an earlier game.[14]\\r\\nIt is common among players to never touch or hoist the Prince of Wales Trophy (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell Bowl (Western Conference champion) after they have won the conference finals; the players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that they should be hoisting. There have been six recent exceptions to this ÿ Scott Stevens of the Devils in 2000 and 2003; Sidney Crosby of the Penguins in 2009, 2016, and 2017; and Alex Ovechkin of the Capitals in 2018. In five of these occurrences, their teams went on to win the Stanley Cup. In recent years, the captain of the winning team poses (usually looking solemn) with the conference trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well.[16]\\r\\nThere are many traditions and anecdotes associated with the championship trophy, the Stanley Cup.\\r\\nBecause the Ice Hockey World Championships are held in the same time period as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the only NHL players who can participate in the former are those on NHL teams that have been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention.[17] This policy has been in place since a 1977 agreement between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation, which allowed Team Canada to field a team in the World Championships after an-eight year absence.[18][19]\\r\\nCorrect as of 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs\\r\\nPrior to 1927 the NHL playoff champion did not receive the Stanley Cup. In most years the winning team was awarded the O'Brien Trophy but from 1915 through 1926 the NHA/NHL champion would play the PCHA/WHL champion for the Stanley Cup.[22] The results outlined here are only those between NHL teams and do not include any Stanley Cup Finals series before 1927. For the first four years the NHL playoffs entailed the best team from the first half of the season playing a two games against the best team from the second half. The winner was the team that scored the most combined goals. There were no NHL playoffs in 1920 because Ottawa had the best record in both halves and was declared the NHL champion. Starting in 1921 the NHL scrapped the half-season scheme and had the teams with the top two records play for the league title. In 1926 the league introduced a two-game semifinal series for the second- and third-best teams to play for entry into the final against the regular season champion. The following year, with 10 teams in the league, the NHL expanded the playoffs to include six teams. The winners of the Canadian and American divisions would earn byes into the semifinal round while the remaining four would start in the quarterfinals.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nThe playoff format was altered slightly in 1929, having the two division winners play one another in the semifinal rather than the winners of the quarterfinal round. Because the NHL took charge of the NHL finals became a best-of series as the Stanley cup championship had been since 1914. A year later the Semifinal round became a best-of series with the division winners playing a five game set and the quarterfinal winners facing off in a best-of-three meeting. In 1931 the meeting between quarterfinal winners reverted to a two-game total-goal series and didn't change back for five years. The next year all series became best-of's and two years after, in 1939, the league ended the divisional format when the Montreal Maroons suspended operations, leaving the league with only 7 teams. Instead, the top two finishers played one another in a best-of-seven semifinal round while the other four playoff teams played best-of-three series to decide the second finalist. The same year the Stanley Cup finals shifted to a best-of-seven series where it has remained ever since (as of 2018).\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nWith only six teams in the league the quarterfinal round was ended and the top four finishers made the playoffs. All playoff series became best-of-sevens with the #1 and #3 teams playing in one semifinal while the #2 and #4 seeds met in the other. This arrangement remained unchanged the entire 25-year duration of the 'Original Six' era.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nWhen the league doubled its size in 1967 they also doubled the number of playoff teams, reintroducing the quarterfinals but keeping the 1-vs-3 style that existed for the previous quarter-century and keeping all series as best-of-sevens. In 1971 the league altered the semifinals to pit east teams against west teams and followed that by rearranging the first round to have the top seeds play the bottom seeds in intra-conference series. Once they league's size swelled to 18 teams an additional four teams received bids into the postseason. Starting in 1975 the division winners received byes into the second round while the remaining eight teams started in a best-of-three preliminary round with the top seed facing the lowest seed. After the opening round all teams were reseeded for the quarterfinals and semifinals regardless of their division or conference.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nWhen the WHA folded in 1979 four teams were absorbed into the NHL. With 21 teams the NHL expanded the playoffs once more to include 16 with all teams starting in the preliminary round which was increased to a best-of-five series. Teams were seeded regardless of their conference or division 1 through 16 and reseeded after the first two rounds. Starting in 1982 the NHL split the playoffs into eastern- and western-conference with each conference providing 8 teams where it has remained since (as of 2018). Furthermore the NHL had the first two round being played within each division, granting the four regions one entry each into the conference finals. The divisional semifinals were expanded to seven-game-series in 1987.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nThe NHL added nine franchises from 1991 to 2000 while an additional four moving to new cities (three of those teams were WHA alumni) Despite the increase in league size the NHL playoffs remained static at 16 teams. The league did, however, change the format by dropping the divisional rounds in 1994 with the division winners receiving the top two seeds and the rest being sorted according to their records.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nAfter the NHL lockout in 2004-05 that saw the cancellation of the first Stanley Cup final in 86 years The league went through another stable period where no new franchises were added. The playoffs as well were mostly consistent throughout the period. Only one change occurred; beginning with the 2014 playoffs the league returned to 4 divisions with the top three teams in each division making the playoffs and the two teams in each conference with the best record receiving 'wild card' spots. The better wild card team would play the lesser division champion for each conference and vice versa.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nThe NHL added Vegas as the first expansion team in 17 years for the 2017-18 season. Though no adjustment occurred as far as the playoffs were concerned, the league also approved an ownership group to make a bid for a 32nd team to be located in Seattle. If approved, the team would not begin play until the 2021-22 season.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs","input":"How many teams are in stanley cup playoffs?"},{"output":"more than 500","context":"This is a list of treaties to which the United States has been a party or which have had direct relevance to U.S. history.\\r\\nIt is a very incomplete list.

Each sale will also make a contribution to the payment of fixed costs as well.\\r\\nFor example, a business that sells tables needs to make annual sales of 200 tables to break-even. At present the company is selling fewer than 200 tables and is therefore operating at a loss. As a business, they must consider increasing the number of tables they sell annually in order to make enough money to pay fixed and variable costs.\\r\\nIf the business does not think that they can sell the required number of units, they could consider the following options:\\r\\n1. Reduce the fixed costs. This could be done through a number or negotiations, such as reductions in rent payments, or through better management of bills or other costs.\\r\\n2. Reduce the variable costs, (which could be done by finding a new supplier that sells tables for less).\\r\\nEither option can reduce the break-even point so the business need not sell as many tables as before, and could still pay fixed costs.\\r\\nThe main purpose of break-even analysis is to determine the minimum output that must be exceeded for a business to profit. It also is a rough indicator of the earnings impact of a marketing activity. A firm can analyze ideal output levels to be knowledgeable on the amount of sales and revenue that would meet and surpass the break-even point. If a business doesn't meet this level, it often becomes difficult to continue operation.\\r\\nThe break-even point is one of the simplest, yet least-used analytical tools. Identifying a break-even point helps provide a dynamic view of the relationships between sales, costs, and profits. For example, expressing break-even sales as a percentage of actual sales can help managers understand when to expect to break even (by linking the percent to when in the week or month this percent of sales might occur).\\r\\nThe break-even point is a special case of Target Income Sales, where Target Income is 0 (breaking even). This is very important for financial analysis. Any sales made past the breakeven point can be considered profit (after all initial costs have been paid)\\r\\nBreak-even analysis can also provide data that can be useful to the marketing department of a business as well, as it provides financial goals that the business can pass on to marketers so they can try to increase sales.\\r\\nBreak-even analysis can also help businesses see where they could re-structure or cut costs for optimum results. This may help the business become more effective and achieve higher returns. In many cases, if an entrepreneurial venture is seeking to get off of the ground and enter into a market it is advised that they formulate a break-even analysis to suggest to potential financial backers that the business has the potential to be viable and at what points.\\r\\nIn the linear Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis model (where marginal costs and marginal revenues are constant, among other assumptions), the break-even point (BEP) (in terms of Unit Sales (X)) can be directly computed in terms of Total Revenue (TR) and Total Costs (TC) as:\\r\\nwhere:\\r\\nThe quantity, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n?\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\left(P-V\\\\right)}\\r\\n\\r\\n, is of interest in its own right, and is called the Unit Contribution Margin (C): it is the marginal profit per unit, or alternatively the portion of each sale that contributes to Fixed Costs. Thus the break-even point can be more simply computed as the point where Total Contribution = Total Fixed Cost:\\r\\nTo calculate the break-even point in terms of revenue (a.k.a. currency units, a.k.a. sales proceeds) instead of Unit Sales (X), the above calculation can be multiplied by Price, or, equivalently, the Contribution Margin Ratio (Unit Contribution Margin over Price) can be calculated:\\r\\nWhere R is revenue generated, C is cost incurred i.e. Fixed costs + Variable Costs or\\r\\nor, Break Even Analysis\\r\\nMargin of safety represents the strength of the business. It enables a business to know what is the exact amount it has gained or lost and whether they are over or below the break-even point.[3] In break-even analysis, margin of safety is the extent by which actual or projected sales exceed the break-even sales.[4]\\r\\nWhen dealing with budgets you would instead replace \\"Current output\\" with \\"Budgeted output.\\" If P/V ratio is given then profit/PV ratio.\\r\\nBy inserting different prices into the formula, you will obtain a number of break-even points, one for each possible price charged. If the firm changes the selling price for its product, from $2 to $2.30, in the example above, then it would have to sell only 1000/(2.3 - 0.6)= 589 units to break even, rather than 715.\\r\\nTo make the results clearer, they can be graphed. To do this, draw the total cost curve (TC in the diagram), which shows the total cost associated with each possible level of output, the fixed cost curve (FC) which shows the costs that do not vary with output level, and finally the various total revenue lines (R1, R2, and R3), which show the total amount of revenue received at each output level, given the price you will be charging.\\r\\nThe break-even points (A,B,C) are the points of intersection between the total cost curve (TC) and a total revenue curve (R1, R2, or R3). The break-even quantity at each selling price can be read off the horizontal axis and the break-even price at each selling price can be read off the vertical axis. The total cost, total revenue, and fixed cost curves can each be constructed with simple formula. For example, the total revenue curve is simply the product of selling price times quantity for each output quantity. The data used in these formula come either from accounting records or from various estimation techniques such as regression analysis.","input":"What is the break even price in economics?"},{"output":"Japan","context":"","input":"Which country occupied korea during world war ii?"},{"output":"John Roberts","context":" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Justice of the United States is the chief judge of the Supreme Court of the United States. As such, he is head of the United States federal court system, which functions as the judicial branch of the nation's federal government. The Chief Justice is one of nine Supreme Court justices; the other eight have the title Associate Justice.\\r\\nThe Chief Justice, as the highest judicial officer in the country, serves as a spokesperson for the federal government's judicial branch, and acts as a chief administrative officer for the federal courts. He is also head of the Judicial Conference of the United States, and in that capacity appoints the director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. By law, he is also a member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and by custom is elected chancellor of the board.\\r\\nThe Chief Justice leads the business of the Supreme Court and presides over oral arguments. When the court renders an opinion, the Chief Justicewhen in the majoritydecides who writes the court's opinion. The Chief Justice also has significant agenda-setting power over the court's meetings. In the case of an impeachment of a President of the United States, which has occurred twice, the Chief Justice presides over the trial in the U.S. Senate. Additionally, the presidential oath of office is typically administered by the Chief Justice (although the Constitution does not assign this duty to anyone in particular).\\r\\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 17 persons have served as chief justice. The first was John Jay (1789ÿ1795). The current chief justice is John Roberts (since 2005). FourEdward Douglass White, Charles Evans Hughes, Harlan Fiske Stone, and William Rehnquistwere previously confirmed for associate justice and subsequently confirmed for chief justice separately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Constitution does not explicitly establish an office of Chief Justice, but presupposes its existence with a single reference in Article I, Section 3, Clause 6: \\"When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.\\" Nothing more is said in the Constitution regarding the office. Article III, Section 1, which authorizes the establishment of the Supreme Court, refers to all members of the Court simply as \\"judges.\\" The Judiciary Act of 1789 created the distinctive titles of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\\r\\nIn 1866, at the urging of Salmon P. Chase, Congress restyled the chief justice's title to the current Chief Justice of the United States. The first person whose Supreme Court commission contained the modified title was Melville Fuller in 1888.[1] The associate justices' title was not altered in 1866, and remains as originally created.\\r\\nThe chief justice, like all federal judges, is nominated by the President and confirmed to office by the U.S. Senate. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution states that all federal judges \\"shall hold their offices during good behavior,\\" meaning that a chief justice's appointment ends only when the justice dies in office, resigns, or is removed from office through the impeachment process. The salary of the chief justice is set by Congress; the current (2017) annual salary is $263,300, which is slightly higher than that of associate justices, which is $251,800.[2] The practice of appointing an individual to serve as chief justice is grounded in tradition; while the Constitution mandates that there be a chief justice, it is silent on the subject of how one is chosen and by whom. There is no specific constitutional prohibition against using another method to select the chief justice from among those justices properly appointed and confirmed to the Supreme Court. Constitutional law scholar Todd Pettys has proposed that presidential appointment of chief justices should be done away with, and replaced by a process that permits the Justices to select their own chief justice.[3]\\r\\nThree incumbent associate justices have been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate as chief justice: Edward Douglass White in 1910, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1941, and William Rehnquist in 1986. A fourth, Abe Fortas, was nominated to the position in 1968, but not confirmed. Despite this, he remained an associate justice. Similarly, when justice William Cushing was nominated and confirmed as chief justice in January 1796, but declined the office, he too remained on the Court. The second chief justice, John Rutledge, had previously served as an associate justice when he was given a recess appointment to serve as chief justice. However, his subsequent nomination to the office was not confirmed by the Senate, and he left office and the Court. In 1933, former associate justice Charles Evans Hughes was confirmed as chief justice.\\r\\nAlong with his general responsibilities as a member of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice has several unique duties to fulfill.\\r\\nArticle I, section 3 of the U.S. Constitution stipulates that the Chief Justice shall preside over impeachment trials of the President of the United States in the U.S. Senate. Two Chief Justices, Salmon P. Chase and William Rehnquist, have presided over the trial in the Senate that follows an impeachment of the president ÿ Chase in 1868 over the proceedings against President Andrew Johnson and Rehnquist in 1999 over the proceedings against President Bill Clinton. Both presidents were subsequently acquitted.\\r\\nMany of the procedures and inner workings of the Court turn on the seniority of the justices. Traditionally, the chief justice has been regarded as primus inter pares (first among equals)that is, the chief justice is the highest-ranking and foremost member of the Court, regardless of that officeholder's length of service when compared against that of any associate justice. This seniority and added prestige enables a chief justice to define the Court's culture and norms, and thus influence how it functions. The chief justice sets the agenda for the weekly meetings where the justices review the petitions for certiorari, to decide whether to hear or deny each case. The Supreme Court agrees to hear less than one percent of the cases petitioned to it. While associate justices may append items to the weekly agenda, in practice this initial agenda-setting power of the chief justice has significant influence over the direction of the court. Nonetheless, a chief justice's influence may be limited by circumstances and the associate justices' understanding of legal principles; it is definitely limited by the fact that he has only a single vote of nine on the decision whether to grant or deny certiorari.[4][5]\\r\\nDespite the chief justice's elevated stature, his vote carries the same legal weight as the vote of each associate justice. Additionally, he has no legal authority to overrule the verdicts or interpretations of the other eight judges or tamper with them.[4] The task of assigning who shall write the opinion for the majority falls to the most senior justice in the majority. Thus, when the chief justice is in the majority, he always assigns the opinion.[6] Early in his tenure, Chief Justice John Marshall insisted upon holdings which the justices could unanimously back as a means to establish and build the Court's national prestige. In doing so, Marshall would often write the opinions himself, and actively discouraged dissenting opinions. Associate Justice William Johnson eventually persuaded Marshall and the rest of the Court to adopt its present practice: one justice writes an opinion for the majority, and the rest are free to write their own separate opinions or not, whether concurring or dissenting.[7]\\r\\nThe chief justice's formal prerogativewhen in the majorityto assign which justice will write the Court's opinion is perhaps his most influential power,[5] as this enables him to influence the historical record.[4] He \\"may assign this task to the individual justice best able to hold together a fragile coalition, to an ideologically amenable colleague, or to himself.\\" Opinion authors can have a big influence on the content of an opinion; two justices in the same majority, given the opportunity, might write very different majority opinions.[5] A chief justice who knows well the associate justices can therefore do muchby the simple act of selecting the justice who writes the opinion of the courtto affect the general character or tone of an opinion, which in turn can affect the interpretation of that opinion in cases before lower courts in the years to come.\\r\\nAdditionally, the chief justice chairs the conferences where cases are discussed and tentatively voted on by the justices. He normally speaks first and so has influence in framing the discussion. Although the chief justice votes firstthe Court votes in order of seniorityhe may strategically pass in order to ensure membership in the majority if desired.[5] It is reported that:\\r\\nChief Justice Warren Burger was renowned, and even vilified in some quarters, for voting strategically during conference discussions on the Supreme Court in order to control the Courts agenda through opinion assignment. Indeed, Burger is said to have often changed votes to join the majority coalition, cast \\"phony votes\\" by voting against his preferred position, and, declined to express a position at conference.[8]\\r\\nThe Chief Justice typically administers the oath of office at the inauguration of the President of the United States. This is a tradition, rather than a constitutional responsibility of the Chief Justice; the Constitution does not require that the oath be administered by anyone in particular, simply that it be taken by the president. Law empowers any federal and state judge, as well as notaries public, to administer oaths and affirmations.\\r\\nIf the Chief Justice is ill or incapacitated, the oath is usually administered by the next senior member of the Supreme Court. Seven times, someone other than the Chief Justice of the United States administered the oath of office to the President.[9] Robert Livingston, as Chancellor of the State of New York (the state's highest ranking judicial office), administered the oath of office to George Washington at his first inauguration; there was no Chief Justice of the United States, nor any other federal judge prior to their appointments by President Washington in the months following his inauguration. William Cushing, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, administered Washington's second oath of office in 1793. Calvin Coolidge's father, a notary public, administered the oath to his son after the death of Warren Harding.[10] This, however, was contested upon Coolidge's return to Washington and his oath was re-administered by Judge Adolph A. Hoehling, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.[11] John Tyler and Millard Fillmore were both sworn in on the death of their predecessors by Chief Justice William Cranch of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia.[12] Chester A. Arthur and Theodore Roosevelt's initial oaths reflected the unexpected nature of their taking office. On November 22, 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Judge Sarah T. Hughes, a federal district court judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, administered the oath of office to then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson aboard the presidential airplane.\\r\\nIn addition, the Chief Justice ordinarily administers the oath of office to newly appointed and confirmed associate justices, whereas the senior associate justice will normally swear in a new Chief Justice or vice president.\\r\\nSince the tenure of William Howard Taft, the office of the Chief Justice has moved beyond just first among equals.[13] The Chief Justice also:\\r\\nUnlike Senators and Representatives who are constitutionally prohibited from holding any other \\"office of trust or profit\\" of the United States or of any state while holding their congressional seats, the Chief Justice and the other members of the federal judiciary are not barred from serving in other positions. Chief Justice John Jay served as a diplomat to negotiate the so-called Jay Treaty (also known as the Treaty of London of 1794), Justice Robert H. Jackson was appointed by President Truman to be the U.S. Prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials of leading Nazis, and Chief Justice Earl Warren chaired The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. As described above, the Chief Justice holds office in the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress.\\r\\nUnder 28 USC,[15] when the Chief Justice is unable to discharge his functions, or that office is vacant, his duties are carried out by the most senior associate justice who is able to act, until the disability or vacancy ends, as chief justice.[3] As of February 13, 2016, Anthony Kennedy is the most senior associate justice.\\r\\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, the following 17 persons have served as Chief Justice:[16]","input":"Who is the chief justice of the u.s. supreme court?"},{"output":"350-1300 CE","context":"An effigy mound is a raised pile of earth built in the shape of a stylized animal, symbol, human, or other figure and generally containing one or more human burials. Effigy mounds were primarily built during the Late Woodland Period (350-1300 CE (current era)). Conical and linear mounds, the predecessors of effigy mounds may date from as far back as 700 BCE (before the current era). They remain places First Peoples frequent to visit and speak with ancestors, to put down tobacco and to give thanks. These sites are primarily visited by Hochungra (pl. of Hochunk) people whose ancestors likely built the great majority of them, though they are also visited by people from other original indigenous nations such as Anishinaabe (Ojibwe), Kikapu, Oneida, Menominii who reside in Wisconsin and surrounding areas. There also remains the possibility that a greater diversity of First Peoples such as ancestors of those named nations may have contributed to building some percentage of the mounds. That is to say that ancestral Hochunk likely popularized the form and other groups may have adopted the practice of building effigy mounds from having observed the Hochunk ancestors methods and aesthetics surrounding their construction.\\r\\nScholars believe that effigy mounds were built primarily for spiritual purposes, although most also fulfilled a burial mound function. According to 2011 ground-penetrating radar and magnetometry studies surveying 586 mounds at 128 sites, 65% of linear mounds in Wisconsin contain evidence of burials, 89% of conical mounds contain evidence of burials, and 87% of effigy (animal and other abstract shaped) mounds contain persistent evidence of burials. Older conical mound construction evolves into effigy mound construction over time. Given the expected rates of decay regarding burial evidence (some conical mounds being as old as 2700 years) it is reasonable to project that all mounds in the conical-to-effigy mound spectrum, are burial or funerary earthworks. The builders of the effigy mounds are usually referred to as the Mound Builders. Native American societies in Wisconsin built more effigy mounds than did those in any other region of North Americabetween 15,000 and 20,000 mounds, at least 4,000 of which remain today.[citation needed] Many mounds on the University of Wisconsin grounds including burial mounds measuring as large as 35 feet in diameter and 5 feet high were removed for grading (ground leveling) purposes as recently as 1909.[1]\\r\\nNative North American effigy mounds have been compared to the large-scale geoglyphs such as the Nazca Lines of Peru.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEffigy mounds are limited to the Northern and Eastern United States, and most likely the French were the first Europeans to see them in their expeditions southward from Canada after 1673.\\r\\nEarly surveyors and settlers noticed and mapped many effigy mounds, but farming and other development erased numerous sites despite efforts to preserve them.\\r\\nAfter the \\"discovery\\" of effigy mounds, and other mounds all over the country, wild theories began to be developed as to how and by whom they were built. The first theories were the most accurate; people in the late 17th century assumed that the mounds had been built by the Native American people who still lived in the vicinity. These logical assumptions lost popularity as more fantastic theories were developed. The most popular of these theories in the 19th century was that an extinct race of Mound Builder people had built the mounds and then vanished. This theory was laid to rest by archaeologists at the Smithsonian Institution in the 1880s.\\r\\nThe Ho-Chunk suggest that effigy mounds were used as places of refuge as well as burial. Some archaeologists today believe that the mounds were built by particular clans or groups to honor their representative animal. Some believe that the animal shape is the clan or extended family of the person or person's buried in the mound. Others believe that the mounds were burial sites for everyday people, while still others believe that the depicted animal might be somehow responsible for transitioning the deceased into the next world. The mounds may also indicate hunting and gathering territories of different groups. Other evidence suggests that effigy mounds were used for all manner of rites and ceremonies, from birth ceremonies to funeral rites.\\r\\nCommon shapes for effigy mounds include birds, bear, deer, bison, lynx, panther, turtles, and water spirits. These are somewhat arbitrary names given to the mound shapes by archaeologists who were simply looking for words that would help them classify the mounds. These shapes were most likely chosen for their particular religious or spiritual significance. The earliest mounds are 'conical'; they are essentially bumps of earth - the simplest and arguably the most intuitive kind of burial. Successive conicals likely evolved into linear mounds. Bird mounds likely came next as modifying a linear mound to make a bird mound required only the addition of a head and a tail. From there many different animal forms emerged. These often expressed a kind of abstract elongation.\\r\\nIn addition to the obvious elongation of tails and the abstracted nature of many of the shapes, colored silts and sand were often used to decorate the mounds. The land was often scraped or raked to move earth from surface soils towards a new mound and in doing so, artful colored sand and silt patterning was sometimes employed as adornment. In terms of positioning, some mounds may have had celestial alignments although with certainty bird mounds were placed in such a way as to suggest that they were flying up or down a hillside, and animal mounds were often placed so as to suggest animals walking along natural landform as well such as a ridge or hillside. It is possible that predominant wind patterns may have been taken into consideration when choosing locations and orientations for bird mounds. In addition bird mounds sometimes appear in different conformations where the wings of the bird may be folded or unfolded to different degrees, suggesting various postures in flying. There are some instances where these different poses may suggest a freeze frame view of a bird flying - wings outstretched, wings partially folded, and wings outstretched again.\\r\\nHochunk ancestors naturally buried their dead next to lakes and rivers, and on hillsides. These locations would later become valued as some of the best places to live by settlers. This is one factor that contributed to high rates of mound destruction. Many mounds were destroyed by people grading earth surrounding their houses or what would become the foundations of houses. In some cases linear mounds were used as foundational fill for new house construction. Looting of mounds by settlers was common and this also contributed to the destruction and defacement of many.[2]\\r\\nAccording to the National Park Service, the area in which effigy mounds are found \\"extends from Dubuque, Iowa, north into southeast Minnesota, across southern Wisconsin from the Mississippi to Lake Michigan, and along the WisconsinÿIllinois boundary.\\"[3]\\r\\nThe Effigy Mound Builders buried one, two or three people in a single mound. These burials were most often done singly - one atop the other in successive years. The effigy mound builders did not include with their dead the wealth of material the Ohio Hopewellians did. This almost complete lack of artifacts accompanying the dead clearly indicates a culture distinct from the Hopewellian, even though mounds with Hopewell type grave goods have been excavated in the same area, and apparently were constructed at roughly the same time as the effigy mounds. Some have speculated that due to the lack of burial goods, that the effigy mound builders were egalitarian peoples.\\r\\nClose to around 15,000 effigy mounds have been lost due to plowing, farming, and grading. The dividing ridge mound group, for example, in Madison Wisconsin was removed and used for fill. Some of this fill was used to make the hill that the State Capitol building sits on. A separate group of mounds had been removed previously to make room for the Capitol hill. Many of the remaining effigy mound sites are parts of national, state, county, or municipal parks. Since 1985, all effigy mounds have been protected under state laws that prohibit disturbance to burial sites or, if on federal or tribal land, the Archaeological Resources Protection Act, the Antiquities Act, and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Wisconsin state law has recently come under fire by Wisconsin state senators Chris Kapenga and Robert Brooks. They have introduced an Assembly Bill 620 (Late 2015) that would allow companies to dig into mounds to determine if there are obvious burial remains present. If no obvious remains were found then a company or landowner would be legally allowed to remove the mounds. In other words, unless on federal or First Peoples' federal trust land (reservations) mound protection laws the burial sites preservation legislation (1985) is in danger of being eroded. After tabling a vote on AB 620, the republican majority state assembly in Madison Wisconsin introduced AB 128 (January 2016) a misdemeanor penalty reassignment bill. In this bill which covers a whole host of minor offenses and their penalties, an algorithm purportedly was used to realign misdemeanor offenses with more appropriate penalties. Those assembly persons handling this software and AB 128 claimed that a glitch removed the one year in jail penalty from the misdemeanor offense of disturbing a burial in Wisconsin, leaving mounds unprotected from companies wishing to remove them save by a fine. When challenged on this assembly persons vowed to fix the glitch and reinstate the one year in jail penalty for burial sites desecration, (instituted originally in the 1985 burial sites preservation legislation). It remains to be seen whether this purported glitch will be remedied or whether AB 128 will be passed quietly and without revision against the will of Wisconsin's First Peoples.","input":"When were most of the effigy mounds built?"},{"output":"Hindi","context":"India is home to several hundred languages.

The dates of the composition and first performance of the opera are uncertain. It was composed no later than July 1688,[2] and had been performed at Josias Priest's girls' school in London by the end of 1689.[3] Some scholars argue for a date of composition as early as 1683.[4][5] The story is based on Book IV of Virgil's Aeneid.[6] It recounts the love of Dido, Queen of Carthage, for the Trojan hero Aeneas, and her despair when he abandons her. A monumental work in Baroque opera, Dido and Aeneas is remembered as one of Purcell's foremost theatrical works.[6] It was also Purcell's only true opera, as well as his only all-sung dramatic work. One of the earliest known English operas, it owes much to John Blow's Venus and Adonis, both in structure and in overall effect.[6] The influence of Cavalli's opera Didone is also apparent.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Dido and Aeneas, Purcell had composed music for several stage works, including nine pieces for Nathaniel Lee's Theodosius, or The Force of Love (1680) and eight songs for Thomas d'Urfey's A Fool's Preferment (1688). He also composed songs for two plays by Nahum Tate (later the librettist of Dido and Aeneas), The Sicilian Usurper (1680) and Cuckold-Haven (1685). Dido and Aeneas was Purcell's first (and only) all-sung opera and derives from the English masque tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally based on Nahum Tate's play Brutus of Alba, or The Enchanted Lovers (1678), the opera is likely, at least to some extent, to be allegorical. The prologue refers to the joy of a marriage between two monarchs, which could refer to the marriage between William and Mary. In a poem of about 1686, Tate alluded to James II as Aeneas, who is misled by the evil machinations of the Sorceress and her witches (representing Roman Catholicism, a common metaphor at the time) into abandoning Dido, who symbolises the British people. The same symbolism may apply to the opera.[6] This explains the addition of the characters of the Sorceress and the witches, which do not appear in the original Aeneid. It would be noble, or at least acceptable, for Aeneas to follow the decree of the Gods, but not so acceptable for him to be tricked by ill-meaning spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the opera is a tragedy, there are numerous seemingly lighter scenes, such as the First Sailor's song, \\"Take a boozy short leave of your nymphs on the shore, and silence their mourning with vows of returning, though never intending to visit them more.\\" Musicologist Ellen T. Harris considers the callousness and cynicism of the song to underline the \\"moral\\" of the story, that young women should not succumb to the advances and promises of ardent young men.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo score in Purcell's hand is extant, and the only seventeenth-century source is a libretto, possibly from the original performance. The earliest extant score, held in the Bodleian Library, was copied no earlier than 1750, well over sixty years after the opera was composed.[8] No later sources follow the act divisions of the libretto, and the music to the prologue is lost. The prologue, the end of the act 2 'Grove' scene, and several dances, were almost certainly lost when the opera was divided into parts to be performed as interludes between the acts of spoken plays in the first decade of the eighteenth century.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of the arias to be published separately was \\"Ah, Belinda\\" in Orpheus Britannicus.[6] The most famous aria of the work is \\"When I am laid in earth\\", popularly known as \\"Dido's Lament\\". Both arias are formed on a lamento ground bass. \\"Dido's Lament\\" has been performed or recorded by artists far from the typical operatic school, such as Klaus Nomi (as \\"Death\\"), Ane Brun and Jeff Buckley. It has also been transcribed or used in many scores, including the soundtrack to the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers (renamed \\"Nixon's Walk\\"). It is played annually by a military band at the Cenotaph remembrance ceremony, which takes place on the Sunday nearest to 11 November (Armistice Day) in London's Whitehall. The music is thought by some to be too simple for Purcell in 1689, but this may simply reflect that the intended performers were schoolchildren.[6] The work is scored for four-part strings and continuo. The fact that the libretto from the Chelsea School performance indicates two dances for guitar, the \\"Dance Gittars Chacony\\" in act 1, and the \\"Gittar Ground a Dance\\" in the 'Grove' scene of act 2, has led one scholar to suggest that Purcell envisioned a guitar as a primary member of the continuo group for the opera.[10] Music for neither of these dances is extant, and it seems likely that Purcell did not compose them, but rather left them to be improvised by the guitarist.[11] Several editions of the opera have been made and have been provided with a continuo realisation; a notable, if rather idiosyncratic edition being that made by Imogen Holst and Benjamin Britten. There are a number of editions with realisations, and the opera's accessibility to amateur performers is a feature that has greatly abetted the growth of its popularity in the latter half of the twentieth century.[12] While the Prologue's music has been lost and has not been reconstructed, several realisations of the opera include a solution to the missing ritornello at the end of the second act. Known to have been part of the score, it is now performed as a dance taken from other, similar works by Purcell, or invented outright in the same vein, to keep the integrity and continuity of the performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nA letter from the Levant merchant Rowland Sherman associates Dido and Aeneas with Josias Priest's girls' school in Chelsea, London no later than the summer of 1688.[13] The first performance may have taken place as early as 1 December 1687,[14] and evidence suggests that the opera was performed at the school again in 1689.[3]  Several scholars have argued that the work was composed for the English court, either for Charles II (and perhaps as early as 1684)[4][5] or for James II.[15] Following the Chelsea performances, the opera was not staged again in Purcell's lifetime. Its next performance was in 1700 as a masque incorporated into an adapted version of Shakespeare's Measure for Measure at Thomas Betterton's theatre in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1705 it disappeared as a staged work, with only sporadic concert performances, until 1895 when the first staged version in modern times was performed by students of the Royal College of Music at London's Lyceum Theatre to mark the bicentenary of Purcell's death.[16] Dido and Aeneas received its first performance outside England on 14 December 1895 in a concert version at the University Society in Dublin.\\r\\n\\r\\nDido and Aeneas premiered in the United States at the Plaza Hotel in New York City on 10 February 1923 performed by the girls of the Rosemary School, although The New York Times noted that \\"considerable liberties\\" had been taken with the score.[17] A concert version with professional musicians organised by the Society of Friends of Music took place on 13 January 1924 at the New York City Town Hall, using a score edited by Artur Bodanzky, who also conducted the performance.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs new critical editions of the score appeared, and with the revival of interest in Baroque music, the number of productions steadily increased. After Jonathan Miller's visit to Bornholm, Denmark, Dido was performed in 2008 at the R?nne Theatre (which had been built in 1823). Devin Duggan conducted. Amongst the new productions of the opera in 2009 (the 350th anniversary of Purcell's birth) were those staged by the De Nederlandse Opera, the Royal Opera, London, the Divertimento Baroque Opera Company, and Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, New York. The Royal Opera production, which featured contemporary dance by Wayne McGregor Random Dance and animated effects by Mark Hatchard, formed part of a double bill with Handel's Acis and Galatea.[19] In 2011 the opera was revived by City Wall Productions and set during World War II.[20] A new Opera North production of the opera opened at Leeds Grand Theatre in February 2013[21] Opera Up Close performed a truncated version in 2011, setting it in an American high school in the 1950s.\\r\\n\\r\\nA version of the opera adapted to modern dance was choreographed by the American Mark Morris, who originally danced both the roles of Dido and the Sorceress. It premiered on 11 March 1989 at the Thatre Varia in Brussels.[22] It has since been performed many times and was filmed in 1995 by Canadian director Barbara Willis Sweete, with Morris in the roles of Dido and the Sorceress.[23] Another dance version, choreographed by Sasha Waltz, premiered at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin on 29 January 2005 and opened with the dancers performing underwater in an enormous tank.[24] The production was subsequently seen at the Grand Thatre in Luxembourg, Opra national de Montpellier, and Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. In both the Morris and the Waltz adaptations, the characters are each portrayed by both a singer and a dancer, with the dancers onstage and the singers performing from the side of the stage or the orchestra pit.\\r\\n\\r\\nDido's court\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opera opens with Dido in her court with her attendants. Belinda is trying to cheer up Dido, but Dido is full of sorrow, saying 'Peace and I are strangers grown'. Belinda believes the source of this grief to be the Trojan Aeneas, and suggests that Carthage's troubles could be resolved by a marriage between the two. Dido and Belinda talk for a timeDido fears that her love will make her a weak monarch, but Belinda and the Second Woman reassure her that \\"The hero loves as well.\\" Aeneas enters the court, and is at first received coldly by Dido, but she eventually accepts his proposal of marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nScene 1: The cave of the Sorceress\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sorceress/Sorcerer is plotting the destruction of Carthage and its queen, and summons companions to help with evil plans. The plan is to send her \\"trusted elf\\" disguised as Mercury, someone to whom Aeneas will surely listen, to tempt him to leave Dido and sail to Italy. This would leave Dido heartbroken, and she would surely die. The chorus join in with terrible laughter, and the Enchantresses decide to conjure up a storm to make Dido and her train leave the grove and return to the palace. When the spell is prepared, the witches vanish in a thunderclap.\\r\\n\\r\\nScene 2: A grove during the middle of a hunt\\r\\n\\r\\nDido and Aeneas are accompanied by their train. They stop at the grove to take in its beauty. A lot of action is going on, with attendants carrying goods from the hunt and a picnic possibly taking place, and Dido and Aeneas are together within the activity. This is all stopped when Dido hears distant thunder, prompting Belinda to tell the servants to prepare for a return to shelter as soon as possible. As every other character leaves the stage, Aeneas is stopped by the Sorceress's elf, who is disguised as Mercury. This pretend Mercury brings the command of Jove that Aeneas is to wait no longer in beginning his task of creating a new Troy on Latin soil. Aeneas consents to the wishes of what he believes are the gods, but is heart-broken that he will have to leave Dido. He then goes off-stage to prepare for his departure from Carthage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe harbour at Carthage\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparations are being made for the departure of the Trojan fleet. The sailors sing a song, which is followed shortly by the Sorceress and her companions' sudden appearance. The group is pleased at how well their plan has worked, and the Sorceress sings a solo describing her further plans for the destruction of Aeneas \\"on the ocean\\". All the characters begin to clear the stage after a dance in three sections, and then disperse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe palace\\r\\n\\r\\nDido and Belinda enter, shocked at Aeneas disappearance. Dido is distraught and Belinda comforts her. Suddenly Aeneas returns, but Dido is full of fear before Aeneas speaks, and his words only serve to confirm her suspicions. She derides his reasons for leaving, and even when Aeneas says he will defy the gods and not leave Carthage, Dido rejects him for having once thought of leaving her. After Dido forces Aeneas to leave, she states that \\"Death must come when he is gone.\\" The opera and Dido's life both slowly come to a conclusion, as the Queen of Carthage sings her last aria, \\"When I am laid in Earth\\", also known as \\"Dido's Lament.\\" The chorus and orchestra then conclude the opera once Dido is dead by ordering the \\"cupids to scatter roses on her tomb, soft and gentle as her heart. Keep here your watch, and never, never part.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first complete recording of the opera was made by Decca Records in 1935 with Nancy Evans as Dido and Roy Henderson as Aeneas,[30] followed in 1945 by HMV's release with Joan Hammond and Dennis Noble. Kirsten Flagstad, who had sung the role at the Mermaid Theatre in London, recorded it in 1951 for EMI with Thomas Hemsley as Aeneas. Dido and Aeneas has been recorded many times since the 1960s with Dido sung by mezzo-sopranos such as Janet Baker (1961), Tatiana Troyanos (1968), Teresa Berganza (1986), Anne Sofie von Otter (1989) and Susan Graham (2003). In addition to Joan Hammond and Kirsten Flagstad, sopranos who have recorded the role include Victoria de los ngeles (1965), Emma Kirkby (1981), Jessye Norman (1986), Catherine Bott (1992), Lynne Dawson (1998), and Evelyn Tubb (2004).\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with Andrew Parrott's 1981 recording for Chandos with the Taverner Consort and Players, there was an increasing preference for a more genuine period sound.[31] Further recordings by conductors and ensembles using this approach include those by Christopher Hogwood and The Academy of Ancient Music, William Christie and Les Arts Florissants (1986); Trevor Pinnock and The English Concert (1989); Ren Jacobs and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (1998); Emmanuelle Ha?m and Le Concert d'Astre (2003); and Predrag Gosta and New Trinity Baroque (2004). The Ha?m recording with Susan Graham as Dido and Ian Bostridge as Aeneas was nominated for the Best Opera Recording in the 2005 Grammy Awards.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral performances of the opera have been filmed and are available on DVD, most recently the 2008 performance at the Opra-Comique in Paris conducted by William Christie and directed by Deborah Warner (FRA Musica FRA001)[33] and the 2009 performance at London's Royal Opera House conducted by Christopher Hogwood and directed by Wayne McGregor (OpusArte OA1018D). The Mark Morris dance version of the opera is also preserved on DVD (recorded 1995, Image Entertainment 8741) as is the dance version by Sasha Waltz (recorded 2005, Arthaus Musik 101311). Leopold Stokowski made a string orchestra arrangement of \\"Dido's Lament\\" and in addition to his own recordings, others who have recorded it include Matthias Bamert, Jose Serebrier, Richard Egarr and Iona Brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\r\\nSources","input":"What was the source for dido and aeneas?"},{"output":"hematite","context":"Iron ores[1] are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted.  The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe2O3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH){n(H2O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO3, 48.2% Fe).\\r\\n\\r\\nOres containing very high quantities of hematite or magnetite (greater than about 60% iron) are known as \\"natural ore\\" or \\"direct shipping ore\\", meaning they can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces. Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron, which is one of the main raw materials to make steel98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel.[2] Indeed, it has been argued that iron ore is \\"more integral to the global economy than any other commodity, except perhaps oil\\".[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMetallic iron is virtually unknown on the surface of the Earth except as iron-nickel alloys from meteorites and very rare forms of deep mantle xenoliths. Although iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, comprising about 5%, the vast majority is bound in silicate or more rarely carbonate minerals. The thermodynamic barriers to separating pure iron from these minerals are formidable and energy intensive, therefore all sources of iron used by human industry exploit comparatively rarer iron oxide minerals, primarily hematite.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the industrial revolution, most iron was obtained from widely available goethite or bog ore, for example during the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Prehistoric societies used laterite as a source of iron ore. Historically, much of the iron ore utilized by industrialized societies has been mined from predominantly hematite deposits with grades of around 70% Fe. These deposits are commonly referred to as \\"direct shipping ores\\" or \\"natural ores\\". Increasing iron ore demand, coupled with the depletion of high-grade hematite ores in the United States, after World War II led to development of lower-grade iron ore sources, principally the utilization of magnetite and taconite. \\r\\n\\r\\nIron-ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined. There are four main types of iron-ore deposits worked currently, depending on the mineralogy and geology of the ore deposits. These are magnetite, titanomagnetite, massive hematite and pisolitic ironstone deposits.\\r\\n\\r\\nBanded iron formations (BIFs) are sedimentary rocks containing more than 15% iron composed predominantly of thinly bedded iron minerals and silica (as quartz). Banded iron formations occur exclusively in Precambrian rocks, and are commonly weakly to intensely metamorphosed. Banded iron formations may contain iron in carbonates (siderite or ankerite) or silicates (minnesotaite, greenalite, or grunerite), but in those mined as iron ores, oxides (magnetite or hematite) are the principal iron mineral.[4]  Banded iron formations are known as taconite within North America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mining involves moving tremendous amounts of ore and waste.  The waste comes in two forms, non-ore bedrock in the mine (overburden or interburden locally known as mullock), and unwanted minerals which are an intrinsic part of the ore rock itself (gangue). The mullock is mined and piled in waste dumps, and the gangue is separated during the beneficiation process and is removed as tailings. Taconite tailings are mostly the mineral quartz, which is chemically inert.  This material is stored in large, regulated water settling ponds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key economic parameters for magnetite ore being economic are the crystallinity of the magnetite, the grade of the iron within the banded iron formation host rock, and the contaminant elements which exist within the magnetite concentrate. The size and strip ratio of most magnetite resources is irrelevant as a banded iron formation can be hundreds of meters thick, extend hundreds of kilometers along strike, and can easily come to more than three billion or more tonnes of contained ore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe typical grade of iron at which a magnetite-bearing banded iron formation becomes economic is roughly 25% iron, which can generally yield a 33% to 40% recovery of magnetite by weight, to produce a concentrate grading in excess of 64% iron by weight. The typical magnetite iron-ore concentrate has less than 0.1% phosphorus, 3ÿ7% silica and less than 3% aluminium.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently magnetite iron ore is mined in Minnesota and Michigan in the U.S., Eastern Canada and Northern Sweden. Magnetite bearing banded iron formation is currently mined extensively in Brazil, which exports significant quantities to Asia, and there is a nascent and large magnetite iron-ore industry in Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirect-shipping iron-ore (DSO) deposits (typically composed of hematite) are currently exploited on all continents except Antarctica, with the largest intensity in South America, Australia and Asia. Most large hematite iron-ore deposits are sourced from altered banded iron formations and rarely igneous accumulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nDSO deposits are typically rarer than the magnetite-bearing BIF or other rocks which form its main source or protolith rock, but are considerably cheaper to mine and process as they require less beneficiation due to the higher iron content.  However, DSO ores can contain significantly higher concentrations of penalty elements, typically being higher in phosphorus, water content (especially pisolite sedimentary accumulations) and aluminum (clays within pisolites). Export grade DSO ores are generally in the 62ÿ64% Fe range.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally granite and ultrapotassic igneous rocks segregate magnetite crystals and form masses of magnetite suitable for economic concentration. A few iron ore deposits, notably in Chile, are formed from volcanic flows containing significant accumulations of magnetite phenocrysts.[5] Chilean magnetite iron ore deposits within the Atacama Desert have also formed alluvial accumulations of magnetite in streams leading from these volcanic formations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome magnetite skarn and hydrothermal deposits have been worked in the past as high-grade iron ore deposits requiring little beneficiation. There are several granite-associated deposits of this nature in Malaysia and Indonesia.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther sources of magnetite iron ore include metamorphic accumulations of massive magnetite ore such as at Savage River, Tasmania, formed by shearing of ophiolite ultramafics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother, minor, source of iron ores are magmatic accumulations in layered intrusions which contain a typically titanium-bearing magnetite often with vanadium. These ores form a niche market, with specialty smelters used to recover the iron, titanium and vanadium. These ores are beneficiated essentially similar to banded iron formation ores, but usually are more easily upgraded via crushing and screening. The typical titanomagnetite concentrate grades 57% Fe, 12% Ti and 0.5% V2O5.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high quality fine ore powders, are known as fines.\\r\\n\\r\\nMagnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and capable of producing a high-grade concentrate with very low levels of impurities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grain size of the magnetite and its degree of commingling with the silica groundmass determine the grind size to which the rock must be comminuted to enable efficient magnetic separation to provide a high purity magnetite concentrate. This determines the energy inputs required to run a milling operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMining of banded iron formations involves coarse crushing and screening, followed by rough crushing and fine grinding to comminute the ore to the point where the crystallized magnetite and quartz are fine enough that the quartz is left behind when the resultant powder is passed under a magnetic separator.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally most magnetite banded iron formation deposits must be ground to between 32 and 45 micrometers in order to produce a low-silica magnetite concentrate. Magnetite concentrate grades are generally in excess of 70% iron by weight and usually are low phosphorus, low aluminium, low titanium and low silica and demand a premium price.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the high density of hematite relative to associated silicate gangue, hematite beneficiation usually involves a combination of beneficiation techniques.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne method relies on passing the finely crushed ore over a slurry containing magnetite or other agent such as ferrosilicon which increases its density. When the density of the slurry is properly calibrated, the hematite will sink and the silicate mineral fragments will float and can be removed.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIron is the world's most commonly used metal - steel, of which iron ore is the key ingredient, representing almost 95% of all metal used per year.[3] It is used primarily in structural engineering applications and in maritime purposes, automobiles, and general industrial applications (machinery).\\r\\n\\r\\nIron-rich rocks are common worldwide, but ore-grade commercial mining operations are dominated by the countries listed in the table aside. The major constraint to economics for iron ore deposits is not necessarily the grade or size of the deposits, because it is not particularly hard to geologically prove enough tonnage of the rocks exist. The main constraint is the position of the iron ore relative to market, the cost of rail infrastructure to get it to market and the energy cost required to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nMining iron ore is a high volume low margin business, as the value of iron is significantly lower than base metals.[10] It is highly capital intensive, and requires significant investment in infrastructure such as rail in order to transport the ore from the mine to a freight ship.[10] For these reasons, iron ore production is concentrated in the hands of a few major players.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld production averages two billion metric tons of raw ore annually. The world's largest producer of iron ore is the Brazilian mining corporation Vale, followed by Anglo-Australian companies Rio Tinto Group and then BHP Billiton. A further Australian supplier, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd, has helped bring Australia's production to first in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seaborne trade in iron ore, that is, iron ore to be shipped to other countries, was 849m tonnes in 2004.[10] Australia and Brazil dominate the seaborne trade, with 72% of the market.[10] BHP, Rio and Vale control 66% of this market between them.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia iron ore is won from three main sources: pisolite \\"channel iron deposit\\" ore derived by mechanical erosion of primary banded-iron formations and accumulated in alluvial channels such as at Pannawonica, Western Australia; and the dominant metasomatically-altered banded iron formation related ores such as at Newman, the Chichester Range, the Hamersley Range and Koolyanobbing, Western Australia. Other types of ore are coming to the fore recently, such as oxidised ferruginous hardcaps, for instance laterite iron ore deposits near Lake Argyle in Western Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total recoverable reserves of iron ore in India are about 9,602 million tonnes of hematite and 3,408 million tonnes of magnetite.[11] Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Odisha, Goa, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu are the principal Indian producers of iron ore. World consumption of iron ore grows 10% per annum[citation needed] on average with the main consumers being China, Japan, Korea, the United States and the European Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina is currently the largest consumer of iron ore, which translates to be the world's largest steel producing country. It is also the largest importer, buying 52% of the seaborne trade in iron ore in 2004.[10] China is followed by Japan and Korea, which consume a significant amount of raw iron ore and metallurgical coal. In 2006, China produced 588 million tons of iron ore, with an annual growth of 38%.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the last 40 years, iron ore prices have been decided in closed-door negotiations between the small handful of miners and steelmakers which dominate both spot and contract markets. Traditionally, the first deal reached between these two groups sets a benchmark to be followed by the rest of the industry.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, however, this benchmark system has begun to break down, with participants along both demand and supply chains calling for a shift to short term pricing. Given that most other commodities already have a mature market-based pricing system, it is natural for iron ore to follow suit.  To answer increasing market demands for more transparent pricing, a number of financial exchanges and/or clearing houses around the world have offered iron ore swaps clearing. The CME group, SGX (Singapore Exchange), London Clearing House (LCH.Clearnet), NOS Group and ICEX (Indian Commodities Exchange) all offer cleared swaps based on The Steel Index's (TSI) iron ore transaction data. The CME also offers a Platts-based swap, in addition to their TSI swap clearing. The ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) offers a Platts-based swap clearing service also. The swaps market has grown quickly, with liquidity clustering around TSI's pricing.[12] By April 2011, over US$5.5 billion worth of iron ore swaps have been cleared basis TSI prices. By August 2012, in excess of one million tonnes of swaps trading per day was taking place regularly, basis TSI.\\r\\n\\r\\nA relatively new development has also been the introduction of iron ore options, in addition to swaps. The CME group has been the venue most utilised for clearing of options written against TSI, with open interest at over 12,000 lots in August 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nSingapore Mercantile Exchange (SMX) has launched the world first global iron ore futures contract, based on the Metal Bulletin Iron Ore Index (MBIOI) which utilizes daily price data from a broad spectrum of industry participants and independent Chinese steel consultancy and data provider Shanghai Steelhome's widespread contact base of steel producers and iron ore traders across China.[13] The futures contract has seen monthly volumes over 1.5 million tonnes after eight months of trading.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis move follows a switch to index-based quarterly pricing by the world's three largest iron ore miners - Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP - in early 2010, breaking a 40-year tradition of benchmark annual pricing.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iron ore reserves at present seem quite vast, but some are starting to suggest that the math of continual exponential increase in consumption can even make this resource seem quite finite. For instance, Lester Brown of the Worldwatch Institute has suggested iron ore could run out within 64 years based on an extremely conservative extrapolation of 2% growth per year.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeoscience Australia calculates that the country's \\"economic demonstrated resources\\" of iron  currently amount to 24 gigatonnes, or 24 billion tonnes.[citation needed]  The current production rate from the Pilbara region of Western Australia is approximately 430 million tonnes a year and rising. Gavin Mudd (Monash University) and Jonathon Law (CSIRO) expect it to be gone within 30 to 50 years (Mudd) and 56 years (Law).[17] These estimates require on-going review to take into account shifting demand for lower grade iron ore and improving mining and recovery techniques (allowing deeper mining below the groundwater table).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, leading Pilbara-based iron ore miners ÿ Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) ÿ all announced significant capital investment in the development of existing and new mines and associated infrastructure (rail and port). Collectively this would amount to the production of 1,000 million tonnes per year (Mt/y) by 2020. Practically that would require a doubling of production capacity from a current[when?] production level of 470?Mt/y to 1,000?Mt/y (an increase of 530 Mt/y). These figures are based on the current[when?] production rates of Rio 300 Mt/y, BHP 240 Mt/y, FMG 55 Mt/y and Other 15 Mt/y increasing to Rio 360 Mt/y, BHP 356 Mt/y, FMG 155 Mt/y and Other 140 Mt/y (the latter 140 Mt/y is based on planned production from recent[when?] industry entrants Hancock, Atlas and Brockman through Port Hedland and API and others through the proposed Port of Anketell). In March 2014, Fortescue officially opened its 40 million-tonne per annum (mtpa) Kings Valley project, marking the completion of a US$9.2 billion expansion that increased its production capacity to 155?mtpa. The expansion included the construction of the greenfields Solomon Hub in the Hamersley Ranges, one of the worlds largest iron ore developments comprising Kings Valley and the nearby 20?mtpa Firetail mine; an expansion of the Christmas Creek mine to 50?mtpa; and major extensions of Fortescues world-class port and rail facilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nA production rate of 1,000?Mt/y would require a significant increase in production from existing mines and the opening of a significant number of new mines. Further, a significant increase in the capacity of rail and port infrastructure would also be required. For example, Rio would be required to expand its port operations at Dampier and Cape Lambert by 140?Mt/y (from 220 Mt/y to 360 Mt/y). BHP would be required to expand its Port Hedland port operations by 180 Mt/y (from 180 Mt/y to 360 Mt/y). FMG would be required to expand its port operations at Port Hedland by 100 Mt/y (from 55 Mt/y to 155 Mt/y). That is an increase of 420 Mt/y in port capacity by the three majors Rio, BHP and FMG and about at least 110 Mt/y from the non-major producers. Based on the rule-of-thumb of 50 Mt/y per car dumper, reclaimer and ship-loader the new production would require approximately 10 new car dumpers, reclaimers and ship-loaders.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew rail capacity would also be required. Based on the rule-of-thumb of 100 Mt/y per rail line, increasing production by approximately 500 Mt/y would require five new single rail lines. One scenario is an extra rail line for all the majors: BHP (from double to triple track), Rio (double to triple track), FMG (single to double track) and at least two new lines. Hancock Prospecting has recently[when?] started production from its Roy Hill Iron Ore Mine located north of Newman. This project included the development of the Roy Hill deposit, the construction of a 344?km railway and a port facility with an annual throughput of 55?Mt and QR National to service non-major producers, as of December 2015 due to the falling iron ore price these plans have been suspended indefinitely.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1,000 Mt/y production rate needs to be further considered by proponents and government. Areas of further consideration include new port space at Anketell to service the West Pilbara mines, growth at Port Hedland (BHP has announced the development of an outer harbour at Port Hedland), rail rationalisation and the regulatory approval requirements for opening and maintaining a ground disturbance footprint that supports 1,000 Mt/y of production including, amongst other things, native title, aboriginal heritage and environmental protection outcomes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIron ores consist of oxygen and iron atoms bonded together into molecules. To convert it to metallic iron it must be smelted or sent through a direct reduction process to remove the oxygen.  Oxygen-iron bonds are strong, and to remove the iron from the oxygen, a stronger elemental bond must be presented to attach to the oxygen. Carbon is used because the strength of a carbon-oxygen bond is greater than that of the iron-oxygen bond, at high temperatures. Thus, the iron ore must be powdered and mixed with coke, to be burnt in the smelting process.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it is not entirely as simple as that. Carbon monoxide is the primary ingredient of chemically stripping oxygen from iron. Thus, the iron and carbon smelting must be kept at an oxygen deficient (reducing) state to promote burning of carbon to produce CO not CO2. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe inclusion of even small amounts of some elements can have profound effects on the behavioral characteristics of a batch of iron or the operation of a smelter.  These effects can be both good and bad, some catastrophically bad.  Some chemicals are deliberately added such as flux which makes a blast furnace more efficient.  Others are added because they make the iron more fluid, harder, or give it some other desirable quality.  The choice of ore, fuel, and flux determine how the slag behaves and the operational characteristics of the iron produced. Ideally iron ore contains only iron and oxygen. In reality this is rarely the case. Typically, iron ore contains a host of elements which are often unwanted in modern steel.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilica (SiO2) is almost always present in iron ore.  Most of it is slagged off during the smelting process.  At temperatures above 1300?C some will be reduced and form an alloy with the iron.  The hotter the furnace, the more silicon will be present in the iron.  It is not uncommon to find up to 1.5% Si in European cast iron from the 16th to 18th centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major effect of silicon is to promote the formation of grey iron.  Grey iron is less brittle and easier to finish than white iron.  It is preferred for casting purposes for this reason.  Turner (1900, pp.?192ÿ197) reported that silicon also reduces shrinkage and the formation of blowholes, lowering the number of bad castings.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhosphorus (P) has four major effects on iron: increased hardness and strength, lower solidus temperature, increased fluidity, and cold shortness.  Depending on the use intended for the iron, these effects are either good or bad.  Bog ore often has a high phosphorus content (Gordon 1996, p.?57).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strength and hardness of iron increases with the concentration of phosphorus.  0.05% phosphorus in wrought iron makes it as hard as medium carbon steel.  High phosphorus iron can also be hardened by cold hammering.  The hardening effect is true for any concentration of phosphorus.  The more phosphorus, the harder the iron becomes and the more it can be hardened by hammering.  Modern steel makers can increase hardness by as much as 30%, without sacrificing shock resistance by maintaining phosphorus levels between 0.07 and 0.12%.  It also increases the depth of hardening due to quenching, but at the same time also decreases the solubility of carbon in iron at high temperatures.  This would decrease its usefulness in making blister steel (cementation), where the speed and amount of carbon absorption is the overriding consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe addition of phosphorus has a down side.  At concentrations higher than 0.2% iron becomes increasingly cold short, or brittle at low temperatures.  Cold short is especially important for bar iron.  Although bar iron is usually worked hot, its uses[example  needed] often require it to be tough, bendable, and resistant to shock at room temperature.  A nail that shattered when hit with a hammer or a carriage wheel that broke when it hit a rock would not sell well.[citation needed]  High enough concentrations of phosphorus render any iron unusable (Rostoker & Bronson 1990, p.?22).  The effects of cold shortness are magnified by temperature.  Thus, a piece of iron that is perfectly serviceable in summer, might become extremely brittle in winter.  There is some evidence that during the Middle Ages the very wealthy may have had a high phosphorus sword for summer and a low phosphorus sword for winter (Rostoker & Bronson 1990, p.?22).\\r\\n\\r\\nCareful control of phosphorus can be of great benefit in casting operations.  Phosphorus depresses the liquidus temperature, allowing the iron to remain molten for longer and increases fluidity.  The addition of 1% can double the distance molten iron will flow (Rostoker & Bronson 1990, p.?22).  The maximum effect, about 500?C, is achieved at a concentration of 10.2% (Rostocker & Bronson 1990, p.?194).  For foundry work Turner[who?] felt the ideal iron had 0.2ÿ0.55% phosphorus.  The resulting iron filled molds with fewer voids and also shrank less.  In the 19th century some producers of decorative cast iron used iron with up to 5% phosphorus.  The extreme fluidity allowed them to make very complex and delicate castings.  But, they could not be weight bearing, as they had no strength (Turner 1900, pp.?202ÿ204).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two remedies[according to whom?] for high phosphorus iron.  The oldest, and easiest, is avoidance.  If the iron that the ore produced was cold short, one[who?] would search for a new source of iron ore.  The second method involves oxidizing the phosphorus during the fining process by adding iron oxide.  This technique is usually associated with puddling in the 19th century, and may not have been understood earlier. For instance Isaac Zane, the owner of Marlboro Iron Works did not appear to know about it in 1772.  Given Zane's reputation[according to whom?] for keeping abreast of the latest developments, the technique was probably unknown to the ironmasters of Virginia and Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhosphorus is a deleterious contaminant because it makes steel brittle, even at concentrations of as little as 0.6%. Phosphorus cannot be easily removed by fluxing or smelting, and so iron ores must generally be low in phosphorus to begin with.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall amounts of aluminium (Al) are present in many ores including iron ore, sand and some limestones.  The former can be removed by washing the ore prior to smelting. Until the introduction of brick lined furnaces, the amount of aluminum contamination was small enough that it did not have an effect on either the iron or slag.  However, when brick began to be used for hearths and the interior of blast furnaces, the amount of aluminium contamination increased dramatically.  This was due to the erosion of the furnace lining by the liquid slag.\\r\\n\\r\\nAluminium is difficult to reduce.  As a result, aluminium contamination of the iron is not a problem.  However, it does increase the viscosity of the slag (Kato & Minowa 1969, p.?37 and Rosenqvist 1983, p.?311).  This will have a number of adverse effects on furnace operation.  The thicker slag will slow the descent of the charge, prolonging the process.  High aluminium will also make it more difficult to tap off the liquid slag.  At the extreme this could lead to a frozen furnace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a number of solutions to a high aluminium slag.  The first is avoidance; don't use ore or a lime source with a high aluminium content.  Increasing the ratio of lime flux will decrease the viscosity (Rosenqvist 1983, p.?311).\\r\\n\\r\\nSulfur (S) is a frequent contaminant in coal.  It is also present in small quantities in many ores, but can be removed by calcining.  Sulfur dissolves readily in both liquid and solid iron at the temperatures present in iron smelting.  The effects of even small amounts of sulfur are immediate and serious.  They were one of the first worked out by iron makers.  Sulfur causes iron to be red or hot short (Gordon 1996, p.?7).\\r\\n\\r\\nHot short iron is brittle when hot.  This was a serious problem as most iron used during the 17th and 18th century was bar or wrought iron.  Wrought iron is shaped by repeated blows with a hammer while hot.  A piece of hot short iron will crack if worked with a hammer.  When a piece of hot iron or steel cracks the exposed surface immediately oxidizes.  This layer of oxide prevents the mending of the crack by welding.  Large cracks cause the iron or steel to break up.  Smaller cracks can cause the object to fail during use.  The degree of hot shortness is in direct proportion to the amount of sulfur present.  Today iron with over 0.03% sulfur is avoided.\\r\\n\\r\\nHot short iron can be worked, but it has to be worked at low temperatures.  Working at lower temperatures requires more physical effort from the smith or forgeman.  The metal must be struck more often and harder to achieve the same result.  A mildly sulfur contaminated bar can be worked, but it requires a great deal more time and effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cast iron sulfur promotes the formation of white iron.  As little as 0.5% can counteract the effects of slow cooling and a high silicon content (Rostoker & Bronson 1990, p.?21).  White cast iron is more brittle, but also harder.  It is generally avoided, because it is difficult to work,  except in China where high sulfur cast iron, some as high as 0.57%, made with coal and coke, was used to make bells and chimes (Rostoker, Bronson & Dvorak 1984, p.?760).  According to Turner (1900, pp.?200), good foundry iron should have less than 0.15% sulfur.  In the rest of the world a high sulfur cast iron can be used for making castings, but will make poor wrought iron.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a number of remedies for sulfur contamination.  The first, and the one most used in historic and prehistoric operations, is avoidance.  Coal was not used in Europe (unlike China) as a fuel for smelting because it contains sulfur and therefore causes hot short iron.  If an ore resulted in hot short metal, ironmasters looked for another ore.  When mineral coal was first used in European blast furnaces in 1709 (or perhaps earlier), it was coked.  Only with the introduction of hot blast from 1829 was raw coal used.\\r\\n\\r\\nSulfur can be removed from ores by roasting and washing.  Roasting oxidizes sulfur to form sulfur dioxide which either escapes into the atmosphere or can be washed out.  In warm climates it is possible to leave pyritic ore out in the rain.  The combined action of rain, bacteria, and heat oxidize the sulfides to sulfuric acid and sulfates, which are water-soluble and leached out (Turner 1900, pp.?77). However, historically (at least), iron sulfide (iron pyrite FeS2), though a common iron mineral, has not been used as an ore for the production of iron metal.  Natural weathering was also used in Sweden.  The same process, at geological speed, results in the gossan limonite ores.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe importance attached to low sulfur iron is demonstrated by the consistently higher prices paid for the iron of Sweden, Russia, and Spain from the 16th to 18th centuries.  Today sulfur is no longer a problem. The modern remedy is the addition of manganese.  But, the operator must know how much sulfur is in the iron because at least five times as much manganese must be added to neutralize it.  Some historic irons display manganese levels, but most are well below the level needed to neutralize sulfur (Rostoker & Bronson 1990, p.?21). \\r\\n\\r\\nSulfide inclusion as manganese sulfide (MnS) can also be the cause of severe pitting corrosion problems in low-grade stainless steel such as AISI 304 steel.[21] [22] \\r\\nUnder oxidizing conditions and in the presence of moisture, when sulfide oxidizes it produces thiosulfate anions as intermediate species and because thiosulfate anion has a higher equivalent electromobility than chloride anion due to its double negative electrical charge, it promotes the pit growth.[23]  Indeed, the positive electrical charges born by Fe2+ cations released in solution by Fe oxidation on the anodic zone inside the pit must be quickly compensated / neutralised by negative charges brought by the electrokinetic migration of anions in the capillary pit. Some of the electrochemical processes occurring in a capillary pit are the same than these encountered in capillary electrophoresis. Higher the anion electrokinetic migration rate, higher the rate of pitting corrosion. Electrokinetic transport of ions inside the pit can be the rate limiting step in the pit growth rate.","input":"What type of iron ore found in india?"},{"output":"Sudanese Arabic","context":"Sudanese Arabic is the variety of Arabic spoken throughout Sudan. Some of the tribes in Sudan still have similar accents to the ones in Saudi Arabia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1889 the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain claimed that the Arabic spoken in Sudan was \\"a pure but archaic Arabic\\". The pronunciation of certain letters was like Hijazi, and not Egyptian, such as g being the pronunciation for the Arabic letter Qf and J being the pronunciation for Jim.[3]\\r\\nSudanese Arabic is distinct from Egyptian Arabic and does not share some of the characteristic properties of that dialect despite the overall similarity of the two dialects. Sudanese Arabic is more closely related to Hejazi Arabic[4]\\r\\nThe Arabic letter ? maintains an archaic pronunciation [?] in Sudanese[citation needed] (other dialects typically have [d?], [?] or [j], while Egyptian Arabic has []).\\r\\nSudanese Arabic also maintains an archaic rendering of qaf as [?] (Voiced uvular plosive) while Egyptian (like some other modern Urban dialects) renders it as [?]. The uvular rendering of qaf has been lost in nearly every other Arabic dialect and is also considered a relic.\\r\\nAlso peculiar to Sudanese is the quality of the Arabic vowel transliterated as u/; this is usually transliterated as o in materials on Sudanese because the sound ranges from ?~o rather than the typical ?~u.\\r\\nIn addition to differences in pronunciation, Sudanese Arabic also uses some different words when compared to Egyptian Arabic. For example, the interrogative pronoun \\"what\\" in Sudan is shinu rather than \\"eh\\" as in Egyptian Arabic.\\r\\nIn northern and central parts of Sudan, Sudanese colloquial Arabic has been influenced by the Nubian language, which in ancient times was the dominant language in Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan. Many of the agricultural and farming terms in Sudanese Arabic were adopted from Nubian.\\r\\nBecause of the varying influence of local languages in different parts of Sudan, there is considerable regional variation in Arabic spoken throughout the country. Sudanese Arabic typically refers to Arabic spoken mostly in central parts of Sudan. The other most commonly mentioned derivative of Sudanese Arabic is Juba Arabic, a pidgin of Arabic spoken in South Sudan, which is much more heavily influenced by other local languages.\\r\\nIn northern Sudan, greetings are typically extended, and involve multiple questions about the other person's health, their family etc. When greeting someone you know informally, it is common to begin with the word o, followed by the person's first name: , Khalafalla or , kf ya Khalafalla.\\r\\nFormal greetings often begin with the universal As-salm ?alaykom and the reply, Wa ?alaykom as-salm, an exchange common to Muslims everywhere. However, other greetings typical to Sudan include Izzyak (to men) or Izzyik (to women). A rather informal way to say \\"How are you\\", is Inta shadؐd? Inti shadؐda? \\"Are you well? (to a male and a female, respectively)\\", the response to which is usually al-Hamdo lillh \\"Praise God\\" assuming you are indeed feeling well, ma batal \\"not bad\\" or nosnos \\"half-half)\\" if feeling only okay or ta?ban showayya \\"a little tired\\" if not so well. Of course, there can be many other responses but these are used in everyday language.\\r\\nOther everyday greetings include kwayyis(a), alhamdulilah \\"Good, thanks to allah\\", Kf al-usra? \\"how is the family?\\" or kf al awld? \\"how are the children\\". For friends, the question Kf? can also be formed using the person's first name, prefixed by ya, for example; kf ya Ysif? \\"How are you, Joseph?\\". Another standard response in addition to al-hamdu lillh is Allh ybarik fik \\"God's blessing upon you\\". Additional greetings are appropriate for particular times and are standard in most varieties of Arabic, such as Sabh al-khr? / Sabh an-Nr.\\r\\nSudanese that know each other well will often use many of these greetings together, sometimes repeating themselves. It is also common to shake hands on first meeting, sometimes simultaneously slapping or tapping each other on the left shoulder before the handshake (particularly for good friends). Handshakes in Sudan can often last as long as greetings. A handshake between well-acquainted Sudanese will often be preceded by raising one's right hand and touching each other's left shoulder simultaneously before engaging in the handshake, all while exchanging verbal greetings.\\r\\nThe Sudanese Arabic word for \\"yes\\" depends on the tribe; aye is widely used, similar to the Scottish aye, although aywa or naam are also commonly used.","input":"What dialect of arabic is spoken in sudan?"},{"output":"24.47 days at the equator and almost 38 days at the poles","context":"Solar rotation varies with latitude because the Sun is composed of a gaseous plasma. The rate of rotation is observed to be fastest at the equator (latitude  = 0?), and to decrease as latitude increases. The solar rotation period is 24.47 days at the equator and almost 38 days at the poles. The differential rotation rate is usually described by the equation:\\r\\nwhere  is the angular velocity in degrees per day,  is the solar latitude and A, B, and C are constants. The values of A, B, and C differ depending on the techniques used to make the measurement, as well as the time period studied.[1] A current set of accepted average values[2] is:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the equator the solar rotation period is 24.47 days. This is called the sidereal rotation period, and should not be confused with the synodic rotation period of 26.24 days, which is the time for a fixed feature on the Sun to rotate to the same apparent position as viewed from Earth. The synodic period is longer because the Sun must rotate for a sidereal period plus an extra amount due to the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun. Note that astrophysical literature does not typically use the equatorial rotation period, but instead often uses the definition of a Carrington rotation: a synodic rotation period of 27.2753 days (or a sidereal period of 25.38 days). This chosen period roughly corresponds to rotation at a latitude of 26 deg, which is consistent with the typical latitude of sunspots and corresponding periodic solar activity. When the Sun is viewed from the \\"north\\" (above the Earth's northern pole) solar rotation is counterclockwise. For a person standing on the North Pole, sunspots would appear to move from left to right across the face of the Sun.\\r\\nBartels' Rotation Number is a serial count that numbers the apparent rotations of the sun as viewed from Earth, and is used to track certain recurring or shifting patterns of solar activity. For this purpose, each rotation has a length of exactly 27 days, close to the synodic Carrington rotation rate. Julius Bartels arbitrarily assigned rotation one day one to 8 February 1832. The serial number serves as a kind of calendar to mark the recurrence periods of solar and geophysical parameters.\\r\\nThe Carrington rotation is a system for comparing locations on the Sun over a period of time, allowing the following of sunspot groups or reappearance of eruptions at a later time.\\r\\nBecause the Solar rotation is variable with latitude, depth and time, any such system is necessarily arbitrary and only makes comparison meaningful over moderate periods of time. Solar rotation is arbitrarily taken to be 27.2753 days for the purpose of Carrington rotations. Each rotation of the Sun under this scheme is given a unique number called the Carrington Rotation Number, starting from November 9, 1853. (The Bartels Rotation Number[3] is a similar numbering scheme that uses a period of exactly 27 days and starts from February 8, 1832.)\\r\\nThe heliographic longitude of a solar feature conventionally refers to its angular distance relative to the central meridian, i.e. that which the Sun-Earth line defines. The \\"Carrington longitude\\" of the same feature refers it to an arbitrary fixed reference point of an imagined rigid rotation, as defined originally by Carrington.\\r\\nRichard Christopher Carrington determined the solar rotation rate from low latitude sunspots in the 1850s and arrived at 25.38 days for the sidereal rotation period. Sidereal rotation is measured relative to the stars, but because the Earth is orbiting the Sun, we see this period as 27.2753 days.\\r\\nIt is possible to construct a diagram with the longitude of sunspots horizontally and time vertically. The longitude is measured by the time of crossing the central meridian and based on the Carrington rotations. In each rotation, plotted under the preceding ones, most sunspots or other phenomena will reappear directly below the same phenomenon on the previous rotation. There may be slight drifts left or right over longer periods of time.\\r\\nThe Bartels \\"musical diagram\\" or the Condegram spiral plot are other techniques for expressing the approximate 27-day periodicity of various phenomena originating at the solar surface.\\r\\nThe rotation constants have been measured by measuring the motion of various features (\\"tracers\\") on the solar surface. The first and most widely used tracers are sunspots. Though sunspots had been observed since ancient times, it was only when the telescope came into use that they were observed to turn with the Sun, and thus the period of the solar rotation could be defined. The English scholar Thomas Harriot was probably the first to observe sunspots telescopically as evidenced by a drawing in his notebook dated December 8, 1610, and the first published observations (June 1611) entitled De Maculis in Sole Observatis, et Apparente earum cum Sole Conversione Narratio (\\"Narration on Spots Observed on the Sun and their Apparent Rotation with the Sun\\") were by Johannes Fabricius who had been systematically observing the spots for a few months and had noted also their movement across the solar disc. This can be considered the first observational evidence of the solar rotation. Christopher Scheiner (Rosa Ursine sive solis, book 4, part 2, 1630) was the first to measure the equatorial rotation rate of the Sun and noticed that the rotation at higher latitudes is slower, so he can be considered the discoverer of solar differential rotation.\\r\\nEach measurement gives a slightly different answer, yielding the above standard deviations (shown as +/-). St. John (1918) was perhaps the first to summarise the published solar rotation rates, and concluded that the differences in series measured in different years can hardly be attributed to personal observation or to local disturbances on the Sun, and are probably due to time variations in the rate of rotation, and Hubrecht (1915) was the first one to find that the two solar hemispheres rotate differently. A study of magnetograph data showed a synodic period in agreement with other studies of 26.24 days at the equator and almost 38 days at the poles.[4]\\r\\nUntil the advent of helioseismology, the study of wave oscillations in the Sun, very little was known about the internal rotation of the Sun. The differential profile of the surface was thought to extend into the solar interior as rotating cylinders of constant angular momentum.[5] Through helioseismology this is now known not to be the case and the rotation profile of the Sun has been found. On the surface the Sun rotates slowly at the poles and quickly at the equator. This profile extends on roughly radial lines through the solar convection zone to the interior. At the tachocline the rotation abruptly changes to solid-body rotation in the solar radiation zone.[6]","input":"What is the rotation speed of the sun?"},{"output":"645,911","context":"\\r\\nCoordinates: 413319N 935009W? / ?41.555147N 93.835831W? / 41.555147; -93.835831\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Des Moines metropolitan area, officially known as the Des MoinesÿWest Des Moines, IA Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), consists of five counties in central Iowa, United States: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison, and Guthrie.

There are various views on the existence and meaning of such rites. Many Christians consider the sacraments to be a visible symbol of the reality of God, as well as a means by which God enacts his grace. Many denominations, including the Anglican, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, and Reformed, hold to the definition of sacrament formulated by Augustine of Hippo: an outward sign of an inward grace that has been instituted by Jesus Christ.[1][2][3][4] Sacraments signify God's grace in a way that is outwardly observable to the participant.[4]\\r\\nThe Catholic Church recognises seven sacraments: Baptism, Reconciliation (Penance or Confession), Eucharist (or Holy Communion), Confirmation, Marriage, Holy Orders, and Anointing of the Sick.[4] The Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Church[5] also believe that there are seven major sacraments, but apply the corresponding Greek word, 翼? (mysterion) also to rites that in the Western tradition are called sacramentals and to other realities, such as the Church itself.[6][7] Many Protestant denominations, such as those within the Reformed tradition, identify two sacraments instituted by Christ, the Eucharist (or Holy Communion) and Baptism.[8] The Lutheran sacraments include these two, often adding Confession (and Absolution) as a third sacrament.[8][9] Anglican and Methodist teaching is that \\"there are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord\\", and that \\"those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel\\".[10][11] In the Community of Christ, a restorationist denomination with traditional Protestant theology, eight sacraments are recognized, including \\"baptism, confirmation, blessing of children, the Lord's Supper, ordination, marriage, the Evangelist Blessing, and administration to the sick.\\"[12]\\r\\nSome traditions do not observe any of the rites, or hold that they are simply reminders or commendable practices that do not impart actual gracenot sacraments but \\"ordinances\\" pertaining to certain aspects of the Christian faith.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English word \\"sacrament\\" is derived indirectly from the Ecclesiastical Latin sacrmentum, from Latin sacr (\\"hallow, consecrate\\"), from sacer (\\"sacred, holy\\"). This in turn is derived from the Greek New Testament word \\"mysterion\\". In Ancient Rome, the term meant a soldier's oath of allegiance, and also a sacred rite. Tertullian, a 3rd-century Christian writer, suggested that just as the soldier's oath was a sign of the beginning of a new life, so too was initiation into the Christian community through baptism and Eucharist.[14]\\r\\nRoman Catholic theology enumerates seven sacraments:[15] Baptism, Confirmation (Chrismation), Eucharist (Communion), Penance (Reconciliation)(Confession), Matrimony (Marriage), Holy Orders (ordination to the diaconate, priesthood, or episcopate) and Anointing of the Sick (before the Second Vatican Council generally called Extreme Unction). These seven sacraments were codified in the documents of the Council of Trent (1545-1563), which stated:\\r\\nCANON I.- If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New Law were not all instituted by Jesus Christ, our Lord; or that they are more, or less, than seven, to wit, Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Unction, Order, and Matrimony; or even that any one of these seven is not truly and properly a sacrament; let him be anathema.\\r\\n[...]\\r\\nCANON IV.- If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New Law are not necessary unto salvation, but superfluous; and that, without them, or without the desire thereof, men obtain of God, through faith alone, the grace of justification; -though all (the sacraments) are not necessary for every individual; let him be anathema.[16]\\r\\nDuring the Middle Ages, sacraments were recorded in Latin. Even after the Reformation, many ecclesiastical leaders continued using this practice into the 20th century. On occasion, Protestant ministers followed the same practice. Since W was not part of the Latin alphabet, scribes only used it when dealing with names or places. In addition, names were modified to fit a \\"Latin mold.\\" For instance, the name Joseph would be rendered as Iosephus or Josephus.[17]\\r\\nThe Catholic Church indicates that the sacraments are necessary for salvation, though not every sacrament is necessary for every individual. The Church applies this teaching even to the sacrament of baptism, the gateway to the other sacraments. It states that \\"Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament.\\"[18][19] But it adds: \\"God has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments\\",[18] and accordingly, \\"since Christ died for the salvation of all, those can be saved without Baptism who die for the faith (Baptism of blood). Catechumens and all those who, even without knowing Christ and the Church, still (under the impulse of grace) sincerely seek God and strive to do his will can also be saved without Baptism (Baptism of desire). The Church in her liturgy entrusts children who die without Baptism to the mercy of God.\\"[19]\\r\\nIn the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, \\"the sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. The visible rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and make present the graces proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in those who receive them with the required dispositions.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe Church teaches that the effect of the sacraments comes ex opere operato, by the very fact of being administered, regardless of the personal holiness of the minister administering it.[21] However, as indicated in this definition of the sacraments given by the Catechism of the Catholic Church, a recipient's own lack of proper disposition to receive the grace conveyed can block a sacrament's effectiveness in that person. The sacraments presuppose faith and through their words and ritual elements, nourish, strengthen and give expression to faith.[22]\\r\\nThough not every individual has to receive every sacrament, the Church affirms that, for believers as a whole, the sacraments are necessary for salvation, as the modes of grace divinely instituted by Christ himself.[23] Through each of them, Christ bestows that sacrament's particular grace, such as incorporation into Christ and the Church, forgiveness of sins, or consecration for a particular service.\\r\\nThe Eastern Orthodox tradition does not limit the number of sacraments to seven, holding that anything the Church does as Church is in some sense sacramental. However it recognizes these seven as \\"the major sacraments\\", which are completed by many other blessings and special services.[24][25] Some lists of the sacraments taken from the Church Fathers include the consecration of a church, monastic tonsure, and the burial of the dead.[26] More specifically, for the Eastern Orthodox the term \\"sacrament\\" is a term which seeks to classify something that may, according to Orthodox thought, be impossible to classify. The Orthodox communion's preferred term is \\"Sacred Mystery\\", and the Orthodox communion has refrained from attempting to determine absolutely the exact form, number and effect of the sacraments, accepting simply that these elements are unknowable to all except God. According to Orthodox thinking God touches mankind through material means such as water, wine, bread, oil, incense, candles, altars, icons, etc. How God does this is a mystery. On a broad level, the mysteries are an affirmation of the goodness of created matter, and are an emphatic declaration of what that matter was originally created to be.\\r\\nDespite this broad view, Orthodox divines do write about there being seven \\"principal\\" mysteries. On a specific level, while not systematically limiting the mysteries to seven, the most profound Mystery is the Eucharist or Synaxis, in which the partakers, by participation in the liturgy and receiving the consecrated bread and wine (understood to have become the body and blood of Christ) directly communicate with God. No claim is made to understand how exactly this happens. The Eastern Orthodox merely state: \\"This appears to in the form of bread and wine, but God has told me it is His Body and Blood. I will take what He says as a 'mystery' and not attempt to rationalize it to my limited mind\\".[27] The emphasis on mystery is characteristic of Orthodox theology, and is often called apophatic, meaning that any and all positive statements about God and other theological matters must be balanced by negative statements. For example, while it is correct and appropriate to say that \\"God exists\\", or even that \\"God is the only Being which truly exists\\", such statements must be understood to also convey the idea that God transcends what is usually meant by the term \\"to exist\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nThe seven sacraments are also accepted by Oriental Orthodoxy, including the Coptic Orthodox Church,[28][29] Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church,[30] and the Armenian Orthodox Church.[31]\\r\\nAnglican and Methodist sacramental theology reflects its dual roots in the Catholic tradition and the Protestant Reformation. The Catholic heritage is perhaps most strongly asserted in the importance Anglicanism and Methodism places on the sacraments as a means of grace and sanctification,[32] while the Reformed tradition has contributed a marked insistence on \\"lively faith\\" and \\"worthy reception\\". Anglican and Roman Catholic theologians participating in an Anglican/Roman Catholic Joint Preparatory Commission declared that they had \\"reached substantial agreement on the doctrine of the Eucharist\\".[33] Similarly, Methodist/Roman Catholic Dialogue has affirmed that \\"Methodists and Catholics affirm the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. This reality does not depend on the experience of the communicant, although it is only by faith that we become aware of Christs presence.\\"[34] The Catholic Church and the World Methodist Council jointly understand the word \\"sacrament\\" as referring not only to the sacraments considered here, but also to Christ and the Church.[35]\\r\\nArticle XXV of the Thirty-Nine Articles in Anglicanism and Article XVI of the Articles of Religion in Methodism[36] recognises only two sacraments (Baptism and the Supper of the Lord) since these are the only ones ordained by Christ in the Gospel. The article continues stating that \\"Those five commonly called Sacraments ... are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel ... but have not the like nature of Sacraments with Baptism and the Lord's Supper, for they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained by God.\\" These phrases have led to a debate as to whether the five are to be called sacraments or not. A recent author writes that the Anglican Church gives \\"sacramental value to the other five recognised by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches\\" but these \\"do not reveal those essential aspects of redemption to which Baptism and Communion point.\\"[37] Some Anglicans maintain that the use of \\"commonly\\" implies that the others can legitimately be called sacraments (perhaps more exactly \\"Sacraments of the Church\\" as opposed to \\"Sacraments of the Gospel\\"); others object that at the time the Articles were written \\"commonly\\" meant \\"inaccurately\\" and point out that the Prayer Book refers to the creeds \\"commonly called the Apostles' Creed\\" and the \\"Athanasian\\" where both attributions are historically incorrect.[38]\\r\\nAnglicans are also divided as to the effects of the sacraments.[39] Some hold views similar to the Roman Catholic ex opere operato theory, that is that when the outward ceremony is duly performed the inward grace is necessarily given unless the recipient puts some obstacle in the way (non ponere obicem).[39] Article XXVI (entitled Of the unworthiness of ministers which hinders not the effect of the Sacrament) states that the \\"ministration of the Word and Sacraments\\" is not done in the name of the minister, \\"neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by their wickedness,\\" since the sacraments have their effect \\"because of Christ's intention and promise, although they be ministered by evil men.\\" As in Roman Catholic theology, the worthiness or unworthiness of the recipient is of great importance. Article XXV in the Thirty-Nine Articles of Anglicanism and Article XVI in the Articles of Religion in Methodism states: \\"And in such only as worthily receive the [sacraments], they have a wholesome effect and operation: but they that receive them unworthily purchase to themselves damnation\\",[40] and Article XXVIII in Anglicanism's Thirty-Nine Articles (Article XVIII in Methodism's Articles of Religion) on the Lord's Supper affirms \\"to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ\\".[41] In the Exhortations of the Prayer Book rite, the worthy communicant is bidden to \\"prepare himself by examination of conscience, repentance and amendment of life and above all to ensure that he is in love and charity with his neighbours\\" and those who are not \\"are warned to withdraw\\".[42]\\r\\nThis particular question was fiercely debated in the 19th century arguments over Baptismal Regeneration.[43]\\r\\nLutherans hold that sacraments are sacred acts of divine institution.[44] Whenever they are properly administered by the use of the physical component commanded by God[45] along with the divine words of institution,[46] God is, in a way specific to each sacrament, present with the Word and physical component.[47] He earnestly offers to all who receive the sacrament[48] forgiveness of sins[49] and eternal salvation.[50] He also works in the recipients to get them to accept these blessings and to increase the assurance of their possession.[51]\\r\\nMelanchthon's Apology of the Augsburg Confession defines sacraments, according to the German text, as \\"outward signs and ceremonies that have God's command and have an attached divine promise of graces\\". His Latin text was shorter: \\"rites that have the command of God, and to which is added a promise of grace\\".[52] This strict definition narrowed the number of sacraments down to three: Holy Baptism, the Eucharist, and Holy Absolution, with the other four rites eliminated for not having the ability to forgive sin, although at least one or two have the command of God. Lutherans do not dogmatically define the exact number of sacraments.[53] In line with Luther's initial statement in his Large Catechism some Lutherans speak of only two sacraments,[54] Baptism and the Eucharist, although later in the same work he calls Confession and Absolution[55] \\"the third sacrament\\".[56] The definition of sacrament in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession lists Absolution as one of them.[57] It is important to note that although Lutherans do not consider the other four rites as sacraments, they are still retained and used in the Lutheran church (with the exception of Extreme Unction although some Lutheran churches do practice it [58]). Luther himself around the time of his marriage and afterwards became one of the greatest champions of Marriage (Holy Matrimony), and the other two (Confirmation and Ordination) were kept in the Lutheran Church for purposes of good order. Within Lutheranism, the sacraments are a Means of Grace, and, together with the Word of God, empower the Church for mission.[59]\\r\\nJohn Calvin defined a sacrament as an earthly sign associated with a promise from God. He accepted only two sacraments as valid under the new covenant: baptism and the Lord's Supper. He and all Reformed theologians following him completely rejected the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and the treatment of the Supper as a sacrifice. He also could not accept the Lutheran doctrine of sacramental union in which Christ was \\"in, with and under\\" the elements.\\r\\nThe Westminster Confession of Faith also limits the sacraments to baptism and the Lord's Supper. Sacraments are denoted \\"signs and seals of the covenant of grace.\\"[60] Westminster speaks of \\"a sacramental relation, or a sacramental union, between the sign and the thing signified; whence it comes to pass that the names and effects of the one are attributed to the other.\\"[61] Baptism is for infant children of believers as well as believers, as it is for all the Reformed except Baptists and some Congregationalists. Baptism admits the baptized into the visible church, and in it all the benefits of Christ are offered to the baptized.[60] On the Lord's supper, Westminster takes a position between Lutheran sacramental union and Zwinglian memorialism: \\"the Lord's supper really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually, receive and feed upon Christ crucified, and all benefits of his death: the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally in, with, or under the bread and wine; yet, as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of believers in that ordinance as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.\\"[62]\\r\\nMembers of the Latter Day Saint movement often use the word \\"ordinance\\" in the place of the word \\"sacrament\\", but the actual theology is sacramental in nature.[63] Latter-Day Saint ordinances are understood as conferring an invisible form of grace of a saving nature and are required for salvation and exaltation. Latter-Day Saints often use the word \\"sacrament\\" to refer specifically to the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, also knowns as the Lord's Supper, in which participants eat bread and drink wine (or water, since the late 1800s) as tokens of the flesh and blood of Christ [2]. In Latter Day Saint congregations, the sacrament is normally provided every Sunday as part of the sacrament meeting and, like other Latter-Day Saint ordinances such as baptism and confirmation, is considered an essential and sacred rite.[64][63] Latter-Day Saint ordinances which are considered \\"saving\\" include Baptism, Confirmation, Sacrament of the Lord's Supper (Eucharist), Ordination (for males), Initiatory (called Chrismation in other Christian Traditions) and Endowment, and Marriage [3].\\r\\nThe enumeration, naming, understanding, and the adoption of the sacraments formally vary according to denomination, although the finer theological distinctions are not always understood and may not even be known to many of the faithful. Many Protestants and other post-Reformation traditions affirm Luther's definition and have only Baptism and Eucharist (or Communion or the Lord's Supper) as sacraments, while others see the ritual as merely symbolic, and still others do not have a sacramental dimension at all.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn addition to the traditional seven sacraments, other rituals have been considered sacraments by some Christian traditions. In particular, foot washing as seen in Anabaptist, Schwarzenau Brethren, German Baptist groups or True Jesus Church,[65] and the hearing of the Gospel, as understood by a few Christian groups (such as the Polish National Catholic Church of America[66]), have been considered sacraments by some churches. The Assyrian Church of the East holds the Holy Leaven and the sign of the cross as sacraments.[67]\\r\\nSince some post-Reformation denominations do not regard clergy as having a classically sacerdotal or priestly function, they avoid the term \\"sacrament\\", preferring the terms \\"sacerdotal function\\", \\"ordinance\\", or \\"tradition\\". This belief invests the efficacy of the ordinance in the obedience and participation of the believer and the witness of the presiding minister and the congregation. This view stems from a highly developed concept of the priesthood of all believers. In this sense, the believer himself or herself performs the sacerdotal role.[citation needed]\\r\\nBaptists and Pentecostals, among other Christian denominations, use the word ordinance, rather than sacrament because of certain sacerdotal ideas connected, in their view, with the word sacrament.[68] These churches argue that the word ordinance points to the ordaining authority of Christ which lies behind the practice.\\r\\nSome denominations do not have a sacramental dimension (or equivalent) at all. The Salvation Army does not practice formal sacraments for a variety of reasons, including a belief that it is better to concentrate on the reality behind the symbols; however, it does not forbid its members from receiving sacraments in other denominations.[69]\\r\\nThe Quakers (Religious Society of Friends) also do not practice formal sacraments, believing that all activities should be considered holy. Rather, they are focused on an inward transformation of one's whole life. Some Quakers use the words \\"Baptism\\" and \\"Communion\\" to describe the experience of Christ's presence and his ministry in worship.[70]\\r\\nThe Clancularii were an Anabaptist group in the 16th century who reasoned that because religion was seated in the heart, there was no need of any outward expression through the sacraments.[71]","input":"How many sacraments are there in the eastern orthodox church?"},{"output":"\\"C?dmon's Hymn\\"","context":"Old English literature or Anglo-Saxon literature, encompasses literature written in Old English, in Anglo-Saxon England from the 7th century to the decades after the Norman Conquest of 1066. \\"C?dmon's Hymn\\", composed in the 7th century, according to Bede, is often considered the oldest extant poem in English, whereas the later poem, The Grave is one of the final poems written in Old English, and presents a transitional text between Old and Middle English.[1] The Peterborough Chronicle can also be considered a late-period text, continuing into the 12th century.\\r\\nThe poem Beowulf, which often begins the traditional canon of English literature, is the most famous work of Old English literature. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has also proven significant for historical study, preserving a chronology of early English history.\\r\\nIn descending order of quantity, Old English literature consists of: sermons and saints' lives; biblical translations; translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers; Anglo-Saxon chronicles and narrative history works; laws, wills and other legal works; practical works on grammar, medicine, geography; and poetry.[2] In all there are over 400 surviving manuscripts from the period, of which about 189 are considered \\"major\\".[3]\\r\\nBesides Old English literature, Anglo-Saxons wrote a number of Anglo-Latin works.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOld English literature has gone through different periods of research; in the 19th and early 20th centuries the focus was on the Germanic and pagan roots that scholars thought they could detect in Old English literature.[4] Later, on account of the work of Bernard F. Hupp,[5] the influence of Augustinian exegesis was emphasised.[6] Today, along with a focus upon paleography and the physical manuscripts themselves more generally, scholars debate such issues as dating, place of origin, authorship, and the connections between Anglo-Saxon culture and the rest of Europe in the Middle Ages, and literary merits.\\r\\nA large number of manuscripts remain from the Anglo-Saxon period, with most written during its last 300?years (9th to 11th centuries).\\r\\nManuscripts written in both Latin and the vernacular remain. It is believed that Irish missionaries are responsible for the scripts used in early Anglo-Saxon texts, which include the Insular half-uncial (important Latin texts) and Insular minuscule (both Latin and the vernacular). In the 10th century, the Caroline minuscule was adopted for Latin, however the Insular minuscule continued to be used for Old English texts. Thereafter, it was increasingly influenced by Caroline minuscule, while retaining certain distinctively Insular letter-forms.[7]\\r\\nThere were considerable losses of manuscripts as a result of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century.[2] Scholarly study of the language began when the manuscripts were collected by scholars and antiquarians such as Matthew Parker, Laurence Nowell and Sir Robert Bruce Cotton.[8]\\r\\nOld English manuscripts have been highly prized by collectors since the 16th century, both for their historic value and for their aesthetic beauty with their uniformly spaced letters and decorative elements.[2]\\r\\nThere are four major poetic manuscripts:\\r\\nSeven major scriptoria produced a good deal of Old English manuscripts: Winchester; Exeter; Worcester; Abingdon; Durham; and two Canterbury houses, Christ Church and St. Augustine's Abbey.[10] In addition, some Old English text survives on stone structures and other ornate objects.[2]\\r\\nRegional dialects include: Northumbrian; Mercian; Kentish; and West dialect, leading to the speculation that much of the poetry may have been translated into West Saxon at a later date.[11] An example of the dominance of the West Saxon dialect is a pair of charters, from the Stowe and British Museum collections, which outline grants of land in Kent and Mercia, but are nonetheless written in the West Saxon dialect of the period. [12]\\r\\nEarly English manuscripts often contain later annotations in the margins of the texts; it is a rarity to find a completely unannotated manuscript. These include corrections, alterations and expansions of the main text, as well as commentary upon it, and even unrelated texts.[13][14] The majority of these annotations appear to date to the 13th century and later.[15]\\r\\nOld English poetry falls broadly into two styles or fields of reference, the heroic Germanic and the Christian. Almost all Old English poets are anonymous.\\r\\nAlthough there are Anglo-Saxon discourses on Latin prosody, the rules of Old English verse are understood only through modern analysis of the extant texts. The first widely accepted theory was constructed by Eduard Sievers (1893), who distinguished five distinct alliterative patterns.[16] His system of alliterative verse is based on accent, alliteration, the quantity of vowels, and patterns of syllabic accentuation. It consists of five permutations on a base verse scheme; any one of the five types can be used in any verse. The system was inherited from and exists in one form or another in all of the older Germanic languages. Two poetic figures commonly found in Old English poetry are the kenning, an often formulaic phrase that describes one thing in terms of another (e.g. in Beowulf, the sea is called the whale road) and litotes, a dramatic understatement employed by the author for ironic effect.[16] Alternative theories have been proposed, such as the theory of John C. Pope (1942), which uses musical notation to track the verse patterns.[17] J. R. R. Tolkien describes and illustrates many of the features of Old English poetry in his 1940 essay \\"On Translating Beowulf\\".[18]\\r\\nEven though all extant Old English poetry is written and literate, it is assumed that Old English poetry was an oral craft that was performed by a scop and accompanied by a harp.\\r\\nMost Old English poems are recorded without authors, and very few names are known with any certainty; the primary three are C?dmon, Aldhelm, and Cynewulf.[19]\\r\\nC?dmon is considered the first Old English poet whose work still survives. According to the account in Bede's Historia ecclesiastica, he was first a herdsman before living as a monk at the abbey of Whitby in Northumbria in the 7th century.[19][20] Only his first poem, comprising nine-lines, C?dmon's Hymn, remains, in Northumbrian, West-Saxon and Latin versions that appear in 19 surviving manuscripts:[21]\\r\\nCynewulf has proven to be a difficult figure to identify, but recent research suggests he was an Anglian poet from the early part of the 9th century. Four poems are attributed to him, signed with a runic acrostic at the end of each poem; these are The Fates of the Apostles and Elene (both found in the Vercelli Book), and Christ II and Juliana (both found in the Exeter Book).[24]\\r\\nAlthough William of Malmesbury claims that Aldhelm, bishop of Sherborne (d. 709), performed secular songs while accompanied by a harp, none of these Old English poems survives.[24] Paul G. Remely has recently proposed that the Old English Exodus may have been the work of Aldhelm, or someone closely associated with him.[25]\\r\\nBede is often thought to be the poet of a five-line poem entitled Bede's Death Song, on account of its appearance in a letter on his death by Cuthbert. This poem exists in a Northumbrian and later version.[26]\\r\\nAlfred is said to be the author of some of the metrical prefaces to the Old English translations of Gregory's Pastoral Care and Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy. Alfred is also thought to be the author of 50 metrical psalms, but whether the poems were written by him, under his direction or patronage, or as a general part in his reform efforts is unknown.[27]\\r\\nThe hypotheses of Milman Parry and Albert Lord on the Homeric Question came to be applied (by Parry and Lord, but also by Francis Magoun) to verse written in Old English. That is, the theory proposes that certain features of at least some of the poetry may be explained by positing oral-formulaic composition. While Anglo-Saxon (Old English) epic poetry may bear some resemblance to Ancient Greek epics such as the Iliad and Odyssey, the question of if and how Anglo-Saxon poetry was passed down through an oral tradition remains a subject of debate, and the question for any particular poem unlikely to be answered with perfect certainty.\\r\\nParry and Lord had already demonstrated the density of metrical formulas in Ancient Greek, and observed that the same phenomenon was apparent in the Old English alliterative line:\\r\\nIn addition to verbal formulas, many themes have been shown to appear among the various works of Anglo-Saxon literature. The theory proposes to explain this fact by suggesting that the poetry was composed of formulae and themes from a stock common to the poetic profession, as well as literary passages composed by individual artists in a more modern sense. Larry Benson introduced the concept of \\"written-formulaic\\" to describe the status of some Anglo-Saxon poetry which, while demonstrably written, contains evidence of oral influences, including heavy reliance on formulas and themes.[28] Frequent oral-formulaic themes in Old English poetry include \\"Beasts of Battle\\"[29] and the \\"Cliff of Death\\".[30] The former, for example, is characterised by the mention of ravens, eagles, and wolves preceding particularly violent depictions of battle. Among the most thoroughly documented themes is \\"The Hero on the Beach\\". D. K. Crowne[31] first proposed this theme, defined by four characteristics:\\r\\nOne example Crowne cites in his article is that which concludes Beowulf's fight with the monsters during his swimming match with Breca:\\r\\nCrowne drew on examples of the theme's appearance in twelve Anglo-Saxon texts, including one occurrence in Beowulf. It was also observed in other works of Germanic origin, Middle English poetry, and even an Icelandic prose saga. John Richardson held that the schema was so general as to apply to virtually any character at some point in the narrative, and thought it an instance of the \\"threshold\\" feature of Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey monomyth. J.A. Dane, in an article[32] (characterised by Foley as \\"polemics without rigour\\"[33]) claimed that the appearance of the theme in Ancient Greek poetry, a tradition without known connection to the Germanic, invalidated the notion of \\"an autonomous theme in the baggage of an oral poet.\\" Foley's response was that Dane misunderstood the nature of oral tradition, and that in fact the appearance of the theme in other cultures showed that it was a traditional form.[34]\\r\\nThe Old English poetry which has received the most attention deals with the Germanic heroic past. The longest at 3,182 lines, and the most important, is Beowulf, which appears in the damaged Nowell Codex. Beowulf relates the exploits of the hero Beowulf, King of the Weder-Geats or Angles, around the middle of the 5th century. The author is unknown, and no mention of Britain occurs. Scholars are divided over the date of the present text, with hypotheses ranging from the 8th to the 11th centuries.[35][36] It has achieved much acclaim as well as sustained academic and artistic interest.[37]\\r\\nOther heroic poems besides Beowulf exist. Two have survived in fragments: The Fight at Finnsburh, controversially interpreted by many to be a retelling of one of the battle scenes in Beowulf, and Waldere, a version of the events of the life of Walter of Aquitaine. Two other poems mention heroic figures: Widsith is believed to be very old in parts, dating back to events in the 4th century concerning Eormanric and the Goths, and contains a catalogue of names and places associated with valiant deeds. Deor is a lyric, in the style of Consolation of Philosophy, applying examples of famous heroes, including Weland and Eormanric, to the narrator's own case.[24]\\r\\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle contains various heroic poems inserted throughout. The earliest from 937 is called The Battle of Brunanburh, which celebrates the victory of King Athelstan over the Scots and Norse. There are five shorter poems: capture of the Five Boroughs (942); coronation of King Edgar (973); death of King Edgar (975); death of Alfred the son of King ?thelred (1036); and death of King Edward the Confessor (1065).[24]\\r\\nThe 325 line poem The Battle of Maldon celebrates Earl Byrhtnoth and his men who fell in battle against the Vikings in 991. It is considered one of the finest, but both the beginning and end are missing and the only manuscript was destroyed in a fire in 1731.[38] A well-known speech is near the end of the poem:\\r\\nOld English heroic poetry was handed down orally from generation to generation. As Christianity began to appear, re-tellers often recast the tales of Christianity into the older heroic stories.\\r\\nRelated to the heroic tales are a number of short poems from the Exeter Book which have come to be described as \\"elegies\\"[40] or \\"wisdom poetry\\".[41][42] They are lyrical and Boethian in their description of the up and down fortunes of life. Gloomy in mood is The Ruin, which tells of the decay of a once glorious city of Roman Britain (cities in Britain fell into decline after the Romans departed in the early 5th century, as the early English continued to live their rural life), and The Wanderer, in which an older man talks about an attack that happened in his youth, where his close friends and kin were all killed; memories of the slaughter have remained with him all his life. He questions the wisdom of the impetuous decision to engage a possibly superior fighting force: the wise man engages in warfare to preserve civil society, and must not rush into battle but seek out allies when the odds may be against him. This poet finds little glory in bravery for bravery's sake. The Seafarer is the story of a somber exile from home on the sea, from which the only hope of redemption is the joy of heaven. Other wisdom poems include Wulf and Eadwacer, The Wife's Lament, and The Husband's Message. Alfred the Great wrote a wisdom poem over the course of his reign based loosely on the neoplatonic philosophy of Boethius called the Lays of Boethius.[43]\\r\\nSeveral Old English poems are adaptations of late classical philosophical texts. The longest is a 10th-century translation of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy contained in the Cotton manuscript Otho A.vi.[44] Another is The Phoenix in the Exeter Book, an allegorisation of the De ave phoenice by Lactantius.[45]\\r\\nOther short poems derive from the Latin bestiary tradition. Some examples include The Panther, The Whale and The Partridge.[45]\\r\\nAnglo-Saxon riddles are part of Anglo-Saxon literature. The most famous Anglo-Saxon riddles are found in the Exeter Book. This book contains secular and religious poems and other writings, along with a collection of 94 riddles, although there is speculation that there may have been closer to 100 riddles in the book. The riddles are written in a similar manner, but \\"it is unlikely that the whole collection was written by one person.\\"[46] It is more likely that many scribes worked on this collection of riddles. Although the Exeter Book has a unique and extensive collection of Anglo-Saxon riddles,[47] riddles were not uncommon during this era. Riddles were both comical and obscene.[46]\\r\\nThe Vercelli Book and Exeter Book contain four long narrative poems of saints' lives, or hagiography. In Vercelli are Andreas and Elene and in Exeter are Guthlac and Juliana.\\r\\nAndreas is 1,722 lines long and is the closest of the surviving Old English poems to Beowulf in style and tone. It is the story of Saint Andrew and his journey to rescue Saint Matthew from the Mermedonians. Elene is the story of Saint Helena (mother of Constantine) and her discovery of the True Cross. The cult of the True Cross was popular in Anglo-Saxon England and this poem was instrumental in promoting it.[48]\\r\\nGuthlac consists of two poems about the English 7th century Saint Guthlac. Juliana describes the life of Saint Juliana, including a discussion with the devil during her imprisonment.[48]\\r\\nThere are a number of partial Old English Bible translations and paraphrases surviving. The Junius manuscript contains three paraphrases of Old Testament texts. These were re-wordings of Biblical passages in Old English, not exact translations, but paraphrasing, sometimes into beautiful poetry in its own right. The first and longest is of Genesis (originally presented as one work in the Junius manuscript but now thought to consist of two separate poems, A and B), the second is of Exodus and the third is Daniel. Contained in Daniel are two lyrics, Song of the Three Children and Song of Azarias, the latter also appearing in the Exeter Book after Guthlac.[49] The fourth and last poem, Christ and Satan, which is contained in the second part of the Junius manuscript, does not paraphrase any particular biblical book, but retells a number of episodes from both the Old and New Testament.[50]\\r\\nThe Nowell Codex contains a Biblical poetic paraphrase, which appears right after Beowulf, called Judith, a retelling of the story of Judith. This is not to be confused with ?lfric's homily Judith, which retells the same Biblical story in alliterative prose.[45]\\r\\nOld English translations of Psalms 51-150 have been preserved, following a prose version of the first 50 Psalms.[45] There are verse translations of the Gloria in Excelsis, the Lord's Prayer, and the Apostles' Creed, as well as some hymns and proverbs.[43]\\r\\nIn addition to Biblical paraphrases are a number of original religious poems, mostly lyrical (non-narrative).[45]\\r\\nThe Exeter Book contains a series of poems entitled Christ, sectioned into Christ I, Christ II and Christ III.[45]\\r\\nConsidered one of the most beautiful of all Old English poems is Dream of the Rood, contained in the Vercelli Book.[45] The presence of a portion of the poem (in Northumbrian dialect[51]) carved in ruins on an 8th century stone cross found in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire, verifies the age of at least this portion of the poem. The Dream of the Rood is a dream vision in which the personified cross tells the story of the crucifixion. Christ appears as a young hero-king, confidant of victory, while the cross itself feels all the physical pain of the crucifixion, as well as the pain of being forced to kill the young lord.[52]\\r\\nThe dreamer resolves to trust in the cross, and the dream ends with a vision of heaven.\\r\\nThere are a number of religious debate poems. The longest is Christ and Satan in the Junius manuscript, it deals with the conflict between Christ and Satan during the forty days in the desert. Another debate poem is Solomon and Saturn, surviving in a number of textual fragments, Saturn is portrayed as a magician debating with the wise king Solomon.[45]\\r\\nOther poetic forms exist in Old English including short verses, gnomes, and mnemonic poems for remembering long lists of names.[43]\\r\\nThere are short verses found in the margins of manuscripts which offer practical advice, such as remedies against the loss of cattle or how to deal with a delayed birth, often grouped as charms. The longest is called Nine Herbs Charm and is probably of pagan origin. Other similar short verses, or charms, include For a Swarm of Bees, Against a Dwarf, Against a Stabbing Pain, and Against a Wen.[43]\\r\\nThere are a group of mnemonic poems designed to help memorise lists and sequences of names and to keep objects in order. These poems are named Menologium, The Fates of the Apostles, The Rune Poem, The Seasons for Fasting, and the Instructions for Christians.[43]\\r\\nAnglo-Saxon poetry is marked by the comparative rarity of similes. This is a particular feature of Anglo-Saxon verse style, and is a consequence both of its structure and of the rapidity with which images are deployed, to be unable to effectively support the expanded simile. As an example of this, Beowulf contains at best five similes, and these are of the short variety. This can be contrasted sharply with the strong and extensive dependence that Anglo-Saxon poetry has upon metaphor, particularly that afforded by the use of kennings. The most prominent example of this in The Wanderer is the reference to battle as a \\"storm of spears\\".[54] This reference to battle shows how Anglo-Saxons viewed battle: as unpredictable, chaotic, violent, and perhaps even a function of nature.\\r\\nOld English poetry traditionally alliterates, meaning that a sound (usually the initial consonant sound) is repeated throughout a line. For instance, in the first line of Beowulf, \\"Hwaet! We Gar-Dena | in gear-dagum\\",[55] (meaning \\"Lo! We ... of the Spear Danes in days of yore\\"), the stressed words Gar-Dena and gear-dagum alliterate on the consonant \\"G\\".\\r\\nThe Old English poet was particularly fond of describing the same person or object with varied phrases, (often appositives) that indicated different qualities of that person or object. For instance, the Beowulf poet refers in three and a half lines to a Danish king as \\"lord of the Danes\\" (referring to the people in general), \\"king of the Scyldings\\" (the name of the specific Danish tribe), \\"giver of rings\\" (one of the king's functions is to distribute treasure), and \\"famous chief\\". Such variation, which the modern reader (who likes verbal precision) is not used to, is frequently a difficulty in producing a readable translation.[56]\\r\\nOld English poetry, like other Old Germanic alliterative verse, is also commonly marked by the caesura or pause. In addition to setting pace for the line, the caesura also grouped each line into two couplets.\\r\\nThe amount of surviving Old English prose is much greater than the amount of poetry.[43] Of the surviving prose, the majority consists of the homilies, saints' lives and biblical translations from Latin.[2] The division of early medieval written prose works into categories of \\"Christian\\" and \\"secular\\", as below, is for convenience's sake only, for literacy in Anglo-Saxon England was largely the province of monks, nuns, and ecclesiastics (or of those laypeople to whom they had taught the skills of reading and writing Latin and/or Old English). Old English prose first appears in the 9th century, and continues to be recorded through the 12th century as the last generation of scribes, trained as boys in the standardised West Saxon before the Conquest, died as old men.[43]\\r\\nThe most widely known secular author of Old English was King Alfred the Great (849ÿ899), who translated several books, many of them religious, from Latin into Old English. Alfred, wanting to restore English culture, lamented the poor state of Latin education:\\r\\nSo general was [educational] decay in England there were very few on this side of the Humber who could...translate a letter from Latin into English; and I believe that there were not many beyond the Humber\\r\\nAlfred proposed that students be educated in Old English, and those who excelled should go on to learn Latin. Alfred's cultural program produced the following translations: Gregory the Great's The Pastoral Care, a manual for priests on how to conduct their duties; The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius; and The Soliloquies of Saint Augustine.[58] In the process, some original content was interweaved through the translations.[59]\\r\\nOther important[58] Old English translations include: Historiae adversum paganos by Orosius, a companion piece for St. Augustine's The City of God; the Dialogues of Gregory the Great; and Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People.[60]\\r\\n?lfric of Eynsham, who wrote in the late 10th and early 11th century, is believed to have been a pupil of ?thelwold.[43] He was the greatest and most prolific writer of Anglo-Saxon sermons,[58] which were copied and adapted for use well into the 13th century.[61] In the translation of the first six books of the Bible (Old English Hexateuch), portions have been assigned to ?lfric on stylistic grounds. He included some lives of the saints in the Catholic Homilies, as well as a cycle of saints' lives to be used in sermons. ?lfric also wrote an Old English work on time-reckoning, and pastoral letters.[61]\\r\\nIn the same category as ?lfric, and a contemporary, was Wulfstan II, archbishop of York. His sermons were highly stylistic. His best known work is Sermo Lupi ad Anglos in which he blames the sins of the English for the Viking invasions. He wrote a number of clerical legal texts Institutes of Polity and Canons of Edgar.[62]\\r\\nOne of the earliest Old English texts in prose is the Martyrology, information about saints and martyrs according to their anniversaries and feasts in the church calendar. It has survived in six fragments. It is believed to date from the 9th century by an anonymous Mercian author.[58]\\r\\nThe oldest collections of church sermons is the Blickling homilies, found in a 10th-century manuscript.[58]\\r\\nThere are a number of saint's lives prose works; beyond those written by ?lfric are the prose life of Saint Guthlac (Vercelli Book), the life of Saint Margaret and the life of Saint Chad. There are four additional lives in the earliest manuscript of the Lives of Saints, the Julius manuscript: Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, Saint Mary of Egypt, Saint Eustace and Saint Euphrosyne.[61]\\r\\nThere are six major manuscripts of the Wessex Gospels, dating from the 11th and 12th centuries. The most popular, Old English Gospel of Nicodemus, is treated in one manuscript as though it were a 5th gospel; other apocryphal gospels in translation include the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, Vindicta salvatoris, Vision of Saint Paul and the Apocalypse of Thomas.[61]\\r\\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was probably started in the time of King Alfred the Great and continued for over 300?years as a historical record of Anglo-Saxon history.[58]\\r\\nA single example of a Classical romance has survived: a fragment of the story of Apollonius of Tyre was translated in the 11th century from the Gesta Romanorum.[61][63]\\r\\nA monk who was writing in Old English at the same time as ?lfric and Wulfstan was Byrhtferth of Ramsey, whose book Handboc was a study of mathematics and rhetoric. He also produced a work entitled Computus, which outlined the practical application of arithmetic to the calculation of calendar days and movable feasts, as well as tide tables.[58]\\r\\n?lfric wrote two proto-scientific works, Hexameron and Interrogationes Sigewulfi, dealing with the stories of Creation. He also wrote a grammar and glossary in Old English called Latin, later used by students interested in learning Old French because it had been glossed in Old French.[61]\\r\\nIn the Nowell Codex is the text of The Wonders of the East which includes a remarkable map of the world, and other illustrations. Also contained in Nowell is Alexander's Letter to Aristotle. Because this is the same manuscript that contains Beowulf, some scholars speculate it may have been a collection of materials on exotic places and creatures.[64]\\r\\nThere are a number of interesting medical works. There is a translation of Apuleius's Herbarium with striking illustrations, found together with Medicina de Quadrupedibus. A second collection of texts is Bald's Leechbook, a 10th-century book containing herbal and even some surgical cures. A third collection, known as the Lacnunga, includes many charms and incantations.[8]\\r\\nAnglo-Saxon legal texts are a large and important part of the overall corpus. By the 12th century they had been arranged into two large collections (see Textus Roffensis). They include laws of the kings, beginning with those of Aethelbert of Kent and ending with those of Cnut, and texts dealing with specific cases and places in the country. An interesting example is Gerefa which outlines the duties of a reeve on a large manor estate. There is also a large volume of legal documents related to religious houses. These include many kinds of texts: records of donations by nobles; wills; documents of emancipation; lists of books and relics; court cases; guild rules. All of these texts provide valuable insights into the social history of Anglo-Saxon times, but are also of literary value. For example, some of the court case narratives are interesting for their use of rhetoric.[8]\\r\\nOld English literature did not disappear in 1066 with the Norman Conquest. Many sermons and works continued to be read and used in part or whole up through the 14th century, and were further catalogued and organised. During the Reformation, when monastic libraries were dispersed, the manuscripts were collected by antiquarians and scholars. These included Laurence Nowell, Matthew Parker, Robert Bruce Cotton and Humfrey Wanley. In the 17th century there began a tradition of Old English literature dictionaries and references. The first was William Somner's Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum (1659). Lexicographer Joseph Bosworth began a dictionary in the 19th century which was completed by Thomas Northcote Toller in 1898 called An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, which was updated by Alistair Campbell in 1972.[65]\\r\\nBecause Old English was one of the first vernacular languages to be written down, nineteenth-century scholars searching for the roots of European \\"national culture\\" (see Romantic Nationalism) took special interest in studying Anglo-Saxon literature, and Old English became a regular part of university curriculum. Since WWII there has been increasing interest in the manuscripts themselvesNeil Ker, a paleographer, published the groundbreaking Catalogue of Manuscripts Containing Anglo-Saxon in 1957, and by 1980 nearly all Anglo-Saxon manuscript texts were in print. J.R.R. Tolkien is credited with creating a movement to look at Old English as a subject of literary theory in his seminal lecture Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics (1936).[66]\\r\\nOld English literature has had some influence on modern literature, and notable poets have translated and incorporated Old English poetry. Well-known early translations include Alfred, Lord Tennyson's translation of The Battle of Brunanburh William Morris's translation of Beowulf and Ezra Pound's translation of The Seafarer. The influence of the poetry can be seen in modern poets T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and W. H. Auden. Tolkien adapted the subject matter and terminology of heroic poetry for works like The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and John Gardner wrote Grendel, which tells the story of Beowulf's opponent from his own perspective.[66]\\r\\nMore recently other notable poets such as Paul Muldoon, Seamus Heaney, Denise Levertov and U. A. Fanthorpe have all shown an interest in Old English poetry. In 1987 Denise Levertov published a translation of C?dmon's Hymn under her title \\"Caedmon\\" in the collection Breathing the Water. This was then followed by Seamus Heaney's version of the poem \\"Whitby-sur-Moyola\\" in his The Spirit Level (1996) Paul Muldoon's \\"Caedmona's Hymn\\" in his Moy Sand and Gravel (2002) and U. A. Fanthorpe's \\"Caedmon's Song\\" in her Queuing for the Sun (2003). These translations differ greatly from one another, just as Seamus Heaney's Beowulf (1999) deviates from earlier, similar projects. Heaney uses Irish diction across Beowulf to bring what he calls a \\"special body and force\\" to the poem, foregrounding his own Ulster heritage, \\"in order to render (the poem) ever more 'willable forward/again and again and again.'\\"","input":"What was the first literature of the anglo-saxons?"},{"output":"half dollar","context":"The half dollar, sometimes referred to as the half for short, is a United States coin worth 50 cents, one-half of a dollar, and is the largest United States circulating coin currently produced[1] in both size and weight, being 1.205 inches (30.61?mm) in diameter and .085 inches (2.15?mm) in thickness, and is twice the weight of the quarter. The current half dollar, the Kennedy half dollar, depicts the profile of President John F. Kennedy on the obverse and the Seal of the President of the United States on the reverse, but the design has undergone a number of changes throughout its history.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough not commonly used today, half dollar coins have a long history of heavy use alongside other denominations of coinage, but have faded out of general circulation for many reasons. They were produced in fairly large quantities until the year 2002, when the U.S. Mint ceased production of the coin for general circulation. As a result of its decreasing usage, a large amount of pre-2002 half dollars remain in Federal Reserve vaults, prompting the change in production. Presently, collector half dollars can be ordered directly from the U.S. Mint,[2] and pre-2002 circulation half dollars may be ordered through most U.S. banks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf dollar coins saw heavy use, particularly in the first half of the 20th century. For many years, they were commonly (and in many areas still are) used by the gambling community. Rolls of half dollars may still be kept on hand in cardrooms for games requiring 50-cent antes or bring-in bets, for dealers to pay winning naturals in blackjack, or where the house collects a rake in increments. Additionally, some concession vendors at sporting events distribute half dollar coins as change for convenience.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the early 1960s, the rising price of silver was nearing the point where the bullion value of U.S. silver coins would exceed face value. In 1965, the U.S. introduced layered composition coins made of a copper core laminated between two cupronickel outer faces. The silver content of dimes and quarters was eliminated, but the Kennedy half dollar composition still contained silver (reduced from 90% to 40%) from 1965 to 1970.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf dollars issued through the end of the 1960s were hoarded as the only precious metal U.S. coins remaining in production, and as the price of silver continued to rise, pre-1964 halves disappeared from circulation as well. By the time that the coin's composition was changed to match that of the clad dimes and quarters in 1971, both businesses and the public had begun to adapt to a country in which the half dollar did not generally circulate. The half saw a moderate increase in usage during the mid 1970s, only to fall again by the end of the decade. The quarter then took over the half's role as the highest-value component of change in general use.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost coins enter circulation through the change drawers of businesses. Few businesses stock their change drawers with half dollars, and some banks do not stock them at all. Most banks do not hand them out as normal business practice, so the coins see little circulation.  Most U.S. vending machines do not accept half dollars, nor do payphones, which further curtails their circulation; Many transit systems however, accept halves and the coin is the most common denomination used for U.S. commemorative coins.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2002, half dollars have been minted only for collectors, due to large Federal Reserve and government inventories on hand of pre-2001 pieces; this is mostly due to lack of demand and large quantity returns from casino slot machines that now operate \\"coinless\\". Eventually, when the reserve supply runs low, the mint will again fill orders for circulation half dollars.[citation needed] It took about 18 years (1981ÿ1999) for the large inventory stockpile of a similar low-demand circulation coin, the $1 coin, to reach reserve levels low enough to again produce circulation pieces.[citation needed] Modern-date half dollars can be purchased in proof sets, mint sets, rolls, and bags from the U.S. Mint, and existing inventory circulation pieces can be ordered through most U.S. banks. All collector issues since 2001 have had much lower mintages than in previous years. Although intended only for collectors, these post-2001 half dollars sometimes find their way into circulation.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 1, 1794, the first half dollars, approximately 5,300 pieces, were delivered. Another 18,000 were produced in January 1795 using dies of 1794, to save the expense of making new ones.[5] Another 30,000 pieces were struck by the end of 1801. The coin had the Heraldic Eagle, based on the Great Seal of the United States on the reverse.[5]  150,000 were minted in 1804 but struck with dies from 1803, so no 1804 specimens exist, though there were some pieces dated 1805 that carried a \\"5 over 4\\" overdate.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1838, half dollar dies were produced in the Philadelphia Mint for the newly established New Orleans Mint, and ten test samples of the 1838 half dollars were made at the main Philadelphia mint. These samples were put into the mint safe along with other rarities like the 1804 silver dollar. The dies were then shipped to New Orleans for the regular production of 1838 half dollars. However, New Orleans production of the half dollars was delayed due to the priority of producing half dimes and dimes. The large press for half dollar production was not used in New Orleans until January 1839 to produce 1838 half dollars, but the reverse die could not be properly secured, and only ten samples were produced before the dies failed. Rufus Tyler, chief coiner of the New Orleans mint, wrote to Mint Director Patterson of the problem on February 25, 1839.[6] The Orleans mint samples all had a double stamped reverse as a result of this production problem and they also showed dramatic signs of die rust, neither of which are present on the Philadelphia produced test samples. While eight Philadelphia minted samples survive to this day, there is only one known New Orleans minted specimen with the tell-tale double stamped reverse and die rust. This is the famous coin that Rufus Tyler presented to Alexander Dallas Bache (great grandson of Benjamin Franklin) in the summer of 1839 and was later purchased in June 1894 by A. G. Heaton, the father of mint mark coin collecting.[7] The 1838 Philadelphia-produced half dollars are extremely rare, with two separate specimens having sold for $632,500 in Heritage auctions in 2005 and 2008[8] respectively.  The sole surviving Orleans minted 1838 is one of the rarest of all American coins.[9][10] In 1840 this mint produced nearly 180,000 half dollars.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1861, the New Orleans mint produced coins for three different governments. A total of 330,000 were struck under the United States government, 1,240,000 for the State of Louisiana after it seceded from the Union, and 962,633 after it joined the Confederacy. Since the same die was used for all strikings, the output looks identical. However the Confederate States of America actually minted four half dollars with a CSA (rather than USA) reverse and the obverse die they used had a small die crack. Thus \\"regular\\" 1861 half dollars with this crack probably were used by the Confederates for some of the mass striking.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two varieties of Kennedy half dollars in the proof set issues of 1964. Initially, the die was used with accented hair, showing deeper lines than the president's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, liked. New dies were prepared to smooth out some of the details. It is estimated that about 1 to 3% (40,000 to 100,000) of the proof halves are of the earlier type, making them somewhat more expensive for collectors.[12]","input":"What do you call a 50 cent coin?"},{"output":"\\"advocacy of the use of force\\"","context":"Exceptions to free speech in the United States are limitations on the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and expression as recognized by the United States Supreme Court. These exceptions have been created over time, based on certain types of speech and expression, and under different contexts. While freedom of speech in the United States is a right protected by the constitution, these exceptions make that right a limited one.\\r\\nRestrictions that are based on people's reactions to words include both instances of a complete exception, and cases of diminished protection. Commercial advertising receives diminished, but not eliminated, protection.\\r\\nAlong with communicative restrictions, less protection is afforded for uninhibited speech when the government acts as subsidizer or speaker, is an employer, controls education, or regulates the mail, airwaves, legal bar, military, prisons, and immigration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court has held that \\"advocacy of the use of force\\" is unprotected when it is \\"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action\\" and is \\"likely to incite or produce such action\\".[1][2] In Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan group for \\"advocating?... violence?... as a means of accomplishing political reform\\" because their statements at a rally did not express an immediate, or imminent intent to do violence.[3] This rule amended a previous decision of the Court, in Schenck v. United States (1919), which simply decided that a \\"clear and present danger\\" could justify a congressional rule limiting speech. The primary distinction is that the latter test does not criminalize \\"mere advocacy\\".[4]\\r\\nIn 2017, a juvenile court in Massachusetts ruled that repeatedly encouraging someone to commit suicide was excluded from First Amendment protection,[5] and found a 20-year-old woman, who was 17 at the time, guilty of manslaughter on this basis.[6] The judge cited a little-known 1816 precedent.[7] The woman is expected to file an appeal.[6]\\r\\nIn Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974), the Supreme Court decided that there is \\"no constitutional value in false statements of fact\\".[8] However, this is not a concrete rule as the Court has struggled with how much of the \\"speech that matters\\" can be put at risk in order to punish a falsehood.[9]\\r\\nThe Supreme Court has established a complex framework in determining which types of false statements are unprotected.[10] There are four such areas which the Court has been explicit about. First, false statements of fact that are said with a \\"sufficiently culpable mental state\\" can be subject to civil or criminal liability.[11] Secondly, knowingly making a false statement of fact can almost always be punished. For example, libel and slander law are permitted under this category. Third, negligently false statements of fact may lead to civil liability in some instances.[12] Additionally, some implicit statements of factthose that may just have a \\"false factual connotation\\"still could fall under this exception.[13][14]\\r\\nThere is also a fifth category of analysis. It is possible that some completely false statements could be entirely free from punishment. The Supreme Court held in the landmark case New York Times v. Sullivan (1964) that lies about the government may be protected completely.[15] However, this category is not entirely clear, as the question of whether false historical or medical claims are protected is still disputed.[16]\\r\\nUnder the Miller test (which takes its name from Miller v. California), speech is unprotected if (1) \\"the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the [subject or work in question], taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\\" and (2) \\"depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, contemporary community standards,[17] sexual conduct defined by the applicable state law\\" and (3) \\"the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\\".[18] Some subsidiary components of this rule may permit private possession of obscene materials at one's home.[19] Additionally, the phrase \\"appeals to the prurient interest\\" is limited to appeals to a \\"shameful or morbid interest in sex\\".[20][21]\\r\\nThe Court has also held that a person may only be punished if he knows the actual \\"contents of the material\\".[22] In Smith v. California (1959), the Supreme Court thus gave a defense of \\"reasonable ignorance\\" to an obscenity charge. The basis for this exception is that justices have believed that obscenity has a \\"tendency to exert a corrupting and debasing impact leading to antisocial behavior\\".[23][24]\\r\\nThe exception for child pornography is distinct from the obscenity exception in a few ways. Firstly, the rule is much more specific to what falls under the exception. Secondly, it is irrelevant whether any part of the speech meets the Miller test; if it is classified under the child pornography exception at all, it becomes unprotected.[25] The rule provides that speech is unprotected if it (1) \\"visually depicts\\" children below the age of majority (2) \\"performing sexual acts or lewdly exhibiting their genitals\\".[26] Unlike the rules for simple obscenity, private possession of child pornography \\"may be outlawed\\".[27]\\r\\nWhile this exception is very concrete, it is also limited. It does not apply to pornography that people think is harmful when shown to children,[28] or pornography that urges viewers to harm children.[29]\\r\\nIn Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942), the Supreme Court held that speech is unprotected if it constitutes \\"fighting words\\".[30] Fighting words, as defined by the Court, is speech that \\"tend[s] to incite an immediate breach of the peace\\" by provoking a fight, so long as it is a \\"personally abusive [word] which, when addressed to the ordinary citizen, is, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke a violent reaction\\".[31] Additionally, such speech must be \\"directed to the person of the hearer\\" and is \\"thus likely to be seen as a 'direct personal insult'\\".[32][33]\\r\\nOne legal commentator has suggested that, along with fighting words, speech might be unprotected if the speaker intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly inflicts severe emotional distress.[34] However, the United States Supreme Court has not implemented such an exception, and even if it does, the exception would probably be limited to private figures. The Court held in Hustler v. Falwell (1988) that satire which could be seen as offensive to a \\"public figure\\" is fully protected.[35] Such speech is rooted in a historical protection of political satire.[36] A notable example of a case involving offensive speech was the Court's decision in Texas v. Johnson (1989), which struck down a law criminalizing flag burning in Texas.[37]\\r\\nTrue threats of violence that are directed at a person or group of persons that have the intent of placing the target at risk of bodily harm or death are generally unprotected.[38] However, there are several exceptions. For example, the Supreme Court has held that \\"threats may not be punished if a reasonable person would understand them as obvious hyperbole\\", he writes.[39][40] Additionally, threats of \\"social ostracism\\" and of \\"politically motivated boycotts\\" are constitutionally protected.[41]\\r\\nAnother class of permissible restrictions on speech is based on intellectual property rights.[42] Things like copyrights or trademarks fall under this exception. The Supreme Court first held this in Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises (1985), where copyright law was upheld against a First Amendment free speech challenge.[43] Also, broadcasting rights for shows are not an infringement of free speech rights.[44] The Court has upheld such restrictions as an incentive for artists in the 'speech marketplace'.[45]\\r\\nCommercial speech occupies a unique role as a free speech exception. While there is no complete exception, legal advocates recognize it as having \\"diminished protection\\".[46] For example, false advertising can be punished and misleading advertising may be prohibited.[47] Commercial advertising may be restricted in ways that other speech can't if a substantial governmental interest is advanced, and that restriction supports that interest as well as not being overly broad.[48] This doctrine of limited protection for advertisements is due to a balancing inherent in the policy explanations for the rule, namely that other types of speech (for example, political) are much more important.[49]\\r\\nThe government is not permitted to fire an employee based on the employee's speech if either the speech is on a matter of public concern, the speech is not said as part of that employee's job duties,[50] or the damage caused by the speech is outweighed by the value of the speech to the employee and public.[51][52] Specifically, speech is \\"treated as a matter of public concern\\" by reference to the \\"content, form, and context of a given statement\\".[53] The exception with regards to balancing the harm of a statement and the value of the statement (the Pickering test) is done by considering the degree to which the speech either interferes with close working relationships, disrupts the office, or even has the potential to do either.[54]\\r\\nRegulation of speech on broadcast radio and television are permissible when they are (1) narrowly tailored and (2) further a substantial government interest.[55] Interests that have been found \\"substantial\\" include shielding listeners from supposedly offensive ideas and shielding children from offensive expression. The Supreme Court has limited these rules to traditional broadcasting, refusing an attempt to apply this to the internet.[56]\\r\\nWhen the Government acts as a kindergarten through twelfth grade educator, they are allowed to restrict speech in certain instances. The Supreme Court ruled in Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist. (1969) that only when speech \\"materially and substantially interferes with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school\\".[57] Later court decisions added more situations where restrictions were possible, including student speech about drugs,[58] \\"vulgar and offensive\\" language,[59] and school-operated newspapers.[60] The primary basis for the educator-distinction is based on the concept of in loco parentis, the principle that the school functions as parents over the students, thus allowing broader discretion in limiting student speech and expression.[61]\\r\\nThe most complex special capacity of the government is when it functions, in one way or another, as the Subsidizer of the speech in question.[62] As a general rule, the government can itself say whatever it wants to, even if this \\"favors one viewpoint over another\\".[63] But, the government may not impose conditions on how subsidy recipients spend money they get from other sources.[64] If the government is using the speakers to express its own message, it is constitutional.[65] But this analysis changes if the government is trying to encourage a \\"diversity of private views indiscriminately\\". If it is indiscriminate, then under Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez (2001), the government must be acting in a viewpoint-neutral way. However, if the government is basing some judgment of \\"quality\\" on the views, then only \\"invidious viewpoint discrimination\\" is barred.[66]\\r\\nThe basic principle behind government's regulation of the bar has greater power to regulate the speech of lawyers.[67] A balancing test is employed when the Court considers attorney speech. This test weighs the \\"interest against the State's legitimate interest in regulating the activity in question [with] the interests of the attorney\\".[68] Thus, while commercial advertising by lawyers is generally protected, rules of professional conduct and ethical guidelines are still permitted.[69]\\r\\nWith respect to the United States Military, the federal government has extremely broad power to restrict the speech of military officers, even if such a restriction would be invalid with a civilian. The Supreme Court affirmed this principle in Parker v. Levy (1974) when the Court held the military was essentially a \\"specialized society from civilian society\\", which necessitated stricter guidelines.[70] Since Parker, there have been few cases to issue more specific limits on the government's control of military expression.\\r\\nWhen the government acts as controller of prisons, it has broad abilities to limit the free speech of inmates. Essentially any restriction that is \\"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests\\" is valid.[71] This broad power also extends to pretrial detainees and even convicts who are on probation or parole.[72] The only limit recognized by the Court is that the prison must provide an \\"alternate means of exercising that right\\" of speech, an alternate channel, that still allows legitimate speech to be expressed.\\r\\nThe government may not criminally punish immigrants based on speech that would be protected if said by a citizen.[73] On entry across borders, the government may bar non-citizens from the United States based on their speech, even if that speech would have been protected if said by a citizen.[74] Speech rules as to deportation, on the other hand, are unclear.[75] Lower courts are divided on the question, while the leading cases on the subject are from the Red Scare.","input":"What is not a protected form of speech?"},{"output":"conflict between the Brotherhood of Assassins, who fight for peace by promoting liberty, and The Order of the Ancientsforerunners to the Templar Orderwho desire peace through the forced imposition of order","context":"Assassin's Creed Origins is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the tenth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series and the successor to 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate. It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on October 27, 2017.\\r\\nThe game is set in Egypt during the near end of the Ptolemaic period (49-47 BC) and recounts the secret fictional history of real-world events. The story explores the origins of the centuries-long conflict between the Brotherhood of Assassins, who fight for peace by promoting liberty, and The Order of the Ancientsforerunners to the Templar Orderwho desire peace through the forced imposition of order.\\r\\nOrigins received positive reviews from critics, who praised the story, characters, voice acting, reworked gameplay-systems, immersive world of Egypt and the visuals, while criticizing some of the pacing and technical issues. The game has been lauded as either the best or one of the best installments in the series by multiple critics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAssassin's Creed Origins is an action-adventure stealth game played from a third-person perspective. Players complete questslinear scenarios with set objectivesto progress through the story, earn experience points, and acquire new skills. Outside of quests, the player can freely roam the open world environment on foot, horseback, camel-back or boat to explore locations, complete optional side-quests and unlock weapons and equipment.\\r\\nThe \\"eagle vision\\" mode, which was used by the franchise to give the player the ability to scout an area by highlighting enemies and objects, has been replaced by a Bonelli's eagle named Senu as a companion.[1] The player is able to take control of Senu and scout an area in advance, highlighting enemies which will then be visible when they return to controlling Bayek, the game's main character. The player can also tame various predators which will serve as a companion for the player and assist them against enemies.[2] Naval combat, underwater exploration and tomb raiding return to the series.[2][3][4][5][6]\\r\\nThe game also features revised combat mechanics.[7] Previous titles in the Assassin's Creed series used a \\"paired animation system\\" whereby the player character would engage with an enemy and combat would be dictated by a series of predeterminted animations based on player inputs and scripted AI movements. Origins moves to a \\"hit-box system\\". When the player wields a weapon, they will strike at whatever is in range, allowing them to hit enemies directly, injure individual body parts, and creating the possibility of missing an enemy entirely. Complementing this is the way weapons fall into different categories and are rated on their damage dealt, speed and range.[8] Enemies will be drawn from several basic archetypes that use a variety of tactics in combat which, combined with the hit-box system, will require the player to learn the attributes of individual weapons and tailor their playing style to succeed in combat. As enemy combat is also dictated by the hit-box system, the player has been equipped with a shield and will need to balance their offensive and defensive capabilities.[7] Locations within the game world are designed to enable the player to choose their playing style by offering stealth and open combat as equally-viable choices for completing objectives.\\r\\nOrigins introduces an arena-based combat system where the player fights waves of increasingly difficult combinations of enemies culminating in a boss fight.[9] While the introduction to the arena is incorporated into the main story, the arena mode stands alone from the wider narrative. The game world features several arenas, with a variety of enemy combinations and unique bosses not found in the game world. The player is able to unlock additional weapons and equipment by completing arena fights.\\r\\nA future update to the game will add \\"Discovery Tour\\", a sandbox mode allowing the player to freely explore the open world with no objectives or combat, and embark on guided tours that highlight aspects of Egyptian history.[10][11]\\r\\nThe player takes on the role of a Medjay named Bayek and his wife Aya, as they work to protect the people of the Ptolemaic Kingdom during a time of widespread upheaval: the Pharaoh, Ptolemy XIII, struggles to maintain his rule while harbouring ambitions of expanding his kingdom; his sister, the recently deposed Cleopatra, begins marshalling loyalist forces to launch a counter-coup against Ptolemy; and frequent incursions into the Kingdom by the Roman Republic under the command of Julius Caesar lead to fears of an imminent invasion. Bayek's role as a Medjay brings him and Aya into contact with the secretive forces manipulating these events and into becoming the first Assassins.\\r\\nIn the present day, Layla Hassan, a researcher at Abstergo's Historical Research Division, is tasked along with her friend and co-worker Deanna Geary with finding and retrieving an artifact in Egypt. However, she instead finds a tomb containing the mummies of ancient Assassins Bayek and Aya. Hoping to find any relevant information that would secure her a position in the company's Animus Project, Layla decides to relive both Bayek and Aya's memories using her modified Animus without telling her superiors, despite Deanna's protest.\\r\\nIn 49 BCE, Bayek, a respected Medjay in charge of protecting the Siwa Oasis, is abducted along with his son Khemu by a group of five masked men to an underground vault in the Temple of Amun. The masked men give Bayek a golden orb and demand that he use it to open a secret Vault. Khemu helps Bayek escape, but during the struggle to kill one of the masked men, Bayek inadvertently stabs Khemu in the chest, killing him.\\r\\nOne year later in 48 BCE, Bayek had exiled himself from Siwa in order to track down the five masked men to take his revenge. He finds the first one, Rudjek \\"The Heron\\", and kills him. Bayek then returns to Siwa to kill the local priest Medunamun, \\"The Ibis\\", who has been torturing Siwans for information to open the same vault. After killing Medunamun, Bayek then heads for Alexandria, where Aya has been tracking another of the masked men. Upon meeting Aya, she reveals that she has already killed Actaeon \\"The Vulture\\" and Ktesos \\"The Ram\\", leaving only one target left, \\"The Snake\\". Aya also reveals that she has been working with Apollodorus the Sicilian and Cleopatra to uncover The Snake's identity. She gives Bayek the first Hidden Blade, which he uses to track down and kill Eudoros, whom he believes to be the \\"Snake\\" in a bathhouse. Killing Eudoros costs Bayek his left ring finger, cut off from the same hidden blade to kill his target.\\r\\nBayek remembers Eudoros' words and begins to have doubts. He decides to meet with Apollodorus and Cleopatra for answers. Cleopatra tells Bayek that she was ousted from the throne by the masked men, who call themselves the Order of Ancients and seek to control all of Egypt by using Ptolemy as their puppet. In addition, there are more members of Order than the five Bayek and Aya had already killed: \\"The Scarab\\", \\"The Hyena\\", \\"The Lizard\\" and \\"The Crocodile\\". In fact, Eudoros was actually \\"The Hippo\\", and the name of the Snake is used to refer to the Order as a whole. Confronted with this new information, Bayek agrees to become Cleopatra's Medjay and assassinate the remaining members of the Order. Bayek tracks down and kills all of them while Aya convinces Pompey the Great to ally with Cleopatra.\\r\\nIn the present, Layla and Deanna are attacked by Abstergo soldiers for failing to check in with the company. Layla kills her attackers, but Deanna is captured and executed. Swearing revenge, Layla returns to the Animus, determined to complete her mission.\\r\\nBayek receives a letter from Aya explaining that there are two more members of the Order, \\"The Scorpion\\" and \\"The Jackal\\", who are members of Ptolemy's royal guard and the likely culprits responsible for Khemu's death. He finds out that Lucius Septimius is the Jackal and tracks him, but is too late to stop him from assassinating Pompey. With no other options, Cleopatra has Bayek and Aya help sneak her into the palace to meet Julius Caesar. Cleopatra impresses Caesar and secures his support. Bayek kills Pothinus, \\"The Scorpion\\", but is stopped from killing Septimius by Caesar. Aya watches Ptolemy get eaten by crocodiles when he tries to flee across the Nile.\\r\\nAfter the end of the civil war, Cleopatra takes the throne as Pharaoh. Septimius becomes an advisor for Caesar and Cleopatra cuts ties with Bayek and Aya. This causes Bayek and his supporters to realize that Cleopatra and Caesar have now allied themselves with the Order. Realizing his mistake in supporting Cleopatra, Bayek gathers his allies to form a brotherhood to counter the Order and defend the free will of the common people. Bayek and Aya realize the Order showed a strong interest in the tomb of Alexander the Great, which they investigate. There, they find a mortally wounded Apollodorus who warns them that Caesar's lieutenant, Flavius, is \\"The Lion\\" and the true leader of the Order. He and Septimius had taken the Orb and a Staff from the tomb and are heading back to Siwa for the Vault.\\r\\nUpon returning to Siwa, they find the Vault already opened. Bayek tracks down and confronts Flavius, who bears the activated Apple of Eden, but kills him, avenging Khemu's death. Bayek returns to Aya, who has recruited Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger and Gaius Cassius Longinus to their cause. She plans to head to Rome with Brutus and Cassius to assassinate Caesar and Septimius. Bayek and Aya part ways but form the foundation of the Assassin Brotherhood when they both swear to protect the world from the shadows. Upon their separation, Bayek drops his eagle's skull charm, a necklace of Khemu's, into the sand which leaves an impression, becoming the icon of their new Brotherhood.\\r\\nAfter this, Layla wakes up from the Animus to find William Miles, present day Mentor of the Assassin Brotherhood watching over her. She accepts William's offer to work with the Assassins, but stops short of actually joining them. The two depart for Alexandria.\\r\\nIn Rome, Aya confronts Septimius, who wields the Staff of Eden, and she kills him. She then infiltrates the Roman Senate and assassinates Caesar. Later, she meets with Cleopatra and warns her to be a fair ruler or she will return to assassinate her. Afterward, Bayek and Aya (now calling herself Amunet)[b] begin recruiting and training other Assassins as they build the Assassin Brotherhood in Egypt and Rome respectively.\\r\\nDevelopment of Assassin's Creed Origins started in early 2014, after the completion of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.[13] The series had been following a yearly release cycle, but after the launch of Assassin's Creed Syndicate in 2015, Ubisoft chose to delay the release of Origins until 2017.[14] Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot cited a desire to focus on the quality of the individual titles, the opportunity to develop future games with new engines, and the disappointing sales of Syndicate as the reasons behind the decision.[15] The team enlisted Ubisoft Kiev to develop the PC version in parallel with the console versions.[16]\\r\\nInformation on Origins, then titled Assassin's Creed Empire, first leaked in January 2017, showing several screenshots of a character on a boat and in front of a cave. The game was officially revealed on June 11, 2017.[6] It is being developed using the latest iteration of the AnvilNext engine.[citation needed] During production of Assassin's Creed III in November 2011 Ubisoft conducted a fan survey exploring potential settings for future titles. Ancient Egypt was one of the most popular choices,[17] but Alex Hutchinson, the creative director of Assassin's Creed III, dismissed the results as he considered Ancient Egyptas with the other two chosen settings, feudal Japan and World War IIas being \\"the worst choices\\" for a setting.[18] The development team hired Egyptologists to assist in making the open world more accurate to the time period.[19]\\r\\nThe original score for the game was composed by Sarah Schachner, who previously worked on the series with Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin's Creed Unity.[20]\\r\\nIn August 2017, Square Enix announced a promotional crossover between the Assassin's Creed franchise and Final Fantasy XV.[21] Taking the form of an in-game event, it introduced Assassin's Creed-themed content to the game.[22] Assassin's Creed-themed content was also made available in other Ubisoft games such as Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands and South Park: The Fractured but Whole.\\r\\nAssassin's Creed Origins received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[23][24][25]\\r\\nGameSpot gave the game a 7/10, saying: \\"While Assassin's Creed Origins reaches great heights in this new setting, it routinely runs into issues that bog down the overall experience. Technical issues make for an inconsistent experience and its new gameplay pillars wobble under the weight of its systems. But despite this, the world of Origins remains fresh and exciting to explore, which is a testament to the remarkable setting and compelling story.\\"[30]\\r\\nLouise Blain from GamesRadar gave the game a score of 5 out of 5 stars and called it the best of the franchise, saying that \\"As beautiful as it is deadly, Origins' Egyptian playground is finally everything you wanted the Creed to be.\\"[31] Ray Carsillo's score of 9/10 on EGMNow said that \\"Assassin's Creed Origins delivers a robust experience that mixes up the traditional Assassin's Creed formula in a way that's fresh and fun to playbut which also harkens back to the series' roots in some welcome ways, too. It marks an evolution fans might not have even known they were waiting for, delivering one of the best overall experiences we've seen yet from the series.\\"[27]\\r\\nAlanah Pearce's 9/10 review on IGN stated that \\"Assassin's Creed Origins is a deep-dive into a truly stunning realization of ancient Egypt, with a rich series of cultures, genuine characters, and more mission variety than any other game in the series. The combat is challenging and thoughtful, and while the loot system doesn't match up to games like Destiny 2, there are enough different weapon types and enough enemy variety to keep you swapping between weapons, catered to the situation. The RPG elements encourage challenges of their own, and even despite a handful of bugs, I desperately wanted to keep playing.\\"[32]\\r\\nColin Campbell of Polygon gave the game a score of 8.5/10, writing, \\"In essence, Assassin's Creed Origins is much the same game as the original Assassin's Creed, which came out a decade ago. It's a formula that people like to play, and it's certainly been honed and improved over the years. Origins is, then, undoubtedly the best iteration of this formula yet. But I yearn for a fresh approach and new ideas, something that astounds the senses as much as the wondrous world this game inhabits.\\"[34]\\r\\nEurogamer ranked the game 23rd on their list of the \\"Top 50 Games of 2017\\",[36] while EGMNow ranked it sixth on their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017.[37]\\r\\nA controversy arose when several online video game journalists discovered that many of the game's user reviews on review aggregator Metacritic were artificially improved through the use of an online bot.[38]","input":"What is the plot of assassins creed origins?"},{"output":"historical neighborhood","context":"The Gaslamp Quarter is a district of San Diego, California.

Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres is located one block away in downtown San Diego's East Village.\\r\\nThe area is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places as Gaslamp Quarter Historic District. Its main period of development began in 1867, when Alonzo Horton bought the land in hopes of creating a new city center closer to the bay, and chose 5th Avenue as its main street. After a period of urban decay, the neighborhood underwent urban renewal in the 1980s and 1990s.\\r\\nThe Gaslamp Quarter extends from Broadway to Harbor Drive, and from 4th to 6th Avenue, covering 16? blocks.

It spans the Yarra River, just north of its mouth into Port Phillip, and is a vital link between the inner city (CBD) and Melbourne's western suburbs; with the industrial suburbs in the west and with the city of Geelong, 80 kilometres (50?mi) to the south-west. It is one of the busiest road corridors in Australia.\\r\\nThe main river span is 336 metres (1,102?ft) in length, and the height above the water is 58 metres. The total length of the bridge is 2,582.6 metres (8,473.1?ft). It is the third longest in Australia behind the 3.2 kilometre Macleay River Bridge and the Houghton Highway along with its twin the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge, and is twice as long as the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It is one of the highest bridges in Australia, most notably trailing the more iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge.\\r\\nThe bridge passes over Westgate Park, a large environmental and recreational reserve created during the bridge's construction. The bridge carries up to 200,000 vehicles per day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe West Gate Bridge carries five lanes of motor vehicle traffic in each direction, therefore a 10 lane dual-carriageway freeway bridge.\\r\\nThe freeway corridor (including the bridge itself) carries a very high volume and occupancy of traffic, between 180,000 - 200,000 cars / trucks / motorcycles use it per day, according to VicRoads. This makes the West Gate Bridge and West Gate Freeway one of the busiest road corridors in Australia.\\r\\nHowever, being the only main direct link between Melbourne's CBD and the West, it is frequently congested during the morning and afternoon peaks (despite having 5 lanes in each direction) and is constantly busy 24/7, due to the amount and type of vehicles coming in and out of Melbourne (i.e.) Port of Melbourne.\\r\\nThe bridge was originally tolled. Tolls were abolished in 1985, because drivers were using other routes to avoid the toll.[1]\\r\\nCyclists are prohibited from using the bridge except for special bicycle events, notably the MS Summer cycle, which is a fundraising event for multiple sclerosis, and the Around the bay in a day Bicycle Network [2] event that raises money for The Smith Family charity. The Westgate Punt is a foot ferry that runs directly below the bridge, taking cyclists and pedestrians across the Yarra between a jetty at Fishermans Bend near Westgate Park ÿ Bay Trail and a jetty adjacent to Scienceworks Museum ÿ Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail. It operates on demand, from Monday to Friday in morning and evening peaks, and on weekends and public holidays from 10:00?am to 5:00?pm\\r\\nland scape\\r\\nTwo years into construction of the bridge, at 11.50?am on 15 October 1970, the 112?m (367.5?ft) span between piers 10 and 11 collapsed and fell 50?m (164?ft) to the ground and water below. Thirty-five construction workers were killed and 18 injured, making it Australia's worst industrial accident.[3] Many of those who perished were on lunch break beneath the structure in workers' huts, which were crushed by the falling span. Others were working on and inside the girder when it fell. The whole 2,000-tonne (4,400,000?lb) mass plummeted into the Yarra River mud with an explosion of gas, dust and mangled metal that shook buildings hundreds of metres away. Nearby houses were spattered with flying mud. The roar of the impact, the explosion, and the fire that followed, could be clearly heard over 20 kilometres (12?mi) away. On the following morning, 16 October, Sir Henry Bolte (Premier of Victoria) announced that a Royal Commission would be set up immediately to look into the cause of the disaster. The Prime Minister, John Gorton, said: \\"I am sure the whole of Australia is shocked and saddened by the serious accident at West Gate Bridge. Please extend my deepest sympathy to all those families to whom this tragic event has brought such grief.\\"[4]\\r\\nA Royal Commission into the collapse was established, which concluded on 14 July 1971. It attributed the failure of the bridge to two causes: the structural design by designers Freeman Fox & Partners and an unusual method of construction by World Services and Construction, the original contractors of the project.\\r\\nOn the day of the collapse, there was a difference in camber of 11.4?centimetres (4.5?in) between two half-girders at the west end of the span which needed to be joined. It was proposed that the higher one be weighted down with 10 concrete blocks, each weighing 8?t (8.8 short tons), which were located on site. The weight of these blocks caused the span to buckle, which was a sign of structural failure. The longitudinal joining of the half girders was partially complete when orders came through to remove the buckle. As the bolts were removed, the bridge snapped back and the span collapsed.\\r\\nSix twisted fragments of the collapsed bridge can be found adorning the gardens in the engineering faculty of Monash University, Clayton campus. It is said by students that they are to remind engineers of the consequences of their errors. Monash University acquired these when asked to participate in the investigation of the collapse.[5]\\r\\nCommemorations have been held on 15 October every year since the collapse.[6] A West Gate Bridge Memorial Park to workers who lost their lives is located near the bridge. It opened on the 34th anniversary of the collapse, 15 October 2004. It includes the existing West Gate Bridge Memorial and Sculpture, and the memorial for six who died in the Spotswood Yarra Sewer Tunnel collapse of 12 April 1895 (Good Friday).[7][8]\\r\\nConstruction resumed in 1972, with the bridge being completed in 1978. After 10 years of construction, the bridge, a part of the larger West Gate Freeway, cost $202 million.[1]\\r\\nSpeed cameras were erected on the bridge in 2004, but were not activated until September 2005, because of issues with a similar camera on the Western Ring Road.[9] However these speed cameras were switched off in 2005, and currently remain disabled, as the sway of the bridge prevents secondary verification of the alleged speed against a fixed point.[10] In 2006 the State Government spent $1.3 million on erecting railway style boom barriers at each entrance to the bridge to block traffic in the event of a terrorist attack.[11] In March 2007 the State Government announced that two flagpoles would be erected atop the main bridge pylons, to fly the Australian and Victorian flags, each being 10 metres by 5 metres in size and 135m above sea level.[12] Costing $350,000 to install and $15,000 a year to maintain,[13] the flags were unfurled on 24 September 2008.[14]\\r\\nOn 5 August 2007 it was reported that the Victorian Government was planning a $240 million project to identify and eliminate structural weaknesses in the bridge, with specific concerns including crash barriers, cracking, corrosion and potential buckling. News of the work was prompted by the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. Experts were reported as saying the West Gate was initially designed to carry loads of 25 tonnes but now carried B-double trucks weighing up to 68 tonnes. The bridge was built to carry 40,000 vehicles a day, but volumes are now more than four times the original amount, approximately 160,000 vehicles on an average day.[15]\\r\\nOn 11 March 2014 a 10 metres (33?ft) artist-designed flag was raised on the western side of the bridge as part of the 'Melbourne Now' exhibition, On Top of the World: Flags for Melbourne.[16] The flag was a collaborative design between four contributing artists involved in the show who shared an affinity with the bridge. Its a reference to 1803 maritime communications by Rear Admiral Home Riggs Popham, the symbol on the flag meaning I can spare what you asked for. The flag was flown until the end of the 'Melbourne Now' show on 25 March 2014.[17] Artists Brook Andrew, Helen Johnson, Kate Daw and Jon Campbell were collaborating with Stewart Russell[18] as curator.\\r\\nOn 17 May 2006, the State Government as part of their Meeting Our Transport Challenges plan announced plans to change traffic flow in peak periods on the West Gate Bridge and approaches to it, using a reversible lane to provide five traffic lanes in the peak direction, opposing traffic having three lanes.[19] This was to be done using overhead signals and barriers and the State Government allocated funds to this project in its 2006ÿ2007 state budget,[citation needed] but the works were never carried out.\\r\\nIn 2008 the expansion plans were revised as part of the Victorian Transport Plan, when it was announced that the bridge would be widened to 5 lanes in each direction, the space being gained by narrowing the existing traffic lanes and closing the emergency lanes, in a move criticised by Victorian fire, police and ambulance unions.[20] Overhead gantries would be used to direct traffic out of lanes when breakdowns and accidents occur. Costed at $240 million, each lane would be 3.1 metres wide, by comparison lanes on the Sydney Harbour Bridge have a width of 2.8 metres.[20] Roads Minister Tim Pallas claimed that the plan would allow the bridge to carry 50 percent more vehicles, while reducing crashes by 20 percent.[21] Structural analysis work on the bridge concluded in early 2009 and was completed over a 14-month period. Works to strengthen the bridge commenced in the first half of 2009, with the entire strengthening project scheduled for completion in 2011.[22]\\r\\nOn 22 June 2011 all five lanes were finally opened to the public in both directions, with the completion of the required strengthening works.[23] The full cost was $347 million, $107 million more than VicRoads had originally planned, but included considerable additional scope of works. This cost increase was after the deletion of $20 million architectural lighting originally included in the scope of the works.[23] The engineers for the strengthening project, Flint & Neill and Sinclair Knight Merz, won the 2012 Institution of Structural Engineers Supreme Award for structural engineering for the project.[24]\\r\\nStrong growth in suburbs along the route, and increased freight through the Port of Melbourne, means that the corridor is experiencing traffic congestion during peak periods, is vulnerable to short term interruptions and is rapidly approaching capacity. Proposals to abate congestion by allowing more traffic have included bridge widening, a tunnel underneath the river, or adding a second deck to the bridge. Many such plans have come under fire from community groups such as the Public Transport Users Association and Environment Victoria advocating investment in alternative forms of transport.\\r\\nA private sector report made public in February 2006 suggested building a companion tunnel to the West Gate Bridge under the Yarra River. Made up of three separate bores to carry traffic in either direction and a freight rail line, the portals would have been north of Williamstown Road in Port Melbourne, and between Blackshaws and Melbourne roads in Altona North.[25][26]\\r\\nThe State Government also assessed options for the development of another east-west link in 2008. Sir Rod Eddington, former CEO of British Airways and Chairman of the Victorian Major Events Company, will head the assessment of the future East-West connections and recommend the best way forward for public transport, road and freight travel for the entire Monash-West Gate corridor. By December 2008 the State Government announced it was planning for such a link, anticipated to be a three kilometre road tunnel under Footscray and the Maribyrnong River. Linking Dynon and Footscray Roads in the Port of Melbourne precinct to Geelong Road in West Footscray, now known as the East-West road connection its cost is estimated at more than $2.5 billion.[27]\\r\\nPolice data show up to one suicide happens every three weeks at the West Gate Bridge. A 2004 coroner's report recommended anti-suicide fencing or barriers be erected on the bridge to deter people from taking their lives.[28] In 2008, the bodies of a mother in her late 20s and her 18-month-old baby were found on the river bank below the West Gate Bridge, prompting further calls to erect a suicide barrier.[29]\\r\\nThose who argue for a suicide barrier claim that most of those who jump from the West Gate Bridge do so through impulse and that police officers who try to save those who try to jump are putting their own lives in danger. There are multiple incidents of police officers dangling off the side of the bridge while holding onto would-be jumpers.[30] A 2000 Royal Melbourne Hospital study on people who jumped from the bridge found at least 62 cases between 1991 and 1998. Seven people survived the 58-metre fall. Seventy-four percent of those who jumped from the bridge were male, with an average age of 33. More than 70 percent were suffering from mental illness.[31] Of those who jumped off the West Gate Bridge, 31 percent fell on land. Some of those who landed in water drowned afterwards.[32]\\r\\nIn January 2009 a Melbourne girl, Darcey Freeman, aged 4, was thrown off of the bridge by her father and later died in hospital. In April 2011, Arthur Freeman was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison.[33] Following the incident, a temporary suicide barrier of concrete crash barriers topped with a welded mesh fence was erected starting in February. By June, it had been claimed that the fence had prevented two suicides.[34] A permanent barrier was later installed along the length of the bridge. The barriers are costed at $20 million.[20]","input":"What type of bridge is the west gate bridge?"},{"output":"rodents","context":"","input":"5 animals that belong to the mammal group?"},{"output":"Pyramids","context":"The Old Kingdom, in ancient Egyptian history, is the period in the third millennium?(c. 2686ÿ2181 BC) also known as the 'Age of the?Pyramids' or 'Age of the?Pyramid Builders' as it includes the great 4th Dynasty when King Sneferu perfected the art of pyramid building and the pyramids of Giza?were constructed under the kings Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure.[1] Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilization ÿ the first of three so-called \\"Kingdom\\" periods (followed by the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom) which mark the high points of civilization in the lower Nile Valley.\\r\\nThe term itself was coined by 18th-century historians, and the distinction between the Old Kingdom and the Early Dynastic Period is not one which would have been recognized by Ancient Egyptians. Not only was the last king of the Early Dynastic Period related to the first two kings of the Old Kingdom, but the 'capital', the royal residence, remained at Ineb-Hedg, the Ancient Egyptian name for Memphis. The basic justification for a separation between the two periods is the revolutionary change in architecture accompanied by the effects on Egyptian society and economy of large-scale building projects.[2]\\r\\nThe Old Kingdom is most commonly regarded as the period from the Third Dynasty through to the Sixth Dynasty (2686ÿ2181 BC). The 4thÿ6th Dynasties of?Egypt are scarce, and historians regard the history of the era as literally 'written in stone' and largely architectural in that it is through the monuments and their inscriptions that scholars have been able to construct a history.[1]?Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom as a continuation of the administration centralized at Memphis. While the Old Kingdom was a period of internal security and prosperity, it was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural decline referred to by Egyptologists as the First Intermediate Period.[3] During the Old Kingdom, the king of Egypt (not called the Pharaoh until the New Kingdom) became a living god who ruled absolutely and could demand the services and wealth of his subjects.[4]\\r\\nUnder King Djoser, the first king of the Third Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, the royal capital of Egypt was moved to Memphis, where Djoser established his court. A new era of building was initiated at Saqqara under his reign. King Djoser's architect, Imhotep, is credited with the development of building with stone and with the conception of the new architectural formthe step pyramid.[4] The Old Kingdom is perhaps best known for the large number of pyramids constructed at this time as burial places for Egypt's kings. For this reason, the Old Kingdom is frequently referred to as \\"the Age of the Pyramids\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom was Djoser (sometime between 2691 and 2625 BC) of the third dynasty, who ordered the construction of a pyramid (the Step Pyramid) in Memphis' necropolis, Saqqara. An important person during the reign of Djoser was his vizier, Imhotep.\\r\\nIt was in this era that formerly independent ancient Egyptian states became known as nomes, under the rule of the Pharaoh. The former rulers were forced to assume the role of governors or otherwise work in tax collection. Egyptians in this era worshipped their Pharaoh as a god, believing that he ensured the annual flooding of the Nile that was necessary for their crops. Egyptian views on the nature of time during this period held that the universe worked in cycles, and the Pharaoh on earth worked to ensure the stability of those cycles. They also perceived themselves as a specially selected people.[6]\\r\\nThe Old Kingdom and its royal power reached a zenith under the Fourth Dynasty (2613ÿ2494 BC), which began with Sneferu (2613ÿ2589 BC). After Djoser, Pharaoh Snefru was the next great pyramid builder. Snefru commissioned the building of not one, but three pyramids. The first is called the Meidum pyramid, named for its location in Egypt. Snefru abandoned it after the outside casing fell off of the pyramid. The Meidum pyramid was the first to have an above-ground burial chamber.[7][7] Using more stones than any other Pharaoh, he built the three pyramids: a now collapsed pyramid in Meidum, the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur, and the Red Pyramid, at North Dahshur. However, the full development of the pyramid style of building was reached not at Saqqara, but during the building of 'The Great Pyramids' at Giza.[8]\\r\\nSneferu was succeeded by his son, Khufu (2589ÿ2566 BC), who built the Great Pyramid of Giza. After Khufu's death, his sons Djedefra (2566ÿ2558 BC) and Khafra (2558ÿ2532 BC) may have quarrelled. The latter built the second pyramid and (in traditional thinking) the Sphinx in Giza. Recent reexamination of evidence has led Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev to propose that the Sphinx had been built by Djedefra as a monument to his father Khufu.[9] Alternatively, the Sphinx has been proposed to be the work of Khafra and Khufu himself.\\r\\nThere were military expeditions into Canaan and Nubia, with Egyptian influence reaching up the Nile into what is today the Sudan.[10] The later kings of the Fourth Dynasty were king Menkaure (2532ÿ2504 BC), who built the smallest pyramid in Giza, Shepseskaf (2504ÿ2498 BC) and, perhaps, Djedefptah (2498ÿ2496 BC).\\r\\nThe Fifth Dynasty (2494ÿ2345 BC) began with Userkaf (2494ÿ2487 BC) and was marked by the growing importance of the cult of sun god Ra. Consequently, fewer efforts were devoted to the construction of pyramid complexes than during the 4th dynasty and more to the construction of sun temples in Abusir. Userkaf was succeeded by his son Sahure (2487ÿ2475 BC) who commanded an expedition to Punt. Sahure was in turn succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai (2475ÿ2455 BC) who was Sahure's son. Neferirkare introduced the prenomen in the royal titulary. He was followed by two short-lived kings, his son Neferefre (2455ÿ2453?BC) and Shepseskare, the latter of uncertain parentage.[11] Shepseskare may have been deposed by Neferefre's brother Nyuserre Ini (2445ÿ2421 BC), a long lived pharaoh who built extensively in Abusir and re-started royal activity in Giza.\\r\\nThe last Pharaohs of the dynasty were Menkauhor Kaiu (2421ÿ2414 BC), Djedkare Isesi (2414ÿ2375 BC) and Unas (2375ÿ2345), the earliest ruler to have the pyramid texts inscribed in his pyramid.\\r\\nEgypt's expanding interests in trade goods such as ebony, incense such as myrrh and frankincense, gold, copper and other useful metals inspired the ancient Egyptians to build suitable ships for navigation of the open sea. They traded with Lebanon for cedar and travelled the length of the Red Sea to the Kingdom of Puntpossibly modern day Somaliafor ebony, ivory and aromatic resins. Ship builders of that era did not use pegs (treenails) or metal fasteners, but relied on rope to keep their ships assembled. Planks and the superstructure were tightly tied and bound together.\\r\\nDuring the sixth dynasty (2345ÿ2181 BC) the power of pharaoh gradually weakened in favor of powerful nomarchs (regional governors). These no longer belonged to the royal family and their charge became hereditary, thus creating local dynasties largely independent from the central authority of the Pharaoh. However, Nile flood control was still the subject of very large works, including especially the canal to Lake Moeris around 2300 BC, which was likely also the source of water to the Giza pyramid complex centuries earlier.\\r\\nInternal disorders set in during the incredibly long reign of Pepi II (2278ÿ2184 BC) towards the end of the dynasty. His death, certainly well past that of his intended heirs, might have created succession struggles. The country slipped into civil wars mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.\\r\\nThe final blow was the 22nd century BC drought in the region that resulted in a drastic drop in precipitation. For at least some years between 2200 and 2150 BC, this prevented the normal flooding of the Nile.[12]\\r\\nWhatever its cause, the collapse of the Old Kingdom was followed by decades of famine and strife. An important inscription on the tomb of Ankhtifi, a nomarch during the early First Intermediate Period, describes the pitiful state of the country when famine stalked the land.\\r\\nEgypt's Old Kingdom (Dynasties 3ÿ6, ca. 2649ÿ2150 BC) was one of the most dynamic periods in the development of Egyptian art. During this period, artists learned to express their culture's worldview, creating for the first time images and forms that endured for generations. Architects and masons mastered the techniques necessary to build monumental structures in stone.[13]\\r\\nSculptors created the earliest portraits of individuals and the first lifesize statues in wood, copper, and stone. They perfected the art of carving intricate relief decoration and, through keen observation of the natural world, produced detailed images of animals, plants, and even landscapes, recording the essential elements of their world for eternity in scenes painted and carved on the walls of temples and tombs.[13]\\r\\nThese images and structures had two principal functions: to ensure an ordered existence and to defeat death by preserving life into the next world. To these ends, over a period of time, Egyptian artists adopted a limited repertoire of standard types and established a formal artistic canon that would define Egyptian art for more than 3,000 years, while remaining flexible enough to allow for subtle variation and innovation. Although much of their artistic effort was centered on preserving life after death, Egyptians also surrounded themselves with objects to enhance their lives in this world, producing elegant jewelry, finely carved and inlaid furniture, and cosmetic vessels and implements made from a wide range of materials.","input":"What is the old kingdom of egypt known for?"},{"output":"Ken Cheveldayoff","context":"The 2018 Saskatchewan Party leadership election will be held on January 27, 2018[1] due to the announcement on August 10, 2017 by Brad Wall that he will be retiring from politics once his successor is chosen.[2] The winner will succeed Wall as Premier of Saskatchewan.\\r\\nThe leadership election will be conducted by a one member-one vote preferential ballot system with voters able to either mail-in ballots or vote in person.[3] Candidates have a $250,000 campaign expense limit and will be required to disclose the names of contributors who donate $250 or more.

When asked where they live, Lower Peninsula residents may hold up their right palm and point to a spot on it to indicate the location.[1] The peninsula is sometimes divided into the Northern Lower Peninsulawhich is more sparsely populated and largely forestedand the Southern Lower Peninsulawhich is largely urban or farmland.\\r\\nThe Lower Peninsula dominates Michigan politics, and maps of it without the Upper Peninsula are sometimes presented as \\"Michigan\\", which contribute to resentment by \\"Yoopers\\" (residents of \\"the U.P\\").[2][3] Yoopers jokingly refer to residents of the Lower Peninsula as \\"flat-landers\\" (referring to the region's less rugged terrain) or \\"trolls\\" (because, living south of the Mackinac Bridge, they \\"live under the bridge\\").[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lower Peninsula is bounded on the south by the states of Indiana and Ohio.

It contains nearly two-thirds of Michigan's total land area. The surface of the peninsula is generally level, broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually not more than a few hundred feet tall. The western coast features extensive sandy beaches and dunes. It is divided by a low water divide running north and south. The larger portion of the state is on the west of this and gradually slopes toward Lake Michigan. The highest point in the Lower Peninsula is not definitely established but is either Briar Hill at 1,705 feet (520 m), or one of several points nearby in the vicinity of Cadillac.

ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle.[2] When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. When the body's glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, calcium enters the cytosol after death. Calcium is released into the cytosol due to the deterioration of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Also, the breakdown of the sarcolemma causes additional calcium to enter the cytosol. The calcium activates the formation of actin-myosin cross-bridging. Once calcium is introduced into the cytosol, it binds to the troponin of thin filaments, which causes the troponin-tropomyosin complex to change shape and allow the myosin heads to bind to the active sites of actin proteins.[1] In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nNormal relaxation would occur by replacing ADP with ATP, which would destabilize the myosin-actin bond and break the cross-bridge.[1] However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax.[4][5] Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs 48 to 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of death, a condition called \\"primary flaccidity\\" occurs. Following this, the muscles stiffen in rigor mortis. All muscles in the body are affected. Starting between two and six hours following death, rigor mortis begins with the eyelids, neck, and jaw. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers.\\r\\n\\r\\nRigor mortis then spreads to the other muscles, including the internal organs, within the next four to six hours. The onset of rigor mortis is affected by the individual's age, sex, physical condition, and muscular build. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nRigor mortis is very important in meat technology. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determine the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15?C (59?F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length. \\r\\n\\r\\nCold shortening is caused by the release of stored calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle fibers, in response to the cold stimulus. The calcium ions trigger powerful muscle contraction aided by ATP molecules. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after slaughter and skinning. In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe degree of rigor mortis may be used in forensic pathology, to determine the approximate time of death. A dead body holds its position as rigor mortis sets in. If the body is moved after death, but before rigor mortis begins, forensic techniques such as livor mortis can be applied.  If the position in which a body is found does not match the location where it is found (for example, if it is flat on its back with one arm sticking straight up), that could mean someone moved it. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral factors also affect the progression of rigor mortis, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. When conditions are warm, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay.  Low temperatures, however, slow them down. Therefore, for a person who dies outside in frozen conditions rigor mortis may last several days more than normal, so investigators may have to abandon it as a tool for determining time of death.[8][9]","input":"How long does it take for rigor mortis to set in in animals?"},{"output":"typically 10 ÿ 12 weeks","context":"","input":"How many weeks is a quarter in college?"},{"output":"under Trajan (reigned 98ÿ117)","context":"","input":"When was the roman empire at its peak?"},{"output":"December 19, 2018","context":"Mary Poppins Returns is an upcoming American musical fantasy film directed by Rob Marshall and written by David Magee, from a story by Magee, Marshall, and John DeLuca.

Marcos would win his election bid and work on the theater started with the issuance of Presidential Proclamation No. 20 on March 12, 1966.[5] Imelda, now the First Lady, persuaded the Philippine-American Cultural Foundation to relocate and expand plans for the still-born theater to a new reclaimed location along Roxas Boulevard in Manila. To formalize the project, President Marcos issued Executive Order No. 60, establishing the Cultural Center of the Philippines and appointing its board of directors. The board would elect Imelda as chairperson, giving her the legal mandate to negotiate and manage funds for the center.[6][8]\\r\\nPrior to her husband's inaugural, Marcos already started fund raising for the Cultural Center; an initial half-a-million Pesos was made from the proceeds of the premiere of Flower Drum Song in the University of the Philippines, and another ninety-thousand Pesos turned over from the Filipino arm of the Philippine-American Cultural Foundation. This was, however, insufficient to cover the projected cost of PH?15 million needed to construct the theater. Much of the theater's funding came from a war damage fund for education authorized by the US Congress during President Marcos's state visit to the United States. In the end, the theater would receive US$3.5 million from the fund. To make up for the rest of the construction costs, Imelda approached prominent families and businesses to donate to her cause. Carpets, draperies, marble, artworks to decorate the interior of the theater and even cement were all donated. Despite the success of the First Lady's fund raising, the project cost ballooned to almost ?50 million, or 35 million over the projected budget by 1969. Imelda and the CCP board took a US$7 million loan through the National Investment Development Corporation to finance the remaining amount, a move that was heavily criticized by government opposition. Senator Ninoy Aquino strongly objected to the use of public funds for the center without congressional appropriation and branded it as an institution for the elite.[6] Unfazed with the criticism, Marcos went ahead with the project and the Theater of Performing Arts (Now the Tanghalang Pambansa) of the Cultural Center of the Philippines was opened on September 8, 1969, three days before the President's 52nd birthday, with a three-month-long inaugural festival opened by Lamberto Avellana's musical Golden Salakot: Isang Dularawan, an epic portrayal of Panay Island. Among those who attended the inaugural night were California Governor Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, both representing United States President Richard Nixon.[9]\\r\\nEarly into the 1970s, the Center was in the red mainly due to the costs of constructing the Theater of Performing Arts. In 1972, the board of the CCP asked Members of Congress to pass House Bill 4454, which would convert the Center to become a non-municipal public corporation and allow it to use the principal of the CCP Trust Fund to pay off some of its debt. The bill would also continually support the center through a government subsidy amounting to the equivalent of 5% of the collected Amusement Tax annually. The proposed piece of legislation was met with strong opposition and was never passed. However, with the declaration of Martial Law on September 23, 1972, Congress was effectively dissolved; and President Marcos signed Proclamation No. 15 s. 1972, essentially a modified version of the proposed bill. The proclamation also expanded the Center's role, from that of being a performance venue to an agency promoting and developing arts and culture throughout the country.[2] Other notable developments during the year included the institution of the National Artist Awards and the foundation of the CCP Philharmonic Orchestra, the center's first resident company that would later become the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra.[5]\\r\\nDuring this period of the Marcos Presidency, the CCP Complex played host to major local and international events under the guise of the Bagong Lipunan (New Society), which would mark the start of a series of major construction projects in the area. When Filipino Margie Moran won the 1973 Miss Universe Pageant, the Philippine Government agreed to stage the succeeding year's contest, and plans for an amphitheater commenced. Weeks of planning and discussions resulted to the commissioning of the Folk Arts Theater (Now the Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas), an open-air but roofed structure that could seat up to 10,000 people. Construction of the new theater, which was also designed by Leandro Locsin, was completed in a record 77 days and was inaugurated on July 1972 with the grand parade, \\"Kasaysayan ng Lahi\\" (\\"History of the Race\\").[6][10] Right after the inauguration of Folk Arts, ground was broken for the Philippine International Convention Center and the Philippine Plaza Hotel, both for the country's hosting of the IMF-World Bank Annual Meeting in 1976. Although not owned by the Cultural Center, these buildings were nevertheless built at the complex and designed by Locsin. One of the more infamous additions to the Center was the Manila Film Center, built in 1981 for the Manila International Film Festival. Designed by Froilan Hong, the structure was built on a strict critical path schedule requiring 4,000 workers working in 3 shifts across 24 hours. An accident occurred on November 17, 1981, when scaffolding collapsed and sent construction workers into quick-drying cement. Despite this, construction proceeded, and finished some 15 minutes before opening night of the Film Festival.[6] The building's ownership would be transferred to the CCP in 1986, when the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines was dissolved.[5] Straying from the brutalist style typical of the buildings in the CCP is the Coconut Palace, a showcase on the versatility of coconut as an export product and construction material, designed by Francisco Ma?osa. The financial and human costs of constructing these buildings, in a time of widespread poverty and corruption, was seen as symptomatic of the First Lady's edifice complex, a charge Imelda has nevertheless welcomed in her later years.[6][11]\\r\\n1986 saw the end of the Marcos regime through the peaceful People Power Revolution. Consequently, the CCP underwent a period of reform and \\"Filipinization\\". President Corazon Aquino appointed Maria Teresa Roxas as the first President of the Cultural Center in the post-Marcos era; and once critic of the center for its promotion of elitist culture, Nicanor Tiongson, accepted the position to be the new artistic director. Together with its vice president, Florendo Garcia, the new leadership consulted with various stakeholders to formulate a new direction for the CCP and officially redefine its mission and objectives in pursuit of \\"a Filipino national culture evolving with and for the people\\".[12] To set about decentralization, the Center formulates guidelines for setting-up local arts councils in local government units and establishes the CCP Exchange Artist Program to provide opportunities for regional groups to showcase their talents across the country. For the first time in her presidency, Aquino visited the center on January 11, 1987 to confer the National Artist Award to Atang de la Rama, marking the first time the awards were conferred through a process of democratic selection in addition to rigid criteria.[12] Aquino would later confer the same award to Leandro Locsin in 1990, in recognition of his contribution to the field of architecture in the Philippines and in spite of his many contributions to the Marcos regime's architectural projects. Also in 1987, three groups joined the roster of the Cultural Center's resident companies: the Philippine Ballet Theatre, the Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group and Tanghalang Pilipino.[5] As part of its outreach and research programs, the CCP produced a number of notable publications, including: Ani (English: Harvest) (1987), an arts journal; the Tuklas Sining (English: Discover Arts) (1989) series of monographs and videos on Philippine arts and the landmark 10-volume CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art (1994).[12][13] Despite its attempt at reforms, some people still see the center in a less positive light. For instance, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said that she finds the CCP to be \\"imposing, unapproachable, and elitist\\" for Filipino masses.[14]\\r\\nThe scope of activities the center engages in include architecture, film and broadcast arts, dance, literature, music, new media, theatre and visual arts. Aside from the its promotion of local and indigenous artists, it has played host to numerous prominent and international artists like Van Cliburn, Plcido Domingo, Marcel Marceau, the Bolshoi Ballet, the Kirov Ballet, the Royal Ballet, the Royal Danish Ballet, the New York Philharmonic, and the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra among many others.\\r\\nFrom 1972, the CCP administered the Order of the National Artists, which is the highest recognition the government of the Philippines gives to individuals who made significant contributions to the development of arts in the country. The Order was established in 1972 after the death of renowned painter Fernando Amorsolo, through the auspices of Proclamation No. 1001.[15] A year later, the Board of Trustees of the Center was designated as the National Artists Award Committee.[16] Today, the CCP administers the Order in conjunction with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts.\\r\\nSince its reform for democratization in 1986, the center has undertaken steps to bring culture and arts more accessible to a larger segment of the Filipino society. Its Outreach Program conducts fora and art appreciation activities in various parts of the country, which includes the Sopas, Sining at Sorbetes Program (English: Food to Taste, Arts to Appreciate. Literally, Soup, Art and Ice Cream), a unique appreciation activity coupled with a feeding program for underprivileged youth.[17] Every year since 2005, the center organizes its open house festival, Pasinaya (English: To Show. Literally, Debut or Inauguration) during February, designated as the National Arts Month in the Philippines. The Pasinaya festival features performing arts group from all over the country, led by the center's resident companies, in a one-day showcase of local talent entirely held in the Tanghalang Pambansa's numerous venues. In 2007 alone, the festival was visited by some 10,000 people.[18] The CCP also provides institutional support to the Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival and the Philippine High School for the Arts.\\r\\nThey also have a ballet performance adaptation of Don Quixote written by Miguel de Cervantes every February[19][20]\\r\\nThe President and Chief Operating Officer is Arsenio \\"Nick\\" Lizaso, while Chris Millado is Vice President and Artistic Director.[21] The Board of Trustees is chaired by Emily Abrera. The other Board members are:[22]\\r\\nAdvisers\\r\\nPresidents of the CCP[23]\\r\\nThe Cultural Center owns and operates several performance venues in the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex located in the reclaimed area shared between Pasay and Manila known as Bay City. Its flagship venue is the Tanghalang Pambansa (National Theater) which also houses its principal offices. The Tanghalang Pambansa contains the Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo (Main Theater), Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino (Little Theater), and the Tanghalang Huseng Batute (Studio Theater).\\r\\nAlso located in the CCP Complex is the Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas (Folk Arts Theater).\\r\\nThe Cultural Center of the Philippines administers the National Arts Center, a 13.5 hectare complex at the Makiling Forest Reservation in Los Ba?os, Laguna. The complex hosts the Philippine High School for the Arts. Its flagship venue is the Tanghalang Maria Makiling, an open-air auditorium that can seat up to 1,800 people. The theater, which was also designed by Leandro V. Locsin, sits on a square plan dominated by a soaring pyramidal roof clad in clay tiles, a more literal interpretation of indigenous Filipino architecture when compared to the architect's previous works for the CCP.\\r\\nIn response to the need to widen its audience for the arts and to bring its programs closer to the people, the CCP has established a programmatic partnership with the Assumption Antipolo and De La Salle Santiago-Zobel School (DLSZ) in Alabang, Muntinlupa. As CCP's Satellite Venues in the East and in the South, these institutions commit to benefit from the exchange of goodwill and assistance through move-over productions, performances, and artistic training workshops. Eventually, the center hopes to establish another satellite venue in the Northern part of Metro Manila.\\r\\nDe La Salle-Santiago Zobel School established the Angelo King Center for the Performing Arts in 2000 with the aim of supporting the holistic development of its students. The Center pushed the development of theatrical and musical talents on campus.\\r\\nThe Assumpta Theater was constructed in 1999 and inaugurated in 2001 and is located on the campus of Assumption Antipolo. It was envisioned to be a major cultural seat in eastern Metro Manila and to serve as a venue for cultural education and development not only of its students, faculty and parents but also for members of outside communities and schools neighboring municipalities of the Rizal Province.\\r\\nThe Assumpta Theater is home to modern light and sound equipment, 17 manual fly battens, a manual curtain system, a spacious stage area, an orchestra pit, fully air-conditioned dressing rooms, a docking area, stage wings, three-level seating arrangements, a lobby, and comfort rooms. The house area can accommodate 2,001 guests.","input":"Who established the cultural center of the philippines?"},{"output":"59 million words","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is the principal historical dictionary of the English language, published by Oxford University Press. It traces the historical development of the English language, providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world.[2][3] The second edition, comprising 21,728 pages in 20 volumes, was published in 1989.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork began on the dictionary in 1857, but it was only in 1884 that it began to be published in unbound fascicles as work continued on the project, under the name of A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society. In 1895, the title The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) was first used unofficially on the covers of the series, and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in ten bound volumes. In 1933, the title The Oxford English Dictionary fully replaced the former name in all occurrences in its reprinting as twelve volumes with a one-volume supplement. More supplements came over the years until 1989, when the second edition was published.[1] Since 2000, compilation of a third edition of the dictionary has been underway, approximately half of which is complete.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first electronic version of the dictionary was made available in 1988. The online version has been available since 2000, and as of April 2014 was receiving over two million hits per month. The third edition of the dictionary will most likely only appear in electronic form: the Chief Executive of Oxford University Press has stated that it is unlikely that it will ever be printed.[1][4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a historical dictionary, the Oxford English Dictionary explains words by showing their development rather than merely their present-day usages.[6] Therefore, it shows definitions in the order that the sense of the word began being used, including word meanings which are no longer used. Each definition is shown with numerous short usage quotations; in each case, the first quotation shows the first recorded instance of the word that the editors are aware of and, in the case of words and senses no longer in current usage, the last quotation is the last known recorded usage. This allows the reader to get an approximate sense of the time period in which a particular word has been in use, and additional quotations help the reader to ascertain information about how the word is used in context, beyond any explanation that the dictionary editors can provide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe format of the OED's entries has influenced numerous other historical lexicography projects. The forerunners to the OED, such as the early volumes of the Deutsches W?rterbuch, had initially provided few quotations from a limited number of sources, whereas the OED editors preferred larger groups of quite short quotations from a wide selection of authors and publications. This influenced later volumes of this and other lexicographical works.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the publishers, it would take a single person 120 years to \\"key in\\" the 59 million words of the OED second edition, 60 years to proofread them, and 540 megabytes to store them electronically.[8] As of 30 November 2005, the Oxford English Dictionary contained approximately 301,100 main entries. Supplementing the entry headwords, there are 157,000 bold-type combinations and derivatives;[9] 169,000 italicized-bold phrases and combinations;[10] 616,500 word-forms in total, including 137,000 pronunciations; 249,300 etymologies; 577,000 cross-references; and 2,412,400 usage quotations. The dictionary's latest, complete print edition (second edition, 1989) was printed in 20 volumes, comprising 291,500 entries in 21,730 pages. The longest entry in the OED2 was for the verb set, which required 60,000 words to describe some 430 senses. As entries began to be revised for the OED3 in sequence starting from M, the longest entry became make in 2000, then put in 2007, then run in 2011.[11][12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its considerable size, the OED is neither the world's largest nor the earliest exhaustive dictionary of a language. Another earlier large dictionary is the Grimm brothers' dictionary of the German language, begun in 1838 and completed in 1961. The first edition of the Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca is the first great dictionary devoted to a modern European language (Italian) and was published in 1612; the first edition of Dictionnaire de l'Acadmie fran?aise dates from 1694. The official dictionary of Spanish is the Diccionario de la lengua espa?ola (produced, edited, and published by the Real Academia Espa?ola), and its first edition was published in 1780. The Kangxi dictionary of Chinese was published in 1716.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dictionary began as a Philological Society project of a small group of intellectuals in London (and unconnected to Oxford University):[15]:103ÿ4,112 Richard Chenevix Trench, Herbert Coleridge, and Frederick Furnivall, who were dissatisfied with the existing English dictionaries. The Society expressed interest in compiling a new dictionary as early as 1844,[16] but it was not until June 1857 that they began by forming an \\"Unregistered Words Committee\\" to search for words that were unlisted or poorly defined in current dictionaries. In November, Trench's report was not a list of unregistered words; instead, it was the study On Some Deficiencies in our English Dictionaries, which identified seven distinct shortcomings in contemporary dictionaries:[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Society ultimately realized that the number of unlisted words would be far more than the number of words in the English dictionaries of the 19th century, and shifted their idea from covering only words that were not already in English dictionaries to a larger project. Trench suggested that a new, truly comprehensive dictionary was needed. On 7 January 1858, the Society formally adopted the idea of a comprehensive new dictionary.[15]:107ÿ8 Volunteer readers would be assigned particular books, copying passages illustrating word usage onto quotation slips. Later the same year, the Society agreed to the project in principle, with the title A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (NED).[18]:ixÿx\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Chenevix Trench (1807ÿ1886) played the key role in the project's first months, but his Church of England appointment as Dean of Westminster meant that he could not give the dictionary project the time that it required. He withdrew and Herbert Coleridge became the first editor.[19]:8ÿ9\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 May 1860, Coleridge's dictionary plan was published and research was started. His house was the first editorial office. He arrayed 100,000 quotation slips in a 54 pigeon-hole grid.[19]:9 In April 1861, the group published the first sample pages; later that month, Coleridge died of tuberculosis, aged 30.[18]:x\\r\\n\\r\\nFurnivall then became editor; he was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but temperamentally ill-suited for the work.[15]:110 Many volunteer readers eventually lost interest in the project, as Furnivall failed to keep them motivated. Furthermore, many of the slips were misplaced.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurnivall believed that, since many printed texts from earlier centuries were not readily available, it would be impossible for volunteers to efficiently locate the quotations that the dictionary needed. As a result, he founded the Early English Text Society in 1864 and the Chaucer Society in 1868 to publish old manuscripts.[18]:xii Furnivall's preparatory efforts lasted 21 years and provided numerous texts for the use and enjoyment of the general public, as well as crucial sources for lexicographers, but they did not actually involve compiling a dictionary. Furnivall recruited more than 800 volunteers to read these texts and record quotations. While enthusiastic, the volunteers were not well trained and often made inconsistent and arbitrary selections. Ultimately, Furnivall handed over nearly two tons of quotation slips and other materials to his successor.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1870s, Furnivall unsuccessfully attempted to recruit both Henry Sweet and Henry Nicol to succeed him. He then approached James Murray, who accepted the post of editor. In the late 1870s, Furnivall and Murray met with several publishers about publishing the dictionary. In 1878, Oxford University Press agreed with Murray to proceed with the massive project; the agreement was formalized the following year.[15]:111ÿ2 The dictionary project finally had a publisher 20 years after the idea was conceived. It was another 50 years before the entire dictionary was complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in his editorship, Murray learned that a prolific reader named W. C. Minor was a criminal lunatic.[15]:xiii  Minor was a Yale University-trained surgeon and military officer in the American Civil War, and was confined to Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane after killing a man in London. Minor invented his own quotation-tracking system, allowing him to submit slips on specific words in response to editors' requests. The story of Murray and Minor later served as the central focus of The Surgeon of Crowthorne (US title: The Professor and the Madman[15]), a popular book about the creation of the OED.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1870s, the Philological Society was concerned with the process of publishing a dictionary with such an immense scope.[1] They had pages printed by publishers, but no publication agreement was reached; both the Cambridge University Press and the Oxford University Press were approached. The OUP finally agreed in 1879 (after two years of negotiating by Sweet, Furnivall, and Murray) to publish the dictionary and to pay Murray, who was both the editor and the Philological Society president. The dictionary was to be published as interval fascicles, with the final form in four volumes, totalling 6,400 pages. They hoped to finish the project in ten years.[19]:1\\r\\n\\r\\nMurray started the project, working in a corrugated iron outbuilding called the \\"Scriptorium\\" which was lined with wooden planks, book shelves, and 1,029 pigeon-holes for the quotation slips.[18]:xiii He tracked and regathered Furnivall's collection of quotation slips, which were found to concentrate on rare, interesting words rather than common usages. For instance, there were ten times as many quotations for abusion as for abuse.[21] He appealed, through newspapers distributed to bookshops and libraries, for readers who would report \\"as many quotations as you can for ordinary words\\" and for words that were \\"rare, obsolete, old-fashioned, new, peculiar or used in a peculiar way\\".[22] Murray had American philologist and liberal arts college professor Francis March manage the collection in North America; 1,000 quotation slips arrived daily to the Scriptorium and, by 1880, there were 2,500,000.[19]:15\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first dictionary fascicle was published on 1 February 1884twenty-three years after Coleridge's sample pages. The full title was A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society; the 352-page volume, words from A to Ant, cost 12s 6d.[19]:251 (or about $668.24 in 2013) The total sales were only 4,000 copies.[23]:169\\r\\n\\r\\nThe OUP saw that it would take too long to complete the work with unrevised editorial arrangements. Accordingly, new assistants were hired and two new demands were made on Murray.[19]:32ÿ33 The first was that he move from Mill Hill to Oxford, which he did in 1885. Murray had his Scriptorium re-erected on his new property.[18]:xvii\\r\\n\\r\\nMurray resisted the second demand: that if he could not meet schedule, he must hire a second, senior editor to work in parallel to him, outside his supervision, on words from elsewhere in the alphabet. Murray did not want to share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience. That turned out not to be so, and Philip Gell of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant Henry Bradley (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the British Museum in London beginning in 1888. In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nGell continued harassing Murray and Bradley with his business concernscontaining costs and speeding productionto the point where the project's collapse seemed likely. Newspapers reported the harassment, particularly the Saturday Review, and public opinion backed the editors.[23]:182ÿ83 Gell was fired, and the university reversed his cost policies. If the editors felt that the dictionary would have to grow larger, it would; it was an important work, and worth the time and money to properly finish.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Murray nor Bradley lived to see it. Murray died in 1915, having been responsible for words starting with AÿD, HÿK, OÿP, and T, nearly half the finished dictionary; Bradley died in 1923, having completed EÿG, LÿM, SÿSh, St, and WÿWe. By then, two additional editors had been promoted from assistant work to independent work, continuing without much trouble. William Craigie started in 1901 and was responsible for N, QÿR, SiÿSq, UÿV, and WoÿWy.[18]:xix The OUP had previously thought London too far from Oxford but, after 1925, Craigie worked on the dictionary in Chicago, where he was a professor.[18]:xix[19] The fourth editor was Charles Talbut Onions, who compiled the remaining ranges starting in 1914: SuÿSz, WhÿWo, and XÿZ.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1919ÿ1920, J. R. R. Tolkien was employed by the OED, researching etymologies of the Waggle to Warlock range;[25] later he parodied the principal editors as \\"The Four Wise Clerks of Oxenford\\" in the story Farmer Giles of Ham.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy early 1894, a total of 11 fascicles had been published, or about one per year: four for AÿB, five for C, and two for E.[18] Of these, eight were 352 pages long, while the last one in each group was shorter to end at the letter break (which eventually became a volume break). At this point, it was decided to publish the work in smaller and more frequent instalments; once every three months beginning in 1895 there would be a fascicle of 64 pages, priced at 2s 6d. If enough material was ready, 128 or even 192 pages would be published together. This pace was maintained until World War I forced reductions in staff.[18]:xx Each time enough consecutive pages were available, the same material was also published in the original larger fascicles.[18]:xx Also in 1895, the title Oxford English Dictionary (OED) was first used. It then appeared only on the outer covers of the fascicles; the original title was still the official one and was used everywhere else.[18]:xx\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 125th and last fascicle covered words from Wise to the end of W and was published on 19 April 1928, and the full dictionary in bound volumes followed immediately.[18]:xx\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Shakespeare is the most-quoted writer in the completed dictionary, with Hamlet his most-quoted work. George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) is the most-quoted female writer. Collectively, the Bible is the most-quoted work (but in many different translations); the most-quoted single work is Cursor Mundi.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1928 and 1933, enough additional material had been compiled to make a one-volume supplement, so the dictionary was reissued as the set of 12 volumes and a one-volume supplement in 1933.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1933, Oxford had finally put the dictionary to rest; all work ended, and the quotation slips went into storage. However, the English language continued to change and, by the time 20 years had passed, the dictionary was outdated.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were three possible ways to update it. The cheapest would have been to leave the existing work alone and simply compile a new supplement of perhaps one or two volumes; but then anyone looking for a word or sense and unsure of its age would have to look in three different places. The most convenient choice for the user would have been for the entire dictionary to be re-edited and retypeset, with each change included in its proper alphabetical place; but this would have been the most expensive option, with perhaps 15 volumes required to be produced. The OUP chose a middle approach: combining the new material with the existing supplement to form a larger replacement supplement.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Burchfield was hired in 1957 to edit the second supplement;[28] Onions turned 84 that year but was still able to make some contributions as well. The work on the supplement was expected to take about seven years.[27] It actually took 29 years, by which time the new supplement (OEDS) had grown to four volumes, starting with A, H, O, and Sea. They were published in 1972, 1976, 1982, and 1986 respectively, bringing the complete dictionary to 16 volumes, or 17 counting the first supplement.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurchfield emphasized the inclusion of modern-day language and, through the supplement, the dictionary was expanded to include a wealth of new words from the burgeoning fields of science and technology, as well as popular culture and colloquial speech. Burchfield said that he broadened the scope to include developments of the language in English-speaking regions beyond the United Kingdom, including North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and the Caribbean. Burchfield also removed, for unknown reasons, many entries that had been added to the 1933 supplement.[29] In 2012, an analysis by lexicographer Sarah Ogilvie revealed that many of these entries were in fact foreign loanwords, despite Burchfield's claim that he included more such words. The proportion was estimated from a sample calculation to amount to 17% of the foreign loan words and words from regional forms of English. Some of these had only a single recorded usage, but many had multiple recorded citations, and it ran against what was thought to be the established OED editorial practice and a perception that he had opened up the dictionary to \\"World English\\".[30][31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time the new supplement was completed, it was clear that the full text of the dictionary would need to be computerized. Achieving this would require retyping it once, but thereafter it would always be accessible for computer searching?ÿ as well as for whatever new editions of the dictionary might be desired, starting with an integration of the supplementary volumes and the main text. Preparation for this process began in 1983, and editorial work started the following year under the administrative direction of Timothy J. Benbow, with John A. Simpson and Edmund S. C. Weiner as co-editors.[33] In 2016, Simpson published his memoir chronicling his years at the OED. See The Word Detective: Searching for the Meaning of It All at the Oxford English Dictionary ÿ A Memoir. Basic Books, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus began the New Oxford English Dictionary (NOED) project. In the United States, more than 120 typists of the International Computaprint Corporation (now Reed Tech) started keying in over 350,000,000 characters, their work checked by 55 proof-readers in England.[33] Retyping the text alone was not sufficient; all the information represented by the complex typography of the original dictionary had to be retained, which was done by marking up the content in SGML.[33] A specialized search engine and display software were also needed to access it. Under a 1985 agreement, some of this software work was done at the University of Waterloo, Canada, at the Centre for the New Oxford English Dictionary, led by Frank Tompa and Gaston Gonnet; this search technology went on to become the basis for the Open Text Corporation.[34] Computer hardware, database and other software, development managers, and programmers for the project were donated by the British subsidiary of IBM; the colour syntax-directed editor for the project, LEXX, was written by Mike Cowlishaw of IBM.[35] The University of Waterloo, in Canada, volunteered to design the database. A. Walton Litz, an English professor at Princeton University who served on the Oxford University Press advisory council, was quoted in Time as saying \\"I've never been associated with a project, I've never even heard of a project, that was so incredibly complicated and that met every deadline.\\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1989, the NOED project had achieved its primary goals, and the editors, working online, had successfully combined the original text, Burchfield's supplement, and a small amount of newer material, into a single unified dictionary. The word \\"new\\" was again dropped from the name, and the second edition of the OED, or the OED2, was published. The first edition retronymically became the OED1.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary 2 was printed in 20 volumes.[1] For the first time, there was no attempt to start them on letter boundaries, and they were made roughly equal in size. The 20 volumes started with A, B.B.C., Cham, Creel, Dvandva, Follow, Hat, Interval, Look, Moul, Ow, Poise, Quemadero, Rob, Ser, Soot, Su, Thru, Unemancipated, and Wave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe content of the OED2 is mostly just a reorganization of the earlier corpus, but the retypesetting provided an opportunity for two long-needed format changes. The headword of each entry was no longer capitalized, allowing the user to readily see those words that actually require a capital letter.[37] Murray had devised his own notation for pronunciation, there being no standard available at the time, whereas the OED2 adopted the modern International Phonetic Alphabet.[37][38] Unlike the earlier edition, all foreign alphabets except Greek were transliterated.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British quiz show Countdown has awarded the leather-bound complete version to the champions of each series since its inception in 1982.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the print version of the second edition was published in 1989, the response was enthusiastic. Author Anthony Burgess declared it \\"the greatest publishing event of the century\\", as quoted by the Los Angeles Times.[40] Time dubbed the book \\"a scholarly Everest\\",[36] and Richard Boston, writing for The Guardian, called it \\"one of the wonders of the world\\".[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supplements and their integration into the second edition were a great improvement to the OED as a whole, but it was recognized that most of the entries were still fundamentally unaltered from the first edition. Much of the information in the dictionary published in 1989 was already decades out of date, though the supplements had made good progress towards incorporating new vocabulary. Yet many definitions contained disproven scientific theories, outdated historical information, and moral values that were no longer widely accepted.[42][43] Furthermore, the supplements had failed to recognize many words in the existing volumes as obsolete by the time of the second edition's publication, meaning that thousands of words were marked as current despite no recent evidence of their use.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, it was recognized that work on a third edition would have to begin to rectify these problems.[42] The first attempt to produce a new edition came with the Oxford English Dictionary Additions Series, a new set of supplements to complement the OED2 with the intention of producing a third edition from them.[45] The previous supplements appeared in alphabetical installments, whereas the new series had a full AÿZ range of entries within each individual volume, with a complete alphabetical index at the end of all words revised so far, each listed with the volume number which contained the revised entry.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in the end only three Additions volumes were published this way, two in 1993 and one in 1997,[46][47][48] each containing about 3,000 new definitions.[8] The possibilities of the World Wide Web and new computer technology in general meant that the processes of researching the dictionary and of publishing new and revised entries could be vastly improved. New text search databases offered vastly more material for the editors of the dictionary to work with, and with publication on the Web as a possibility, the editors could publish revised entries much more quickly and easily than ever before.[49] A new approach was called for, and for this reason it was decided to embark on a new, complete revision of the dictionary.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with the launch of the first OED Online site in 2000, the editors of the dictionary began a major revision project to create a completely revised third edition of the dictionary (OED3), expected to be completed in 2037[50][51] at a projected cost of about S34 million.[52][1]\\r\\n\\r\\nRevisions were started at the letter M, with new material appearing every three months on the OED Online website. The editors chose to start the revision project from the middle of the dictionary in order that the overall quality of entries be made more even, since the later entries in the OED1 generally tended to be better than the earlier ones. However, in March 2008, the editors announced that they would alternate each quarter between moving forward in the alphabet as before and updating \\"key English words from across the alphabet, along with the other words which make up the alphabetical cluster surrounding them\\".[53] With the relaunch of the OED Online website in December 2010, alphabetical revision was abandoned altogether.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe revision is expected to roughly double the dictionary in size.[5][55] Apart from general updates to include information on new words and other changes in the language, the third edition brings many other improvements, including changes in formatting and stylistic conventions to make entries clearer to read and enable more thorough searches to be made by computer, more thorough etymological information, and a general change of focus away from individual words towards more general coverage of the language as a whole.[49][56] While the original text drew its quotations mainly from literary sources such as novels, plays, and poetry, with additional material from newspapers and academic journals, the new edition will reference more kinds of material that were unavailable to the editors of previous editions, such as wills, inventories, account books, diaries, journals, and letters.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Simpson was the first chief editor of the OED3. He retired in 2013 and was replaced by Michael Proffitt, who is the eighth chief editor of the dictionary.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production of the new edition takes full advantage of computer technology, particularly since the June 2005 inauguration of the whimsically named \\"Perfect All-Singing All-Dancing Editorial and Notation Application\\", or \\"Pasadena\\". With this XML-based system, the attention of lexicographers can be directed more to matters of content than to presentation issues such as the numbering of definitions. The new system has also simplified the use of the quotations database, and enabled staff in New York to work directly on the dictionary in the same way as their Oxford-based counterparts.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther important computer uses include internet searches for evidence of current usage, and email submissions of quotations by readers and the general public.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nWordhunt was a 2005 appeal to the general public for help in providing citations for 50 selected recent words, and produced antedatings for many. The results were reported in a BBC TV series, Balderdash and Piffle. The OED's small army of devoted readers continue to contribute quotations: the department currently receives about 200,000 a year.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nOED currently contains over 600,000 entries.[61] They update the OED on a quarterly basis to make up for its Third Edition revising their existing entries and adding new words and senses.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2018, more than 1,400 new words, senses, and sub-entries have been added[63] to the OED including \\"idiocracy\\", \\"nothingburger\\" and \\"bummock\\". Words related to film terms were also joined[64]. Additionally, Filipino words were listed[65] in the dictionary like \\"bongga\\" and \\"trapo\\". \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1971, the 13-volume OED1 (1933) was reprinted as a two-volume Compact Edition, by photographically reducing each page to one-half its linear dimensions; each compact edition page held four OED1 pages in a four-up (\\"4-up\\") format. The two volume letters were A and P; the first supplement was at the second volume's end. The Compact Edition included, in a small slip-case drawer, a magnifying glass to help in reading reduced type. Many copies were inexpensively distributed through book clubs. In 1987, the second supplement was published as a third volume to the Compact Edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, for the 20-volume OED2 (1989), the compact edition format was re-sized to one-third of original linear dimensions, a nine-up (\\"9-up\\") format requiring greater magnification, but allowing publication of a single-volume dictionary. It was accompanied by a magnifying glass as before and A User's Guide to the \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\", by Donna Lee Berg.[66] After these volumes were published, though, book club offers commonly continued to sell the two-volume 1971 Compact Edition.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the text of the dictionary was digitized and online, it was also available to be published on CD-ROM. The text of the first edition was made available in 1987.[67] Afterward, three versions of the second edition were issued. Version 1 (1992) was identical in content to the printed second edition, and the CD itself was not copy-protected. Version 2 (1999) included the Oxford English Dictionary Additions of 1993 and 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nVersion 3.0 was released in 2002 with additional words from the OED3 and software improvements. Version 3.1.1 (2007) added support for hard disk installation, so that the user does not have to insert the CD to use the dictionary. It has been reported that this version will work on operating systems other than Microsoft Windows, using emulation programs.[68][69] Version 4.0 of the CD has been available since June 2009 and works with Windows 7 and Mac OS X (10.4 or later).[70] This version uses the CD drive for installation, running only from the hard drive.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 March 2000, the Oxford English Dictionary Online (OED Online) became available to subscribers.[71] The online database contains the entire OED2 and is updated quarterly with revisions that will be included in the OED3 (see above). The online edition is the most up-to-date version of the dictionary available. The OED web site is not optimized for mobile devices, but the developers have stated that there are plans to provide an API that would enable developers to develop different interfaces for querying the OED.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe price for an individual to use this edition is S195 or US$295 every year, even after a reduction in 2004; consequently, most subscribers are large organizations such as universities. Some public libraries and companies have subscribed, as well, including public libraries in the United Kingdom, where access is funded by the Arts Council,[73] and public libraries in New Zealand.[74][75] Individuals who belong to a library which subscribes to the service are able to use the service from their own home without charge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe OED's utility and renown as a historical dictionary have led to numerous offspring projects and other dictionaries bearing the Oxford name, though not all are directly related to the OED itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, originally started in 1902 and completed in 1933,[77] is an abridgement of the full work that retains the historical focus, but does not include any words which were obsolete before 1700 except those used by Shakespeare, Milton, Spenser, and the King James Bible.[78] A completely new edition was produced from the OED2 and published in 1993,[79] with revisions in 2002 and 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Concise Oxford Dictionary is a different work, which aims to cover current English only, without the historical focus. The original edition, mostly based on the OED1, was edited by Francis George Fowler and Henry Watson Fowler and published in 1911, before the main work was completed.[80] Revised editions appeared throughout the twentieth century to keep it up to date with changes in English usage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English was originally conceived by F. G. Fowler and H. W. Fowler to be compressed, compact, and concise.  Its primary source is the Oxford English Dictionary, and it is nominally an abridgment of the Concise Oxford Dictionary. It was first published in 1924.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998 the New Oxford Dictionary of English (NODE) was published. While also aiming to cover current English, NODE was not based on the OED. Instead, it was an entirely new dictionary produced with the aid of corpus linguistics.[82] Once NODE was published, a similarly brand-new edition of the Concise Oxford Dictionary followed, this time based on an abridgement of NODE rather than the OED; NODE (under the new title of the Oxford Dictionary of English, or ODE) continues to be principal source for Oxford's product line of current-English dictionaries, including the New Oxford American Dictionary, with the OED now only serving as the basis for scholarly historical dictionaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe OED lists British headword spellings (e.g., labour, centre) with variants following (labor, center, etc.). For the suffix more commonly spelt  -ise in British English, OUP policy dictates a preference for the spelling -ize, e.g., realize vs. realise and globalization vs. globalisation. The rationale is etymological, in that the English suffix is mainly derived from the Greek suffix -, (-izein), or the Latin -izre.[83] However, -ze is also sometimes treated as an Americanism insofar as the -ze suffix has crept into words where it did not originally belong, as with analyse (British English), which is spelt analyze in American English.[84][85]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish prime minister Stanley Baldwin described the OED as a \\"national treasure\\".[86] Author Anu Garg, founder of Wordsmith.org, has called it a \\"lex icon\\".[87] Tim Bray, co-creator of Extensible Markup Language (XML), credits the OED as the developing inspiration of that markup language.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, despite, and at the same time precisely because of, its claims of authority,[89] the dictionary has been criticised since at least the 1960s from various angles. It has become a target precisely because of its scope, its claims to authority, its British-centredness and relative neglect of World Englishes,[90] its implied but not acknowledged focus on literary language and, above all, its influence. The OED, as a commercial product, has always had to manoeuvre a thin line between PR, marketing and scholarship and one can argue that its biggest problem is the critical uptake of the work by the interested public. In his review of the 1982 supplement,[91] University of Oxford linguist Roy Harris writes that criticizing the OED is extremely difficult because \\"one is dealing not just with a dictionary but with a national institution\\", one that \\"has become, like the English monarchy, virtually immune from criticism in principle\\". He further notes that neologisms from respected \\"literary\\" authors such as Samuel Beckett and Virginia Woolf are included, whereas usage of words in newspapers or other less \\"respectable\\" sources hold less sway, even though they may be commonly used. He writes that the OED's \\"[b]lack-and-white lexicography is also black-and-white in that it takes upon itself to pronounce authoritatively on the rights and wrongs of usage\\", faulting the dictionary's prescriptive rather than descriptive usage. To Harris, this prescriptive classification of certain usages as \\"erroneous\\" and the complete omission of various forms and usages cumulatively represent the \\"social bias[es]\\" of the (presumably well-educated and wealthy) compilers. However, the identification of \\"erroneous and catachrestic\\" usages is being removed from third edition entries,[92] sometimes in favour of usage notes describing the attitudes to language which have previously led to these classifications.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nHarris also faults the editors' \\"donnish conservatism\\" and their adherence to prudish Victorian morals, citing as an example the non-inclusion of \\"various centuries-old 'four-letter words'\\" until 1972. However, no English dictionary included such words, for fear of possible prosecution under British obscenity laws, until after the conclusion of the Lady Chatterley's Lover obscenity trial in 1960. The first dictionary to include the word fuck was the Penguin English Dictionary of 1965.[94] Joseph Wright's English Dialect Dictionary had included shit in 1905.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe OED's claims of authority have also been questioned by linguists such as Pius ten Hacken, who notes that the dictionary actively strives towards definitiveness and authority but can only achieve those goals in a limited sense, given the difficulties of defining the scope of what it includes.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nFounding editor James Murray was also reluctant to include scientific terms, despite their documentation, unless he felt that they were widely enough used. In 1902, he declined to add the word \\"radium\\" to the dictionary.[97]","input":"How many words are in the oxford english dictionary?"},{"output":"Sirius","context":"This is a list of the brightest naked eye stars to +2.50 magnitude, as determined by their maximum, total or combined apparent visual magnitudes as seen from Earth.

C&G specialises in mortgages and savings products. Previously, C&G was a building society, the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society. Its headquarters were in Barnwood, Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England. C&G was closed to new mortgage[1] and savings business on 9 September 2013.\\r\\nThe branch network of Cheltenham & Gloucester was transferred to the newly established TSB Bank plc in September 2013, as part of a divestment of a significant portion of the Lloyds TSB business by Lloyds Banking Group.[2] C&G branches were rebranded under the TSB brand along with a number of Lloyds TSB branches in England and Wales. Some C&G savings accounts and mortgages were also transferred to the new TSB Bank at that time; others remained with C&G.\\r\\nIn April 2017, all remaining mortgage administration was transferred to Lloyds Bank and rebranded[3] and the only remaining products were legacy savings accounts, with the last remaining C&G Fixed Rate Cash ISAs maturing in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC&G can trace its roots back to the Cheltenham and Gloucestershire Permanent Mutual Benefit Building and Investment Association. Its inaugural meeting, held at the Belle Vue Hotel, Cheltenham took place on 7 August 1850, and the society shortened its name to Cheltenham and Gloucestershire Benefit Building Society. The first President of the society was James Downing, of Cheltenham. Downing believed in a philosophy whereupon it was a citizen's duty to help other citizens and this was a driving force for him in helping the poor to achieve stability through home ownership. Even so, the Society was run rather shrewdly, and upon Downing's death in 1868, it had an annual income of S37,000.[4]\\r\\nAt first the Society was based in Cheltenham; its first Gloucester branch opened in 1896. Over the next 80 years, it expanded throughout[citation needed] the UK, opening its 100th branch in Pershore in 1979. During the 1980s, C&G acquired several smaller building societies, as consolidation of the sector intensified. C&G's headquarters were at Cheltenham House in central Cheltenham until their move to Barnwood in 1989.[5] The then building society had commissioned a sculpture by British artist Barbara Hepworth, \\"Theme and Variations\\",[6] which can still be seen displayed on the front of Cheltenham House.\\r\\nIn 1984 Cotswold Building Society transferred its undertakings to C&G. This was followed by the Waltham Abbey in 1985, the Colchester, the London Permanent and the Cardiff in 1987, the Essex Equitable and the Bolton in 1988, the Bury St Edmunds in 1989, the Bedford, the Guardian, the Peckham and the Walthamstow in 1990, the Portsmouth and the Bedford Crown in 1991, and the Mid-Sussex in 1992.[7]\\r\\nIn 1993 C&G merged with the Heart of England Building Society. By this point it[clarification needed] had taken over the Portsmouth, Guardian, Peckham, Walthamstow, Cardiff, Colchester, London Permanent, Bolton, Bury St Edmunds and Essex Equitable building societies.[8]\\r\\nC&G converted to a bank in 1995,[9] as result of a takeover approach from Lloyds TSB. This involved the demutualisation of the society, and generated a windfall payment to its members.\\r\\nIn 2007 C&G was restructured and closed 31 of its 195 branches, resulting in the loss of 315 jobs.[10] At the same time, the savings liabilities of Cheltenham & Gloucester plc were transferred to C&G Savings, a division of the then Lloyds TSB Bank plc. The lender for C&G mortgages also changed to Lloyds TSB Bank plc, whilst Cheltenham & Gloucester plc remained in charge of designing and administering the mortgages.\\r\\nOn 9 June 2009, it was reported that Lloyds Banking Group would close Cheltenham & Gloucester's 164 branches in November of that year, at the cost of around 1,660 jobs.[11] Lloyds stated that the C&G brand name would be retained for mortgages and savings, while customers could use any branch of Lloyds TSB to access their accounts.[12] However, on 19 August 2009, Lloyds announced that it would review this decision.[13]\\r\\nThe following societies either merged with or were acquired by C&G:[14][15]\\r\\nC&G had its own staff association, which represented members of staff in the building society for collective bargaining purposes and individual members of the staff association for disciplinary and grievance purposes. In 2004 the staff association merged with the trade union Amicus, retaining its own 'C&GSA' branding until Amicus merged with the TGWU in 2007 to form Unite.[16]\\r\\nSpeculation had arisen that Lloyds was to sell off C&G, after the European Commission demanded in late 2009 that both it and Royal Bank of Scotland sell off existing branches in order to allay competition concerns, following their respective bail-outs by the UK government.[17] Lloyds announced the creation of Project Verde in November 2009.[18]\\r\\nIn July 2012, it was announced that all of the C&G branches, along with some Lloyds TSB branches, would be sold to The Co-operative Bank and rebranded as TSB.[19][20] However in April 2013 the Co-operative Bank decided not to proceed with the acquisition, citing the economic downturn and tougher regulatory environment imposed on banks. Lloyds Banking Group confirmed that the rebranding to TSB would still take place.[21] The new TSB Bank was launched on 9 September 2013 and all Cheltenham & Gloucester branches were rebranded TSB on this date. The new bank was divested from Lloyds Banking Group in 2014 through a stock market flotation, and was acquired by Sabadell Group in July 2015.\\r\\nOn 13 June 2013 the Treasury Select Committee announced an inquiry into the required divestment of the Verde branches and the collapsed bid from The Co-operative Bank.[22] The inquiry published its final report in October 2014.[23]\\r\\nAs a result of the formation of the new TSB Bank, C&G no longer has any branches, nor does it provide new mortgages or savings products to any customers. Retained C&G mortgages are administered by Cheltenham and Gloucester plc and are provided by Lloyds Bank plc. Retained savings accounts are held with C&G Savings, a trading division of Lloyds Bank plc.[24] Following the transfer of all C&G branches to TSB Bank plc, C&G products can be serviced at Lloyds Bank branches, by phone or by post.[25] By April 2017, all remaining mortgage administration will be transferred to Lloyds Bank and rebranded[26] and the only remaining products will be legacy savings accounts, with the last remaining C&G Fixed Rate Cash ISAs maturing in 2017. If these remaining cash ISAs are also rebranded, this would bring the use of a 167-year-old brand to an end.","input":"When did lloyds take over cheltenham and gloucester?"},{"output":"Almost half (49%)","context":"Unintended pregnancies are pregnancies that are mistimed, unplanned or unwanted at the time of conception.[1] Unintended pregnancies may also result from rape, incest or various other forms of forced or unwanted sex.\\r\\nVaginal sexual activity without the use of contraception through choice or coercion is the predominant cause of unintended pregnancy. The incorrect use of a contraceptive method,[1] and failure of the method chosen also contributing. Available contraception methods include use of birth control pills, a condom, intrauterine device (IUD, IUC, IUS), contraceptive implant (implanon/nexplanon), hormonal patch, hormonal ring, cervical caps, diaphragms, spermicides, or sterilization.[2] Women choose to use a contraceptive method based on method efficacy, medical considerations, side effects, convenience, availability, friends' or family members' experience, religious views, and many other factors.[3] Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally or politically undesirable.[4]\\r\\nUnintended pregnancies may be unwanted pregnancies or mistimed pregnancies.[5] Worldwide, 38% of pregnancies (about 80 million pregnancies) were unintended in 1999.[6][7] Unintended pregnancies are the main reason for induced abortions,[5] resulting in about 42 million induced abortions;[6] not all unintended pregnancies result in abortions or unwanted children. Unintended pregnancy has been linked to numerous maternal and child health problems.[5] States that have legalized abortions and easier access to abortions have lower rates of child neglect and better living conditions for children overall. Which can be attributed to the fact that children in those states are more likely to be wanted when they are born. [8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn intended pregnancy is one that is consciously desired at the time of conception.[5] A pregnancy is intended if either partner intended or desired a pregnancy to occur, though the other partner may not want a pregnancy either at all or at that time, or he/she may be ambivalent to a pregnancy.[5]\\r\\nFeelings towards a pregnancy can change during the course of a pregnancy. For instance, a change of circumstances might lead to the continued pregnancy being unwanted and perhaps a desire to terminate an initially intended pregnancy. On the other hand, an initially unintended pregnancy might later be welcomed.\\r\\nCouples often desire to control not just the number of children, but also the timing.[9][10]\\r\\nReasons contraceptives might not have been used or been used incorrectly include:\\r\\nLive births: Unless the fetus dies in utero, the result of an unintended pregnancy is an unintended birth. According to one study, over one-third of living people in the US under 31 years of age (born since 1982) were the result of unintended pregnancies, a rate that has remained largely unchanged to date.[13][14]\\r\\nPregnancy has risks and potential complications. On average, unintended pregnancies result in poorer outcomes for the mother and for the child, if birth occurs. Unintended pregnancy usually precludes pre-conception counseling and pre-conception care, and sometimes delays initiation of prenatal care.[15] The great majority of abortions result from unintended pregnancies.\\r\\nResults of unintended pregnancy include:\\r\\nChildren whose births were unintended are:\\r\\nUnintended pregnancies lead to higher rates of maternal morbidity, and threaten the economic viability of families.[18]\\r\\nWomen with unintended pregnancies have less education and participate less in the workforce than women whose pregnancies are intended.[21]\\r\\nAbortion, the voluntary termination of pregnancy, is one of the primary consequences of unintended pregnancy.[5] A large proportion of induced abortions worldwide are due to unwanted or mistimed pregnancy.[22][23] Unintended pregnancies result in about 42 million induced abortions per year worldwide.[6] In the United States, over 92% of abortions are the result of unintended pregnancy.[21]\\r\\nAbortion carries few health risks when performed in accordance with modern medical technique.[5][24][25] It is safer for the pregnant woman than childbirth.[5][26][27] However where safe abortions are not available, abortion can contribute significantly to maternal mortality[28] and morbidity.[24]\\r\\nWhile decisions about abortion may cause some individuals psychological distress,[29] some find a reduction in distress after abortion.[5][30] There is no evidence of widespread psychological harm from abortion.[5][31][32] Unwanted pregnancy and births resulting from these pregnancies are also psychologically distressing, so considerations of psychological impact of abortion should be in comparison to potential harm from these stressors.[33][34]\\r\\nSome find abortion morally objectionable.[5] This could be due to religious beliefs, one's own personal beliefs or the context of the situation.\\r\\nUnintended pregnancies often result in an adoption of the infant, where the biological parents (or birth parents) transfer their privileges and responsibilities to the adoptive parents. There are two forms of adoptions: open adoptions and closed adoptions. Open adoption allows birth parents to know and have contact with the adoptive parents and the adopted child.[35] In a closed adoption, there is no contact between the birth parents and adoptive parents. Information identifying the adoptive parents and the birth parents is not shared. However, non-identifying information (i.e. background and medical information) about the birth parents, will be shared with the adoptive parents.[36] Birth parents choose adoption when parenting is not possible and they dont want to endure an abortion.[37] In the United States alone, 135,000 children are adopted each year[38] which represents about of all live births. According to the 2010 census, there were 1,527,020 adopted children in the United States, representing 2.5 percent of all U.S. children.[39]\\r\\nOver the six years between 1995 and 2000 there were an estimated 338 million pregnancies that were unintended and unwanted worldwide (28% of the total 1.2 billion pregnancies during that period).[40] These unwanted pregnancies resulted in nearly 700,000 maternal deaths (approximately one-fifth of maternal deaths during that period). More than one-third of the deaths were from problems associated with pregnancy or childbirth, but the majority (64%) were from complications from unsafe or unsanitary abortion.[40] Most of the deaths occurred in less developed parts of the world, where family planning and reproductive health services were less available.[40]\\r\\nIn cultures that practice honor killing, unintended pregnancy may increase the woman's chance of being killed.[citation needed]\\r\\nPrevention includes comprehensive sexual education, availability of family planning services, abstinence and increased access to a range of effective birth control methods. Most unintended pregnancies result from not using contraception, and many result from using contraceptives inconsistently or incorrectly. Though, increased rates of sexual activity are also a factor.[41]\\r\\nIncreasing use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (such as IUD and contraceptive implants) decreases the chance of unintended pregnancy by decreasing the chance of incorrect use. Method failure is relatively rare with modern, highly effective contraceptives, and is much more of an issue when such methods are unavailable or not used. (See comparison of contraceptive methods).\\r\\nIn the United States, women who have an unintended pregnancy are more likely to have subsequent unplanned pregnancies.[16] Providing family planning and contraceptive services as part of prenatal, postpartum and post abortion care can help reduce recurrence of unintended pregnancy.\\r\\nProviding contraceptives and family planning services at low or no cost to the user helps prevent unintended pregnancies. Many of those at risk of unintended pregnancy have little income, so even though contraceptives are highly cost-effective,[42] up front cost can be a barrier. Subsidized family planning services improve the health of the population and saves money for governments and health insurers by reducing medical,[15] education and other costs to society.\\r\\nProviding modern contraceptives to the 201 million women at risk of unintended pregnancy in developing countries who do not have access to contraception would cost an estimated US$3.9 billion per year.[43] This expenditure would prevent an estimated 52 million unintended pregnancies annually, preventing 1.5 million maternal and child deaths annually, and reduce induced abortions by 64% (25 million per year).[43] Reduced illness related to pregnancy would preserve 27 million healthy life years, at a cost of $144 per year of healthy life.[43]\\r\\nIt is theorized that reducing unintended pregnancies could help break the cycle of poverty.[44]\\r\\nNote: Numbers and rates are for detected pregnancies. A large proportion of pregnancies miscarry before the woman is aware of the pregnancy.\\r\\nThe global rate of unintended pregnancy was 55 per 1,000 women aged 15ÿ44 in 2008, of which 26 per 1,000 ended in abortion.[45] The rate of intended pregnancy was 79 per 1,000.[45] The estimated 208 million pregnancies in 2008 resulted in 102 million intended births, 41 million induced abortions, 33 million unintended births, and 31 million miscarriages.[45]\\r\\nGlobally, the proportion of married women practicing contraception increased from 54% in 1990 to 63% in 2003.[45] The global rate of unintended pregnancy declined from 69 per 1,000 women in 1995.[45] The decline was greatest in the more developed world.[45]\\r\\nWorldwide, 38% of pregnancies were unintended in 1999 (some 80 million unintended pregnancies in 1999).[6][7] In developed world an estimated 49% of pregnancies were unintended, 36% in the developing world.[7]\\r\\nAccording to a 2013 study approximately 16% of British pregnancies are unplanned, 29% are ambivalent, and are 55% planned.[46]\\r\\nIn France, 33% of pregnancies are unintended. Of women at risk for unintended pregnancy, only 3% do not use contraception, and 20% use intrauterine devices (IUDs).[47]\\r\\nOne study from Sweden (2008-2010) showed that the prevalence of unintended pregnancies was 23.2%[48]. One study conducted in Uppsala (2012-2013) found that 12% of pregnancies were fairly or very unplanned[49].\\r\\nAccording to a 2004 study, current pregnancies were termed \\"desired and timely\\" by 58% of respondents, while 23% described them as \\"desired, but untimely\\", and 19% said they were \\"undesired\\".[50]\\r\\nThe United States rate of unintended pregnancies is higher than the world average, and much higher than that in other industrialized nations.[51] Almost half (49%) of U.S. pregnancies are unintended, more than 3 million unintended pregnancies per year.[11][42]\\r\\nA 2011 study by the Guttmacher Institute based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other sources determined that the average U.S. rate of unintended pregnancies was 51 per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 in 2006. Most states' rates were between 40 and 65 unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women. The state with the highest rate of unintended pregnancies was Mississippi, 69 per 1,000 women, followed by California, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii and Nevada (66 to 67 per 1,000). New Hampshire had the lowest rate, 36 per 1,000 women, followed by Maine, North Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia (37 to 39 per 1,000 women).[52][53]\\r\\nOver 92% of abortions are the result of unintended pregnancy,[21] unintended pregnancies result in about 800,000 abortions/year.[6] In 2001, 44% of unintended pregnancies resulted in births, and 42% resulted in induced abortion and the rest in miscarriage.[51] It is estimated that more than half of US women have had an unintended pregnancy by age 45.[54] The U.S. states with the highest levels of abortions performed were Delaware, New York and New Jersey, with rates of 40, 38 and 31 per 1,000 women, respectively. High rates were also seen in the states of Maryland, California, Florida, Nevada and Connecticut with rates of 25 to 29 per 1,000 women. The state with the lowest abortion rate was Wyoming, which had less than 1 per 1,000 women, followed by Mississippi, Kentucky, South Dakota, Idaho and Missouri with rates of 5 to 6 abortions per 1,000 women.[55][56]\\r\\nUS birth rates declined in the 1970s. Factors that are likely to have led to this decline include: The introduction of the birth control pill in 1960, and its subsequent rapid increase in popularity; the completion of legalization of contraceptives in the 1960s and early 1970s; the introduction of federal funding for family planning in the 1960s and Title X in 1970; increased career and educational gains for women and its consequence of increased opportunity costs; and the legalization of abortion, which was completed in 1973. The decline in the birth rate was associated with reductions in the number of children put up for adoption and reduction in the rate of neonaticide.\\r\\nThe rate of unintended pregnancy declined significantly from 1987 until 1994, due to increased contraceptive use.[58][59] Since then until 2001 the rate has remained relatively unchanged.[59]\\r\\nThe proportion of births that were unintended at the time of conception decreased during the 1970s and early 1980s. Between 1982 and 1988 the proportion of births that were unintended began increasing.[5] In 1990 about 44% of births were unintended at time of conception.[5] The fraction of births that were unintended at the time of conception was even higher among lower class women (almost 60%), never-married women (73%) and unmarried teens (86%).[5]\\r\\nAmong lower-class women, the rate of unintended pregnancy and unintended birth rose from 1994 to 2001, while it declined for the more affluent women (those more than 200% of federal poverty level).[59] (Unintended pregnancy rose almost 30% and unintended births rose 50% for those below federal poverty level.) Contraceptive use had been increasing for years, but stopped in the 1990s, and began to decline among lower class women.[61] Cuts in federal and state family planning programs may account for the decreased use of contraceptives and increase in unintended pregnancies.[61]\\r\\nThe public cost of unintended pregnancy is estimated to be about 11 billion dollars per year in short-term medical costs.[21] This includes costs of births, one year of infant medical care and costs of fetal loss.[21] Preventing unintended pregnancy would save the public over 5 billion dollars per year in short-term medical costs.[21] Savings in long-term costs and in other areas would be much larger.[21] By another estimate, the direct medical costs of unintended pregnancies, not including infant medical care, was $5 billion in 2002.[62] The Brookings Institution conducted a research and their results show that taxpayers spend more than $12 billion each year on unintended pregnancies. They also find that, if all unintended pregnancies were prevented, the resulting savings on medical spending alone would equal more than three-quarters of the federal FY 2010 appropriation for the Head Start and Early Head Start programs and would be roughly equivalent to the amount that the federal government spends each year on the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF).[63]\\r\\nOf the 800,000 teen pregnancies per year,[64] over 80% were unintended in 2001.[6] One-third of teen pregnancies result in abortion.[64] In 2002, about 9% of women at risk for unintended pregnancy were teenagers,[47] but about 20% of the unintended pregnancies in the United States are to teenagers.[65] A somewhat larger proportion of unintended births are reported as mistimed, rather than unwanted, for teens compared to women in general (79% mistimed for teens vs. 69% among all women in 1998).[66]\\r\\nIn 2011, a total of 329,797 babies were born to women aged 15ÿ19 years, for a live birth rate of 31.3 per 1,000 women in this age group.1 This is a record low for U.S. teens in this age group and a drop of 8% from 2010. Birth rates fell 11% for women aged 15ÿ17 years, and 7% for women aged 18ÿ19 years. While reasons for the declines are not clear, teens seem to be less sexually active, and more of those who are sexually active seem to be using birth control than in previous years.[67]\\r\\nIn the US it is estimated that 52% of unintended pregnancies result from couples not using contraception in the month the woman got pregnant, and 43% result from inconsistent or incorrect contraceptive use; only 5% result from contraceptive failure, according to a report from the Guttmacher Institute.[6] Contraceptive use saved an estimated $19 billion in direct medical costs from unintended pregnancies in 2002.[62]\\r\\nIn 2006, publicly funded family planning services (Title X, Medicaid, and state funds) helped women avoid 1.94 million unintended pregnancies, thus preventing about 860,000 unintended births and 810,000 abortions.[68] Without publicly funded family planning services, the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the United States would be nearly two-thirds higher among women overall and among teens; the number of unintended pregnancies among lower class women would nearly double[68] The services provided at publicly funded clinics saved the federal and state governments an estimated $5.1 billion in 2008 in short term medical costs.[68] Nationally, every $1.00 invested in helping women avoid unintended pregnancy saved $3.74 in Medicaid expenditures that otherwise would have been needed.[68]\\r\\nReducing unintended pregnancy in the United States would be particularly desirable since abortion is such a politically divisive issue.[5]\\r\\nThe CDC encourages men and women to formulate a reproductive life plan, to help them in avoiding unintended pregnancies and to improve the health of women and reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes.[69]\\r\\nIn the period from 2001 to 2008, there were notable increases in the use of long-acting methods among younger women, while the pill and condom are most common, the more effective methods, such as intrauterine devices and implants, are recommended for young women and women without children.[60]\\r\\nRape is defined as sexual intercourse that is forced on a person without his or her permission. It may involve physical force, the threat of force, or it may be done against someone who is unable to give consent. Sexual intercourse may be vaginal, anal, or oral, and may involve the use of a body part or an object.[70]\\r\\nA longitudinal study in 1996 of over 4000 women in the United States followed for 3 years found that the rape-related pregnancy rate was 5.0% among victims aged 12ÿ45 years. Applying that rate to rapes committed in the United States would indicate that there are over 32,000 pregnancies in the United States as a result of rape each year.[71]\\r\\nEarly ways of preventing unwanted pregnancy included withdrawal and various alternatives to intercourse; they are difficult to use correctly and, while much better than no method, have high failure rates compared to modern methods.[9][72] Various devices and medications thought to have spermicidal, contraceptive, abortifacient or similar properties were also used.\\r\\nAbortions have been induced to prevent unwanted births since antiquity,[5] abortion methods are described in some of the earliest medical texts.[72] The degree of safety of early methods relative to the risks of child birth is unclear.[72]\\r\\nInfanticide (customary neonaticide) or abandonment (sometimes in the form of exposure) are other traditional ways of dealing with babies that were not wanted or that a family could not support.[72] Opinions on the morality or desirability of the practices have changed through history.\\r\\nWhere modern contraceptives are not available, abortion has sometimes been used as a major way of preventing birth. For instance in much of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics in the 1980s, desired family size was small, but modern contraceptive methods were not readily available, so many couples relied on abortion, which was legal, safe, and readily accessible, to regulate births.[9] In many cases, as contraceptives became more available the rate of unintended pregnancy and abortion dropped rapidly during the 1990s.[9]\\r\\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, the desired number of pregnancies has declined as reductions in infant and childhood mortality have increased the probability that children will reach adulthood. Other factors, such as level of education and economic opportunities for women, have also led to reductions in the desired number of children.[9] As the desired number of children decreases, couples spend more of their reproductive lives trying to avoid unintended pregnancies.[9]","input":"What is the proportion of unplanned pregnancies in the us?"},{"output":"6.2 to 6.9 percent","context":"Solar power in Germany consists almost exclusively of photovoltaics (PV) and accounted for an estimated 6.2 to 6.9 percent of the country's net-electricity generation in 2016.[3][4]\\r\\nAbout 1.5 million photovoltaic systems were installed around the country in 2014, ranging from small rooftop systems, to medium commercial and large utility-scale solar parks.[3]:5 Germany's largest solar farms are located in Meuro, Neuhardenberg, and Templin with capacities over 100?MW. Solar heating does not use solar energy for power generation and is therefore not included in this article.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany has been amongst the world's top PV installer for several years, with total installed capacity amounting to 41.3?gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2016,[1] behind only China.\\r\\nHowever, new installations of PV systems have declined steadily since the record year of 2011.[5] \\r\\nIt's estimated that by 2017 over 70% of the country's jobs in the solar industry have been lost in the solar sector in recent years.[1] Proponents from the PV industry blame the lack of governmental commitment, while others point out the financial burden associated with the fast paced roll-out of photovoltaics, rendering the transition to renewable energies unsustainable in their view.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany's official governmental goal is to continuously increase renewables' contribution to the country's overall electricity consumption. Long-term minimum targets are 35% by 2020, 50% by 2030 and 80% by 2050.[3]:6 \\r\\nThe country is increasingly producing more electricity at specific times with high solar irradiation than it needs, driving down spot-market prices[7] and exporting its surplus of electricity to its neighboring countries, with a record exported surplus of 34 TWh in 2014.[2] \\r\\nA decline in spot-prices may however raise the electricity prices for retail customers, as the spread of the guaranteed feed-in tariff and spot-price increases as well.[3]:17 \\r\\nAs the combined share of fluctuating wind and solar is approaching 17 percent on the national electricity mix, other issues are becoming more pressing and others more feasible. These include adapting the electrical grid, constructing new grid-storage capacity, dismantling and altering fossil and nuclear power plants ÿ brown coal and nuclear power are the country's cheapest suppliers of electricity, according to today's calculations ÿ and to construct a new generation of combined heat and power plants.[3]:7\\r\\n\\r\\nConcentrated solar power (CSP), a solar power technology that does not use photovoltaics, has virtually no significance for Germany, as this technology demands much higher solar insolation.

As the industry matures, it is reduced and becomes the same as a power purchase agreement. A feed-in tariff allows investors a guaranteed return on investment - a requirement for development. A primary difference between a tax credit and a feed-in tariff is that the cost is borne the year of installation with a tax credit, and is spread out over many years with a feed-in tariff. In both cases the incentive cost is distributed over all consumers. This means that the initial cost is very low for a feed-in tariff and very high for a tax credit. In both cases the learning curve reduces the cost of installation, but is not a large contribution to growth, as grid parity is still always reached.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the end of the boom period, national PV market has since declined significantly, due to the amendments in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) that reduced feed-in tariffs and set constraints on utility-scaled installations, limiting their size to no more than 10?kW.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current version of the EEG only guarantees financial assistance as long as the overall PV capacity has not yet reached 52 GW. It also foresees to regulate annual PV growth within a range of 2.5 GW to 3.5 GW by adjusting the guaranteed fees accordingly. The legislative reforms stipulates a 40 to 45 percent share from renewable energy sources by 2025 and a 55 to 60 percent share by 2035.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  November 2016[update], tenants in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) will soon be able to benefit from the PV panels mounted on the buildings in which they live.\\r\\nThe state government has introduced measures covering the self-consumption of power, allowing tenants to acquire the electricity generated onsite more cheaply than their regular utility contracts stipulate.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 9?GW of photovoltaic plants in Germany are being retrofitted to shut down[24] if the frequency increases to 50.2?Hz, indicating an excess of electricity on the grid. The frequency is unlikely to reach 50.2?Hz during normal operation, but can if Germany is exporting power to countries that suddenly experience a power failure. This leads to a surplus of generation in Germany, that is transferred to rotating load and generation, which causes system frequency to rise. This happened in 2003 and 2006.[25][26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, power failures could not have been caused by photovoltaics in 2006, as solar PV played a negligible role in the German energy mix at that time.[28] In December 2012, the president of Germany's \\"Bundesnetzagentur\\", the Federal Network Agency, stated that there is \\"no indication\\", that the switch to renewables is causing more power outages.[29] Amory Lovins from the Rocky Mountain Institute wrote about the German Energiewende in 2013, calling the discussion about grid stability a \\"disinformation campaign\\".[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany has about the same solar potential as Alaska, which has an average of 3.08 sun hours/day in Fairbanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of Germany's installed photovoltaic capacity, its average power output, produced electricity, and its share in the overall consumed electricity, showed a steady, exponential growth for more than two decades up to about 2012. \\r\\nSolar PV capacity doubled on average every 18 months in this period; an annual growth rate of more than 50 percent. \\r\\nSince about 2012 growth has slowed down significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany is made up of sixteen, partly sovereign federal states or L?nder. The southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Wrttemberg account for about half of the total, nationwide PV deployment and are also the wealthiest and most populous states after North Rhine-Westphalia.

New coins have been produced annually since then and they make up a valuable aspect of the Indian currency system. Today, circulating coins exist in denominations of 50 p (i.e. 50 paisa or ?0.50), ?1, ?2, ?5, and ?10. All of these are produced by four mints located across India, in Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Noida.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Indian independence, British Indian coins were in use as a frozen currency until India became a republic in 1950. The first rupee coins of the Republic of India were minted in 1950. These included 1/2 rupee, 1/4 rupee, 2 anna, 1 anna, 1/2 anna & 1 pice coins, and are referred to as the anna series or pre-decimal coinage. Under the anna series, one rupee was divided into 16 annas or 64 pice, with each anna equal to 4 pice.\\r\\nIn 1957, India shifted to the decimal system, though for a short period of time, both decimal and non-decimal coins were in circulation. To distinguish between the two pice coins in circulation, the coins minted between 1957 and 1964 were printed with the legend Naya Paisa (New Paisa). The denominations in circulation were 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 (naya) paisa and one rupee. Since rupees retained their pre-decimal value, pre-decimal coins of one, half and quarter rupees remained in circulation after decimalisation.\\r\\nThe word \\"naya\\" was dropped in 1964 and a new denomination, the 3 paisa, was introduced into circulation. A 20 paisa coin was minted in 1968. Neither of these coins gained much popularity. The 1, 2 and 3 paisa coins were phased out gradually in the 1970s. In 1982, a new 2 rupee coin was introduced experimentally to replace 2 rupee notes. The 2 rupee coin was not minted again till 1990, after which it was minted every following year.\\r\\nStainless steel coinage of 10, 25 and 50 paisa was introduced in 1988. In 1992, a new stainless steel rupee coin, smaller and lighter than the older rupee, was minted, alongside a 5 rupee Cupronickel coin.\\r\\nIn 2005, the 10 rupee coin was minted for the first time. Higher denomination coins were introduced due to an increasing demand for change and the increasing cost of printing 2, 5 and 10 rupee banknotes.\\r\\nOn 30 June 2011, all coins in denominations of 25 paisa and below were officially demonetised. Commemorative coins in circulation can be found in various denominations. They depict various special events or people, including Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, B. R. Ambedkar, Rajiv Gandhi, Dnyaneshwar, the 1982 Asian Games, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Subhas Chandra Bose, Sri Aurobindo, Chittaranjan Das, Chhatrapati Shivaji, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Bhagat Singh and Rabindranath Tagore.\\r\\nAt Independence on 15 August 1947, India was partitioned into the new British Dominions of India and Pakistan. The new Dominion (or Union) of India retained the previous imperial currency with images of British monarchs. The basic unit of currency was the Indian rupee, which was itself divided into annas (16 annas to a rupee) and pice (the old spelling of paisa - 64 pice to a rupee).[1] The lowest-denomination Indian coins, the half-pice (128 to a rupee) and the pie (192 to a rupee) were officially demonetized in 1947; while both denominations had continued to circulate up to that time, new examples were not minted after 1942 as they were practically worthless (India remained a member of the sterling area after independence and the rupee remained pegged to the pound sterling. Until 1966, the rupee was worth 1s.6d, or 18 old British pence; a half-pice was therefore worth 0.141 old pence and a pie 0.09 old pence.)[2]\\r\\nFrom 15 August 1947 until 26 January 1950, the Indian coinage structure was as follows: (bold - denominations minted)[3]\\r\\nThis represented the currency arrangements during the transition period up to the establishment of the Indian Republic.\\r\\nThe coins used after 1947 until the introduction of Republic of India - Pre decimalisation series were as follows:\\r\\nOn 26 January 1950, India became a sovereign republic. This series was introduced on 15 August 1950 and represented the first coinage of Republic India. The British King's portrait was replaced by the Lion Capital of the Ashoka Pillar. A corn sheaf replaced the Tiger on the one rupee coin. In some ways this symbolised a shift in focus to progress and prosperity. Indian motifs were incorporated on other coins. The previous monetary system and the old units of currency were retained unchanged.\\r\\nThe move towards decimalization was afoot for over a century. However, it was in September, 1955 that the Indian Coinage Act was amended for the country to adopt a metric system for coinage. The Act came into force with effect from 1 April 1957, after which anna and pice denominations were demonetised. The rupee remained unchanged in value and nomenclature. It, however, was now divided into 100 'paisa' instead of 16 annas or 64 pice. Effective from 30 June 2011, all coins in denominations of 25 paisa and below were officially demonetized.[4]\\r\\nThe antiquated spelling of \\"pice\\" was modified to \\"paisa\\" in the singular and \\"paise\\" in the plural. For public recognition, the new decimal paisa was termed 'Naya Paisa' (New Paisa) till 1 June 1964 when the term 'Naya' was dropped. The coins of 50p, 25p, 10p, 5p, 2p, and 1p had a legend in Devanagari script explaining the value of coin in terms of fraction of a rupee.\\r\\nIn June 1964, the term 'Naya' was dropped and the coins were reminted. The legend in Devanagari script explaining the value of coin in terms of fraction of a Rupee continued till it was finally dropped from the new design minted 1964 onwards.\\r\\nThe coin minted from 1965 did not have the legend in Devanagari, explaining the value of the coin as a fraction of the rupee. Small denomination coins which were made of bronze, nickel-brass, cupro-nickel, and aluminium-bronze were gradually minted in aluminium.The first coin minted in such type was the 3 Paisa coin in 1964, which was a new denomination, and continued to be minted till 1971. One and Two paisa coins were changed to Aluminium and were minted without the Devanagari legend from 1965. 20 paisa coin was introduced in 1968, which continued to be minted till 1971.\\r\\nFrom 1982, New series was launched. the 20 paisa coin which was last minted in 1971, was reintroduced again, but in Aluminium. The size and the design of 10 paisa, 50 paisa and 1 rupee was changed, though they continued to be minted in the same metal. Coins of 3p, 2p and 1p were discontinued but continued to be the legal tender.\\r\\nIn Series IV, 5 paisa and 20 paisa coins were discontinued though they continued to be minted in Series III till 1994 and 1997 respectively. 10 paisa, 25 paisa and 50 paisa coins were minted in Stainless Steel. 1992 onwards, 1 Re coin was also minted in Steel and Rs. 2 and Rs. 5 coins in Copper Nickel were introduced. The very considerable costs of managing note issues of Re 1, Rs 2, and Rs 5 led to the gradual coinage of these denominations. These coins continued to be minted till 2004, when the Unity in diversity series was launched.\\r\\nCupro-Nickel coins are not minted anymore. Ferritic Stainless Steel coins of Two and Five Rupee denominations are currently in production.[5]\\r\\nIn 2004, RBI issued a series in denominations of 1 rupee, followed by 2 rupee and 10 rupee in 2005. These issues however came into circulation in 2006, and created a controversy over their design. 10 rupee coins were the first bimetallic coins issued in India, and because of the controversy and being minted in only one mint, most of the coinage never found its way into circulation. The ones which did were hoarded by Coin collectors and Coin hoarders.\\r\\nCopper Nickel Center in\\r\\nAluminium Bronze ring\\r\\nin 2007 RBi issued a new series of Coins, The Hasta Mudra Series, in coins of denominations 50 p, 1 rupee and 2 rupee. These coins were Stainless steel coins, and displayed various Hasta Mudras, - hand gestures in Indian Classical dance. 5 rupee Stainless Steel coin with waves in its design was also issued in 2007, as well as a new 10 rupee coin with changed design in 2008. 5 rupee coin design was again reverted to the previous design, though now it was issued in Nickel-brass instead of Copper-nickel. However these 5 rupee and 10 rupee coins were not the part of the Hasta Mudra series.\\r\\nThe 5 rupee and 10 rupee coins were issued for common circulation in 2007, 2008, 2009 with changed designs and continued to be minted until the introduction of the Rupee Symbol series in 2011.\\r\\nCopper Nickel Center in Aluminium Bronze ring\\r\\nIn 2011, RBI issued a series in denominations of 50p, ?1, ?2, ?5, and ?10. The 50p, ?1, ?2, and ?5 designs are identical except the absence of the rupee symbol in 50p coin. The ?10 coin continued to be issued in bimetallic issues as previously.\\r\\nTen rupees\\r\\nCopper Nickel Center in\\r\\nAluminium Bronze ring\\r\\nFive Rupees\\r\\nTwo Rupees\\r\\nOne Rupee\\r\\nFifty paisa\\r\\nBecause of the increasing demand for coins, the Indian government was forced to mint coins in foreign countries at various points in the country's history.\\r\\nMints in Daegu, Korea, Slovakia (Kremnca), and Russia (Moscow) have also been used.\\r\\nThe first Indian commemorative coin was issued in 1964 to mourn the death of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. Since then, numerous coins of these type on almost all denomination from 5 paisa to 10 rupees have been issued. These coins based on famous personalities (usually issued on their birth or death centenary, or in rare cases on their death), government programmes and social messages.\\r\\nCommemorative coins are made at various mints across India including the ones at Mumbai, Noida, Kolkata and Hyderabad.\\r\\nThe first commemorative coins was dated 1964 and had a bust of Jawaharlal Nehru on observe and was issued in one and half rupee.\\r\\nNote: Bold Marks are Silver Coins, Mint index: K = Kolkata (no mark), H = Hyderabad (?), M = Mumbai ( or B), Noida = ().\\r\\nThe two-rupee coin issued from 2006 by the Reserve Bank, in stark contrast to the earlier coin, is rounded and simpler in design, without the map of India. The coin has already been criticized for being difficult to recognize by the visually impaired.[6] Most controversially, it features an equal-armed cross with the beams divided into two rays and with dots between adjacent beams. According to RBI, this design represents \\"four heads sharing a common body\\" under a new \\"unity in diversity\\" theme.[7] However, Hindu nationalists have charged that the symbol is a Christian cross resembling the symbol on the deniers issued by Louis the Pious.[8]\\r\\nIndia's much awaited first ever bimetallic 10 rupee coin was released in 2005 under the theme \\"Unity in Diversity\\". But, due to its controversial design resembling a cross, it was criticised and was not minted in large numbers. Another reason for its availability being scarce is that it was minted only in one (Noida) of four mints in India. Coin dealers and the public who got this coin hoarded it and it never came into circulation. It is available for sale on some auction websites, but the price of this coin is very high in comparison to its denomination due to the uncertain number of issued coins. Some coin sellers claim that this coin is a limited edition. However, official information is not yet available on the number of mintage. A press release from Reserve Bank of India mentioned that there will be two themes of 10 rupee coins: \\"Unity in Diversity\\" and \\"Connectivity and Information technology\\". From 2008 coins based on the second theme, \\"Connectivity and Information technology\\", were also released. The coin depicts 15 rays above the numeric 10. It was again minted only by the Noida mint and was not easily available in circulation. From 2011, the same theme was continued with a slight design change showing 10 rays instead of the earlier 15 and the introduction of the new Re symbol. Now it is being minted in all four mints, which are Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Noida. Apart from these definitive coins, 10 rupee bi-metallic commemorative coins have also been released as follows: 2008 ÿ Tri Centenary of Gur-ta-Gaddi 2009 ÿ Homi Bhabha Birth Centenary 2010 ÿ RBI Platinum Jubilee 2012 ÿ 60 Years of Parliament's first sitting.","input":"When was 1 rupee coin introduced in india?"},{"output":"Charles Darwin","context":"The facial feedback hypothesis states that facial movement can influence emotional experience. For example, an individual who is forced to smile during a social event will actually come to find the event more of an enjoyable experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Darwin was among the first to suggest that physiological changes caused by an emotion had a direct impact on, rather than being just the consequence of that emotion. He wrote:\\r\\nThe free expression by outward signs of an emotion intensifies it. On the other hand, the repression, as far as this is possible, of all outward signs softens our emotions... Even the simulation of an emotion tends to arouse it in our minds.[1]:366\\r\\nFollowing on this idea, William James proposed that, contrary to common belief, awareness of bodily changes activated by a stimulus \\"is the emotion\\".[2]:449 If no bodily changes are felt, there is only an intellectual thought, devoid of emotional warmth. In The Principles of Psychology, James wrote: \\"Refuse to express a passion, and it dies\\".[2]:463\\r\\nThis proved difficult to test, and little evidence was available, apart from some animal research and studies of people with severely impaired emotional functioning. The facial feedback hypothesis, \\"that skeletal muscle feedback from facial expressions plays a causal role in regulating emotional experience and behaviour\\",[3] developed almost a century after Darwin.\\r\\nWhile James included the influence of all bodily changes on the creation of an emotion, \\"including among them visceral, muscular, and cutaneous effects\\",[4]:252 modern research mainly focuses on the effects of facial muscular activity. One of the first to do so, Silvan Tomkins wrote in 1962 that \\"the face expresses affect, both to others and the self, via feedback, which is more rapid and more complex than any stimulation of which the slower moving visceral organs are capable\\".[4]:255\\r\\nTwo versions of the facial feedback hypothesis appeared, although \\"these distinctions have not always been consistent\\".[5]\\r\\nAccording to Jeffrey Browndyke,[7] \\"the strongest evidence for the facial feedback hypothesis to date comes from research by Lanzetta et al. (1976)\\" (but see \\"Studies using Botox\\" below for more recent and powerful evidence). Participants had lower skin conductance and subjective ratings of pain when hiding the painfulness of the shocks they endured, compared with those who expressed intense pain.\\r\\nHowever, in all research, difficulty remained in how to measure an effect without alerting the participant to the nature of the study and how to ensure that the connection between facial activity and corresponding emotion is not implicit in the procedure.\\r\\nOriginally, the facial feedback hypothesis studied the enhancing or suppressing effect of facial efference on emotion in the context of spontaneous, \\"real\\" emotions, using stimuli. This resulted in \\"the inability of research using spontaneous efference to separate correlation from causality\\".[4]:264 Laird (1974)[8] used a cover story (measuring muscular facial activity with electrodes) to induce particular facial muscles contraction in his participants without mentioning any emotional state. However, the higher funniness ratings of the cartoons obtained by those participants \\"tricked\\" into smiling may have been caused by their recognising the muscular contraction and its corresponding emotion: the \\"self-perception mechanism\\", which Laird (1974) thought was at the root of the facial feedback phenomenon. Perceiving physiological changes, people \\"fill the blank\\" by feeling the corresponding emotion. In the original studies, Laird had to exclude 16% (Study 1) and 19% (Study 2) of the participants as they had become aware of the physical and emotional connection during the study.\\r\\nAnother difficulty is whether the process of manipulation of the facial muscles did not cause so much exertion and fatigue that those, partially or wholly, caused the physiological changes and subsequently the emotion. Finally, the presence of physiological change may have been induced or modified by cognitive process.\\r\\nIn an attempt to provide a clear assessment of the theory that a purely physical facial change, involving only certain facial muscles, can result in an emotion, Strack, Martin, & Stepper (1988)[9] devised a cover story that would ensure the participants adopt the desired facial posing without being able to perceive either the corresponding emotion or the researchers' real motive. Told they were taking part in a study to determine the difficulty for people without the use of their hands or arms to accomplish certain tasks, participants held a pen in their mouth in one of two ways. The Lip position would contract the orbicularis oris muscle, resulting in a frown. The Teeth position would cause the zygomaticus major or the risorius muscle, resulting in a smile. The control group would hold the pen in their nondominant hand. All had to fill a questionnaire in that position and rate the difficulty involved. The last task, which was the real objective of the test, was the subjective rating of the funniness of a cartoon. The test differed from previous methods in that there were no emotional states to emulate, dissimulate or exaggerate.\\r\\nAs predicted, participants in the Teeth condition reported significantly higher amusement ratings than those in the Lips condition. The cover story and the procedure were found to be very successful at initiating the required contraction of the muscles without arising suspicion, 'cognitive interpretation of the facial action,[9] and avoiding significant demand and order effects. It has been suggested that more effort may be involved in holding a pen with the lips compared with the teeth.[5]\\r\\nTo avoid the possible effort problem, Zajonc, Murphy and Inglehart (1989) had subjects repeat different vowels, provoking smiles with \\"ah\\" sounds and frowns with \\"ooh\\" sounds for example, and again found a measurable effect of facial feedback.[5] Ritual chanting of smile vowels has been found to be more pleasant than chanting of frown vowels, which may explain their comparative prevalence in religious mantra traditions.[10]\\r\\nThese studies have resolved many of the methodological issues associated with the facial feedback hypothesis. Darwin's theory can be demonstrated, and the moderate, yet significant effect of this theory of emotions opens the door to new research on the \\"multiple and nonmutually exclusive plausible mechanisms\\"[11] of the effects of facial activity on emotions.\\r\\nDoubts about the robustness of these findings was voiced in 2016 when a replication series of the original 1988 experiment coordinated by Eric-Jan Wagenmakers and conducted in 17 labs did not find any support for the hypothesis.[12]\\r\\nBecause facial expressions involve both motor (efferent) and sensory (afferent) mechanisms, it is possible that effects attributed to facial feedback are due solely to feedback mechanisms, or feed-forward mechanisms, or some combination of both. Recently, strong experimental support for a facial feedback mechanism is provided through the use of botulinum toxin (commonly known as Botox) to temporarily paralyze facial muscles. Botox selectively blocks muscle feedback by blocking presynaptic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Thus, while motor efference commands to the facial muscles remain intact, sensory afference from extrafusal muscle fibers, and possibly intrafusal muscle fibers, is diminished.\\r\\nSeveral studies have examined the correlation of botox injections and emotion[13][14] and these suggest that the toxin could be used as a treatment for depression. Further studies have used experimental control to test the hypothesis that botox affects aspects of emotional processing. It has been suggested that the treatment of nasal muscles would reduce the ability of the person to form a disgust response which could offer a reduction of symptoms associated with obsessive compulsive disorder.[15]\\r\\nIn a functional neuroimaging study, Andreas Hennenlotter and colleagues[16] asked participants to perform a facial expression imitation task in an fMRI scanner before and two weeks after receiving botox injections in the corrugator supercilii muscle used in frowning. During imitation of angry facial expressions, botox decreased activation of brain regions implicated in emotional processing and emotional experience (namely, the amygdala and the brainstem), relative to activations before botox injection. These findings show that facial feedback modulates neural processing of emotional content, and that botox changes how the human brain responds to emotional situations.\\r\\nIn a study of cognitive processing of emotional content, David Havas and colleagues[17] asked participants to read emotional (angry, sad, happy) sentences before and two weeks after botox injections in the corrugator supercilii muscle used in frowning. Reading times for angry and sad sentences were longer after botox injection than before injection, while reading times for happy sentences were unchanged. This finding shows that facial muscle paralysis has a selective effect on processing of emotional content. It also demonstrates that cosmetic use of botox affects aspects of human cognition - namely, the understanding of language.\\r\\nA study by Mari?lle Stel, Claudia van den Heuvel, and Raymond C. Smeets[18] has shown that the facial feedback hypothesis does not hold for people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD); that is, \\"individuals with ASD do not experience feedback from activated facial expressions as controls do\\".","input":"Who came up with the facial feedback hypothesis?"},{"output":"the first human being, Adam","context":"Prophets in Islam (Arabic: ???????? ?? ?????????) include \\"messengers\\" (rasul, pl. rusul), bringers of a divine revelation via an angel (Arabic: ??????, mal?ikah);[1][2] and \\"prophets\\" (nabؐ, pl. anbiy?), lawbringers that Muslims believe were sent by God to every people, bringing God's message in a language they can understand.[1][3] Knowledge of the Islamic prophets is one of the six articles of the Islamic faith, and specifically mentioned in the Quran.[4]\\r\\nMuslims believe that the first prophet was also the first human being, Adam (???), created by Allah (????), The One and Only God who created everything in existence (?? ??????? - translit. Rabilalameen) All Humans are descendants of Adam. Many of the revelations delivered by the 48 prophets in Judaism and many prophets of Christianity are mentioned as such in the Quran but usually in slightly different forms. For example, the Jewish Elisha is called Alyasa, Job is Ayyub, Jesus is Isa, etc. The Torah given to Moses (Musa) is called Tawrat, the Psalms given to David (Dawud) is the Zabur, the Gospel given to Jesus is Injil.[1] Notwithstanding, none of the seven Jewish Prophetesses are mentioned in the Quran as prophets.\\r\\nUnique to Islam is Muhammad (Muhammad ibn ?Abdullh), who Muslims believe is the \\"Seal of the Prophets\\" (Khatam an-Nabiyyin, i.e. the last prophet); and the Quran, revealed to Muhammad that he himself did not write down,[5] which Muslims believe is unique among divine revelations as the only correct one protected by God from distortion or corruption,[6] destined to remain in its true form until the Last Day.[7] Muslims belief Muhammad (with exception of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community) to be the last prophet, althought after the prophets there will still be saints.[8]\\r\\nIn Muslim belief, every prophet in Islam preached the same main Islamic beliefs, the Oneness of God, worshipping of that one God, avoidance of idolatry and sin, and the belief in the Islamic Day of Resurrection or the Day of Judgement and life after death. Each came to preach Islam at different times in history and some told of the coming of the final Islamic prophet and messenger of God, who would be named \\"Ahmed\\" commonly known as Muhammad. Each Islamic prophet directed a message to a different group of people, and thus would preach Islam in accordance with the times.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Arabic and Hebrew,[9] the term nabؐ (Arabic plural form:anbiy?) means \\"prophet\\". Forms of this noun occur 75 times in the Quran. The term nubuwwah (meaning \\"prophethood\\") occurs five times in the Quran. The terms rasl (plural: rusul) and mursal (plural: mursaln) denote \\"messenger\\" or \\"apostle\\" and occur more than 300 times. The term for a prophetic \\"message\\", rislah (plural: rislt), appears in the Quran in ten instances.[10]\\r\\nThe Syriac form of rasl Allh (literally: \\"messenger of God\\"), s?h?eli?eh d-allh, occurs frequently in the apocryphal Acts of St. Thomas. The corresponding verb for s?h?eli?ehs?h?ala?, occurs in connection with the prophets in the Hebrew Bible.[11][12][13][14]\\r\\nThe words \\"prophet\\" (Arabic: ??? nabؐ) and \\"messenger\\" (Arabic: ???? rasl) appear several times in the Old Testament and the New Testament.\\r\\nThe following table shows these words in different languages:[15]\\r\\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the word navi (\\"spokesperson, prophet\\") occurs more commonly, and the Hebrew word mal'akh (\\"messenger\\") refers to Angels in Judaism. According to Judaism, Haggai, Zachariah, and Malachi were the last prophets, all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year Babylonian exile. With them, the authentic period of Nevuah (\\"prophecy\\") died,[16] and nowadays only the \\"Bath Kol\\" (?? ???, lit. daughter of a voice, \\"voice of God\\") exists (Sanhedrin 11a).\\r\\nIn the New Testament, however, the word \\"messenger\\" becomes more frequent, sometimes in association with the concept of a prophet.[17] \\"Messenger\\" may refer to Jesus, to his Apostles and to John the Baptist. But the last book of the Old Testament, the Book of Malachi, speaks of a messenger that Christian commentators interpret as a reference to the future prophet John the Baptist (Yahya).[18]\\r\\nIn Muslim belief, every Islamic prophet preached Islam. The beliefs of charity, prayer, pilgrimage, worship of God and fasting are believed to have been taught by every prophet who has ever lived.[19] The Quran itself calls Islam the \\"religion of Abraham\\" (Ibrahim)[20] and refers to Jacob (Yaqub) and the Twelve Tribes of Israel as being Muslim.[21]\\r\\nThe Quran says\\r\\nThe same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noahthe which We have sent by inspiration to theeand that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein:...\\r\\nThe Quran speaks of the Islamic prophets as being the greatest human beings of all time.[19] A prophet, in the Muslim sense of the term, is a person whom God specially chose to teach the faith of Islam.[19] Before man was created, God had specifically selected those men whom He would use as prophets. This does not, however, mean that every prophet began to prophesy from his birth. Some were called to prophesy late in life, in Muhammad's case at the age of 40.[23] Others, such as John the Baptist, were called to prophesy while still at a young age and Jesus prophesied while still in his cradle.[24]\\r\\nThe Quran verse 4:69 lists various virtuous groups of human beings, among whom prophets (including messengers) occupy the highest rank. Verse 4:69 reads:[10]\\r\\nAll who obey Allah and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of Allahof the prophets (who teach), the sincere (lovers of Truth), the witnesses (who testify), and the Righteous (who do good): Ah! what a beautiful fellowship!\\r\\nBiblical stories retold in the Quran in the Arabic language (e.g., Job, Moses, Joseph (Yusuf) etc.) certainly differ from the Jewish Hebrew Bible, the Greek Old Testament and the Greek New Testament, in that the Quran always demonstrates that it is \\"God's practice\\" (sunnat Allah) to make faith triumph finally over the forces of evil and adversity. \\"We have made the evil ones friends to those without faith.\\"[26] \\"Assuredly God will defend those who believe.\\"[27][28] Thus the Islamic Isa did not die on the cross like the Christian Jesus, but deceived his enemies and ascended to heaven.\\r\\nAccording to orthodox Sunni doctrine, prophets are unlike other human beings (including \\"the companions\\" of the Prophet, the members of Muhammad's family, and Sufi saints) in that they are \\"protected from major and minor wrongdoing\\" (Ma'soom). However, they also \\"share no divine attributes\\", and possess \\"no knowledge or power\\" other than that granted to them by God.[29]\\r\\nMuslims believe that many prophets existed, including many not mentioned in the Quran. The Quran itself refers to at least four other prophets but does not name them.[30][31] One less-than-sound hadith states there have been 124,000 prophets,[32][33] while another scholarly source states that \\"their exact numbers are not known with any kind of certainty.\\"[29]\\r\\nMost mainstream Sunni scholars agree that prophets were males only.[34] Still, some like Ibn Hazm, Qartubi, Ibn Hajir, and al Ashari thought that the verses that mention angels speaking to Mary are proofs of her prophet hood.[35][36] Also, Ibn Hajir interprets the Hadith \\"Many among men attained perfection but among women none attained the perfection except Mary, the daughter of \`Imran and Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh.\\" He said perfection is prophet hood in turn his claim that Mary and Asiya were prophets.[37]\\r\\nThe revealed books are the records which Muslims believe were dictated by God to various Islamic prophets throughout the history of mankind. All these books promulgated the code and laws of Islam. The belief in all the revealed books is an article of faith in Islam and Muslims must believe in all the scriptures to be a Muslim. Muslims believe the Quran, the final holy scripture, was sent because all the previous holy books had been either corrupted or lost.[38] Nonetheless, Islam speaks of respecting all the previous scriptures, even in their current forms.[39]\\r\\nThe Quran mentions some Islamic scriptures by name, which came before the Quran:\\r\\nThe Quran mentions various divinely-bestowed gifts given to various prophets. These may be interpreted as books or forms of celestial knowledge. Although all prophets are believed by Muslims to have been immensely gifted, special mention of \\"wisdom\\" or \\"knowledge\\" for a particular prophet is understood to mean that some secret knowledge was revealed to him. The Quran mentions that Abraham prayed for wisdom and later received it.[53] It also mentions that Joseph[54] and Moses[55] both attained wisdom when they reached full age; David received wisdom with kingship, after slaying Goliath;[56] Lot (Lut received wisdom whilst prophesying in Sodom and Gomorrah;[57] John the Baptist received wisdom while still a mere youth;[58] and Jesus received wisdom and was vouchsafed the Gospel.[59]\\r\\nAll messengers mentioned in the Quran are also prophets, but not all prophets are messengers.[60]\\r\\nTo believe in God's messengers (Rusul) means to be convinced that God sent men as guides to fellow human beings and jinn (khalq) to guide them to the truth.\\r\\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community does not believe that messengers and prophets are different individuals. They interpret the Quranic words warner (nadhir), prophet, and messenger as referring to different roles that the same divinely appointed individuals perform. Ahmadiyya distinguish only between law-bearing prophets and non-law-bearing ones. They believe that although law-bearing prophethood ended with Muhammad, non-law-bearing prophethood subordinate to Muhammad continues. The Ahmadiyya Community recognizes Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835ÿ1908) as such a prophet of God and the promised Messiah and Imam Mahdi of the latter days.[105]\\r\\nThe Quran mentions 25 prophets by name but also tells that God sent many other prophets and messengers, to all the different nations that have existed on Earth. Many verses in the Quran discuss this:\\r\\nNumerous other prophets have been mentioned by scholars in the Hadith, exegesis, commentary as well as in the famous collections of Qisas Al-Anbiya (Stories of the Prophets).

They are also occasionally seen within the sagittal and coronal sutures. A large wormian bone at lambda is often called an Inca bone (Os Incae),[3] due to the relatively high frequency of occurrence in Peruvian mummies. Another specific wormian bone, the pterion ossicle, sometimes exists between the sphenoidal angle of the parietal bone and the great wing of the sphenoid bone.[4] They tend to vary in size and can be found on either side of the skull.

The Rangers experienced early success, winning the Stanley Cup in only their second season of existence, and would go on to win two more in the next 12 years.\\r\\nAfter their Cup win in 1940, the Rangers then suffered through one of the longest championship droughts in NHL history, which became known as the Curse of 1940. The 54-year drought ended with a Cup win in 1994 by a team led by captain Mark Messier, Brian Leetch, Adam Graves, and Mike Richter, all of whose numbers have since been retired by the team.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1925, the New York Americans joined the National Hockey League, playing in Madison Square Garden. The Amerks proved to be a greater success than expected, leading Garden president Tex Rickard to seek his own franchise for the Garden, despite promising the Amerks that they would be the only hockey team to play there.\\r\\nRickard was granted a franchise, which he originally planned to name the \\"New York Giants\\".[citation needed] By the time the franchise was granted in April 1926, the name \\"New York Rangers Professional Hockey Club\\" was the official name.[1] The origin of the name Rangers, as in \\"Tex's Rangers\\" is variously attributed to Rickard himself or the New York press.[2][3] Rickard managed to get future legendary Toronto Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe to assemble the team.\\r\\nAt the time, there was no expansion draft in the NHL to help new teams ice competitive rosters, which in any other year would have made assembling a playoff contender extremely difficult. However, 1926 also happened to be the year the NHL's last major rival of its early era (the Western Hockey League) went out of business, so there was an abundance of top-caliber hockey talent searching for new clubs. The owners of the Rangers' expansion cousins (the Detroit Cougars and Chicago Black Hawks) opted to purchase entire WHL rosters (the Victoria Cougars and Portland Rosebuds respectively) to stock their teams. Smythe eschewed this approach, opting instead to sign who he felt were the best players from the remaining four WHL teams as well as a few NHL castaways he felt the other teams had misjudged.\\r\\nSmythe had a falling-out with Rickard's hockey man, Col. John S. Hammond, and was fired as manager-coach on the eve of the first season  he was paid a then-hefty $10,000 to leave.[4] Smythe was replaced by Pacific Coast Hockey Association co-founder Lester Patrick, who kept all of the players Smythe had assembled. Smythe's approach to building the team paid quick dividends, as Rangers turned out to be a winner. The Rangers won the American Division title their first year but lost to the Boston Bruins in the playoffs. The team's early success led to players becoming minor celebrities and fixtures in New York City's Roaring Twenties nightlife. It was also during this time, playing at the Garden on 48th Street, blocks away from Times Square, that the Rangers obtained their now-famous nickname \\"The Broadway Blueshirts\\".\\r\\nIn only their second season, the Rangers won the Stanley Cup, defeating the Montreal Maroons three games to two. One of the most memorable stories that emerged from the Finals involved Patrick playing in goal at the age of 44. At the time, teams were not required to dress a backup goaltender so when the Rangers' regular goaltender, Lorne Chabot, left a game with an eye injury, Maroons head coach Eddie Gerard vetoed his original choice for a replacement (who was Alex Connell, another NHL goalie of the old Ottawa Senators who was in attendance for the game). An angry Patrick lined up between the pipes for two periods in game two of the Stanley Cup Finals, allowing one goal to Maroons center Nels Stewart. Frank Boucher would score the game-winning goal in overtime for New York. An expansion team would not come this far this fast in North American professional sports until the Philadelphia Atoms won the North American Soccer League title in their first year of existence.\\r\\nAfter a loss to the Bruins in the 1928ÿ29 finals and a few mediocre seasons in the early 1930s, the Rangers, led by brothers Bill and Bun Cook on the right and left wings, respectively, and Frank Boucher at center, would defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1932ÿ33 best-of-five finals, three games to one, to win their second Stanley Cup, exacting revenge on the Leafs' \\"Kid line\\" of Busher Jackson, Joe Primeau, and Charlie Conacher. The Rangers would spend the rest of the 1930s playing close to .500 hockey until their next Cup win. Lester Patrick stepped down as head coach and was replaced by Frank Boucher.\\r\\nIn 1939ÿ40, the Rangers finished the regular season in second place behind the Boston Bruins. The two teams would meet in the first round of the playoffs. The Bruins gained a two-games-to-one series lead from the Rangers until they recovered to win three straight games, defeating the first-place Bruins four games to two. The Rangers' first-round victory gave them a bye until the finals. The Detroit Red Wings disposed of the New York Americans in their first round best-of-three series two games to one (even as the Americans had analytical and notorious ex-Bruins star Eddie Shore) and the Toronto Maple Leafs ousted the Chicago Black Hawks two games to none. The Maple Leafs and Red Wings would play a best-of-three series to determine who would go on to play the Rangers in the Cup Finals. The Maple Leafs swept the Red Wings and the Finals match-up was determined. The 1940 Stanley Cup Finals started in Madison Square Garden in New York. The first two games went to the Rangers. In game one the Rangers needed overtime to gain a 1ÿ0 series lead, but they won game two more easily with a 6ÿ2 victory. The series then headed to Toronto where the Maple Leafs won the next two games, tying the series 2ÿ2. In games five and six, the Rangers won in overtime, taking the series four games to two to earn their third Stanley Cup.\\r\\nThe Rangers would collapse by the mid-1940s, losing games by as much as 15ÿ0 and having one goaltender with a 6.20 goals-against average. They would miss the playoffs for five consecutive seasons before squeaking into the fourth and final playoff spot in 1948. They lost in the first round and would miss the playoffs again in 1949. In the 1950 finals, the Rangers were forced to play all of their games on the road (home games in Toronto) while the circus was at the Garden. They would end up losing to the Detroit Red Wings in overtime in the seventh game of the finals, despite a stellar first-round performance as underdogs to the Montreal Canadiens.\\r\\nDuring this time, Red Wings owner James E. Norris became the largest stockholder in the Garden. However, he did not buy controlling interest in the arena, which would have violated the NHL's rule against one person owning more than one team. Nonetheless, he had enough support on the board to exercise de facto control.\\r\\nThe Rangers missed the playoffs in 12 of the next 16 seasons. However, the team was rejuvenated in the late 1960s, symbolized by moving into a newly-rebuilt Madison Square Garden in 1968. A year earlier, they had made the playoffs for the first time in five years on the strength of rookie goaltender Eddie Giacomin and acquired 1950s Montreal Canadiens star right wing Bernie \\"Boom Boom\\" Geoffrion.\\r\\nThe Rangers made the Finals twice in the 1970s, but lost both times to two 1970s powerhouses; in six games to the Boston Bruins in 1972, who were led by such stars as Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito, Ken Hodge, Johnny Bucyk, and Wayne Cashman; and in five games to the Canadiens in 1979, who had Bob Gainey, Guy Lafleur, Larry Robinson, Ken Dryden, Guy Lapointe, and Serge Savard. This time the Rangers had Esposito, but it didn't matter, as the Canadiens were dominant.\\r\\nBy 1972, the Rangers reached the Stanley Cup Finals despite losing high-scoring center Jean Ratelle (who had been on pace over Bruin Phil Esposito to become the first Ranger since Bryan Hextall in 1942 to lead the NHL in scoring) to injury during the stretch drive of the regular season. The strength of players like Brad Park, Ratelle, Vic Hadfield, and Rod Gilbert (the last three constructing the famed \\"GAG line\\", meaning \\"goal-a-game\\") would still carry them through the playoffs. They would defeat the defending-champion Canadiens in the first round and the Chicago Blackhawks in the second, but lost to the Bruins in the finals.\\r\\nThe Rangers played a legendary semifinal series against the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1973ÿ74 playoffs. This series was noted for a game seven fight between Dale Rolfe of the Rangers and Dave Schultz of the Flyers. Schultz pummeled Rolfe without anyone on the Rangers lifting a finger to protect him (the GAG line was on the ice at the time). This led to the belief that the Rangers of that period were soft, especially when taking into account the bullying endured by the Rangers during the 1972 finals. One example is Gilbert's beating at the hands of Derek Sanderson of the Bruins.\\r\\nTheir new rivals, the New York Islanders, who entered the league in 1972 after paying a huge territorial fee  some $4 million  to the Rangers, were their first-round opponent in 1975. After splitting the first two games, the Islanders defeated the more-established Rangers eleven seconds into overtime of the deciding game three, establishing a rivalry that continued to grow for years.\\r\\nAfter some off years in the mid-to-late 1970s, they picked up Esposito and Carol Vadnais from the Bruins for Park, Ratelle, and Joe Zanussi in 1975. Swedish stars Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson jumped to the Rangers from the maverick World Hockey Association. And in 1979 they defeated the surging Islanders in the semi-finals and would return to the finals again before bowing out to the Canadiens. The Islanders got their revenge, however, eliminating the Rangers in four consecutive playoff series starting in 1981 en route to their second of four consecutive Stanley Cup titles.\\r\\nThe Rangers stayed competitive through the 1980s and early 1990s, making the playoffs each year except for one but never going very far. An exception was 1985ÿ86, when the Rangers, behind rookie goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck, upended the Patrick Division-winning Flyers in five games followed by a six-game win over the Washington Capitals in the Patrick Division Finals. Montreal disposed of the Rangers in the Wales Conference Finals behind a rookie goaltender of their own, Patrick Roy. The Rangers then acquired superstar center Marcel Dionne after almost 12 years as a Los Angeles King the next year. In 1988, Dionne moved into third place in career goals scored (since bettered by Brett Hull). But Dionne's always-churning legs started to slow the next year, thereby ensuring that his goals came further and further apart. \\"Because you love the game so much, you think it will never end\\", said Dionne, who spent nine games in the minors before retiring in 1989. He would only play 49 playoff games in 17 seasons with the Rangers, Kings, and Detroit Red Wings.\\r\\nThe many playoff failures convinced Rangers fans that this was a manifestation of the Curse of 1940, which is said to either have begun when the Rangers management burnt the mortgage to Madison Square Garden in the bowl of the Stanley Cup after the 1940 victory or by Red Dutton following the collapse of the New York Americans franchise. In the early 1980s, Islander fans began chanting \\"1940! 1940!\\" to taunt the Rangers. Fans in other cities soon picked up the chant.\\r\\nFrustration was at its peak when the 1991ÿ92 squad captured the Presidents' Trophy. They took a 2-1 series lead on the defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins and then faltered in three straight (most observers note a Ron Francis slapshot from the blue line that eluded Mike Richter as the series' turning point). The following year, injuries and a 1-11 finish landed the Rangers in the cellar of the Patrick Division after being in a playoff position for much of the season. Coach Roger Neilson did not finish the season. The off-season hiring of controversial head coach Mike Keenan was criticized by many who pointed out Keenan's 0ÿ3 record in the finals.\\r\\nDuring this period, the Rangers were owned by Gulf+Western, which was renamed to Paramount Communications in 1989, and sold to Viacom in 1994. Viacom then sold the team to ITT Corporation and Cablevision, and a couple of years later, ITT sold their ownership stake to Cablevision, who still owns the team today\\r\\nThe 1993ÿ94 season was a successful one for Rangers fans, as Mike Keenan led the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup championship in 54 years.[5] Two years prior, they picked up center Mark Messier (now with the Rangers as special assistant to president and general manager), who was a part of the Edmonton Oilers' Cup-winning teams. Adam Graves, who also came from the Oilers, joined the Rangers as well. Other ex-Oilers on the Rangers included Esa Tikkanen and trade deadline acquisitions Oilers Captain Craig MacTavish and Glenn Anderson from the Toronto Maple Leafs. Graves would set a team record with 52 goals, breaking the old record of 50 held by Vic Hadfield. This record would later be broken by Jaromr Jgr on April 8, 2006, against the Boston Bruins.[6]\\r\\nThe Rangers clinched the Presidents' Trophy by finishing with the best record in the NHL at 52ÿ24ÿ8, setting a franchise record with 112 points. Their winning of the inaugural Atlantic Division title was only one of three times that the division title wasn't won by two of their biggest rivals, the New Jersey Devils and the Philadelphia Flyers.\\r\\nThe Rangers successfully made it past the first two rounds of the playoffs, sweeping the New York Islanders, who were seeded eighth in the first round, and then breezed by the Washington Capitals, seeded seventh, in five. However, things got interesting in the Conference Finals against the third-seeded Devils. The Rangers lost the series opener at home in double overtime, but won the next two games before the Devils beat the New York offense and defeated them 3-1 and 4-1. The series headed back to the Meadowlands for the next game, but the day before that sixth game, Rangers' captain Mark Messier stepped up and guaranteed a win. Keenan said of the guarantee:\\r\\nIn that sixth game, Messier rose to the occasion and scored three times in the final period to lead the Rangers to a 4-2 win and set up a seventh game back at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers won game seven 2-1, when Stphane Matteau scored a goal in double overtime, leading the team to the finals for the first time since 1979.\\r\\nUp against the Vancouver Canucks, the Cinderella team from the west, the Rangers again lost the series opener at home in overtime. Brian Leetch hit the crossbar at one end, and the Canucks going down to score the winner at the other on a shot from Greg Adams. The Rangers then bounced back and they won the next three games, allowing the Canucks just four goals. That set the stage for a game-five Stanley Cup celebration at home, the first time the team had ever been in a position to win a Cup at the Garden.\\r\\nThat night, the Canucks were leading 3-0 by the third minute of the third period. Even though the Rangers pulled even by the midway point, Vancouver took the lead 29 seconds later and cruised to a 6-3 win. New York's parade hopes were given another jolt two nights later when the Canucks put together a 4-1 win. Keenan said of playing game seven:\\r\\nEntering Game 7, Keenan became the first person to be a head coach in game sevens of the Stanley Cup Finals for two different teams. Keenan had coached the Flyers in 1987 when they lost to the Oilers.[8][9] Mike Babcock would join him in this feat in 2009 while with the Detroit Red Wings, having been with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim when they lost to the Devils in 2003 (the home team won all seven games of the series).[10]\\r\\nThe seventh game was a classic.[8] The Rangers took a 2-0 first period lead on goals by Leetch and Graves, but Vancouver captain Trevor Linden scored short-handed to cut the lead. Messier scored later on a power play to put the Rangers up 3-1. Linden scored a power play goal early in the third, but the Rangers managed to hang on, 3-2, as the Garden erupted in cheers and tears. Mark Messier provided two of the most memorable images of that Stanley Cup Finals that would become iconic images to the Rangers and their fans and in all of hockey: first, jumping up and down like a little kid with overwhelming emotion as ticker tape fell, then, showing incredible emotion as he accepted the Stanley Cup from NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman,[11] as he became the first (and to this date, the only) player to captain two teams to the Stanley Cup, having been with the Oilers in 1990. This image was taken by George Kalinsky, photographer at Madison Square Garden,[12] and were captured on film.\\r\\nLeetch became the first American-born player to win the Conn Smythe Trophy, the first non-Canadian to win it, and Keenan avoided being the first coach to lose Game 7 Stanley Cup Finals with two teams. However, this unfortunate fate would befall Babcock in 2009 when the Red Wings lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins, in-state rivals of the Flyers.[10]\\r\\nThe Rangers winning this Stanley Cup was the highest-rated single CBC Sports program in history to that point (Now that distinction belongs to the men's ice hockey gold medal game between Canada and the United States at the 2002 Winter Olympics, when Canada won its first Olympic ice hockey gold medal since the 1952 Winter Olympics).[13] CBC commentator Bob Cole said that Game 7 was one of his most memorable TV games.[14]\\r\\nDespite having coached the Rangers to a regular season first-place finish and the Stanley Cup, head coach Mike Keenan left after a dispute with General Manager Neil Smith. During the 1994ÿ95 lockout-shortened season, the Rangers struggled to find their form and lost in the second round of the playoffs. They snuck in with the 8th seed and defeated Quebec in the first round, but were swept by Philadelphia in the 2nd round. Succeeding Rangers coach Colin Campbell orchestrated a deal that sent Sergei Zubov and center Petr Nedved to Pittsburgh in exchange for defenceman Ulf Samuelsson and left winger Luc Robitaille in the summer of 1995. The Rangers landed an aging Wayne Gretzky in 1996, but even with The Great One, they would fizzle out. Their 1994 stars were aging and many retired or dropped off in performance. Gretzky's greatest accomplishment was leading them to the 1997 Eastern Conference finals, where they lost 4ÿ1 to the Eric Lindros-led Philadelphia Flyers. After General Manager Neil Smith ran Messier, a former Oiler teammate of Gretzky's, out of town in the summer of 1997 and failed in a bid to replace him with Colorado Avalanche superstar Joe Sakic,[15] the Rangers began a streak of seven seasons without making the playoffs, despite routinely having the highest payroll in the league.\\r\\nIn March 2000, Smith was fired along with head coach John Muckler, and, that summer, James Dolan hired Glen Sather to replace him.[16] By the end of the 2000ÿ01 season, the Rangers had landed a lot of star power. Mark Messier had returned to New York, Theoren Fleury joined the Rangers after spending most of his career with the Calgary Flames,[17] and Eric Lindros was traded to the Rangers from the Philadelphia Flyers.[18] The Rangers also acquired Pavel Bure late in the 2001ÿ02 season from the Florida Panthers.[19] It was the rookie season of goalie Dan Blackburn, who made the NHL All-Rookie Team even as the Rangers fell back to last place in the conference.[20] Despite these high-priced acquisitions the Rangers still finished out of the playoffs. Later years saw other stars such as Alexei Kovalev, Jaromir Jagr, Martin Rucinsky and Bobby Holik added, but in 2002ÿ03 and 2003ÿ04, the team again missed the playoffs. Blackburn started strongly in 2002ÿ03, but burned out after 17 games. He missed 2003ÿ04 due to mononucleosis and a damaged nerve in his left shoulder. Blackburn could not rehabilitate the damaged nerve, and was forced to retire at age 22.[21]\\r\\nTowards the end of the 2003ÿ04 season, General Manager Glen Sather finally gave in to a rebuilding process by trading away Brian Leetch, Alexei Kovalev,and eight others for numerous prospects and draft picks. With the retirements of Pavel Bure and Mark Messier, as well as Eric Lindros signing with the Toronto Maple Leafs, the post-lockout Rangers, under new head coach Tom Renney, moved away from high-priced veterans towards a group of talented young players, such as Petr Prucha, Dominic Moore and Blair Betts. However, the focus of the team remained on veteran superstar Jaromir Jagr. The Rangers were expected to struggle during the 2005ÿ06 season for their eighth consecutive season out of the post-season. For example, Sports Illustrated declared them the worst team in the League in their season preview,[22] but behind stellar performances by Swedish rookie goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, Martin Straka, Michael Nylander, Prucha and Jagr, the Rangers finished the season a record of 44ÿ26ÿ12, their best record since 1993ÿ94.\\r\\nJagr broke the Rangers' single-season points record with a first-period assist in a 5ÿ1 win against the New York Islanders on March 29, 2006.[23] The assist gave him 110 points on the season, breaking Jean Ratelle's record.[24] Less than two weeks later, on April 8, Jagr scored his 53rd goal of the season against the Boston Bruins, breaking the club record previously held by Adam Graves.[25] Two games prior, on April 4, the Rangers defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 3ÿ2, in a shootout, to clinch a playoff spot for the first time since the 1996ÿ97 season.[26] On April 18, the Rangers lost to the Ottawa Senators 5ÿ1, and, due to wins by Division rivals New Jersey and Philadelphia, the Rangers fell back to third place in the Atlantic and sixth in the Eastern Conference to end the season.[27] In the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, the Rangers drew a matchup with the Devils and were defeated in a four-game sweep. In the process, they were outscored 17ÿ4, as New Jersey goaltender Martin Brodeur took two shutouts and a 1.00 GAA to Lundqvist's 4.25. In the first game of the series, Jagr suffered an undisclosed injury to his left shoulder, diminishing his usefulness as the series progressed. He missed Game 2 of the series and was back in the lineup for Game 3, though he was held to just one shot on goal. On his first shift of Game 4, however, Jagr re-injured his shoulder and was unable to return for the remainder of the game. Jagr fell two points short of winning his sixth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion in 2005ÿ06 (the San Jose Sharks' Joe Thornton claimed the award, his first, with 125 points), but Jagr did win his third Pearson Award as the players' choice for the most outstanding player.\\r\\nWith the Rangers doing so well in 2005ÿ06, expectations were raised for the 2006ÿ07 season, evidenced by Sports Illustrated then predicting the Rangers would finish first in their division.[28] Realizing that the team had trouble scoring goals in the 2005ÿ06 campaign, the Rangers went out and signed Triple Gold Club winner, 12-time 30-goal scorer, and long-time Detroit Red Wing Brendan Shanahan to a one-year contract. However, the organization remained committed to its rebuilding program despite the signing of the 37-year-old left winger.[29]\\r\\nOn October 5, 2006, opening night of the 2006ÿ07 season, Jagr was named the first team captain since Mark Messier's retirement.[30]Though the Rangers started a bit slow in the first half of the 2006ÿ07 season, the second half was dominated by the stellar goaltending of Henrik Lundqvist. On February 5, 2007 the Rangers acquired agitating forward Sean Avery in a trade with the Los Angeles Kings. The acquisition of Sean Avery brought new life and intensity to the team. Despite losing several players to injury in March, the Rangers went 10-2-3 in the month of March to move into playoff position, and on April 5th clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive season with a 3-1 win over the Montreal Canadiens. The Rangers finished the season ahead of the Tampa Bay Lightning and the New York Islanders, finishing in third place in the Atlantic Division and sixth place in the Eastern Conference for the second straight year. Facing the Atlanta Thrashers in the first round of the playoffs, the Rangers swept the series thanks to play from all around the ice. However, the Rangers lost the next round to the Buffalo Sabres by four games to two.\\r\\nAt the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, the Rangers chose Alexei Cherepanov 17th overall. Cherepanov had been ranked by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau as the number one European skater and was considered to be a top five pick leading up to the draft, but fell due to teams being unsure whether he would ever come to the NHL from Russia.[31] Despite the departure of Michael Nylander in free agency, the 2007 free agency season started with a bang for the Rangers, with the signing of two high-profile centerman, Scott Gomez from New Jersey on a seven-year, $51.5 million contract, as well as Chris Drury from Buffalo on a five-year, $32.25 million deal.[32] The moves, along with retaining most other key players, had been met favorably, as the Rangers appeared to be strong Stanley Cup contenders,[33] making the playoffs for the third consecutive season and the second round for the second season in a row. Despite these streaks, however, the Rangers failed to meet expectations, losing their second round series four games to one to the Pittsburgh Penguins. The following offseason saw the departures of captain Jaromir Jagr to the KHL, and alternate captains Martin Straka and Brendan Shanahan, who returned to play in the Czech Republic and with the New Jersey Devils, respectively. Following these departures, Chris Drury was named captain on October 3, 2008.\\r\\nThe Rangers were one of four NHL teams to open their 2008ÿ09 season in Europe, being featured in the Victoria Cup final, defeating the European Champions Cup winner Metallurg Magnitogorsk in Bern, Switzerland. The Rangers followed by playing two NHL regular-season games against Tampa Bay in Prague on October 4 and 5, winning both games by 2ÿ1 scorelines. The Rangers tied the 1983ÿ84 Rangers for the best start in franchise history with a 5ÿ0 record, and set the franchise record for best start in a season through the first 13 games by going 10ÿ2ÿ1 for 21 points, with the 10 wins and 21 points each becoming franchise records. A successful start to the season, however, was tempered with by the news of the sudden death of 2007 first-round pick Alexei Cherepanov, which occurred during a KHL game in Russia on October 13, 2008.[34] A disappointing second half of the season followed. After the Rangers went 2-7-3 in their previous 12 games, on February 23, 2009 coach Tom Renney was fired, with 2004 Stanley Cup and Jack Adams Award winner John Tortorella named as his replacement.[35] The Rangers made the 2009 playoffs, but lost their opening round series to the Washington Capitals four games to three after winning the first two games in Washington and having a 3ÿ1 series lead after Game 4. On June 30, 2009 the Rangers traded Scott Gomez, Tom Pyatt, and Michael Busto to the Montreal Canadiens for Chris Higgins, Ryan McDonagh, Pavel Valentenko, and Doug Janik. With Gomez's contract and salary cap hit gone, the Rangers then signed superstar Marian Gaborik on July 1, the first day of free agency.\\r\\nIn the 2009ÿ10 season, the Rangers failed to make the playoffs for the first time in five years. There was some criticism that the off-season acquisition of Gaborik, among other top-tier players, had not paid off. However, Gaborik scored 42 goals and 86 points in the season, an impressive return for the team. Despite of a strong 8ÿ2 start to the season, the Rangers appeared to play inconsistently with numerous losing streaks. By March 2010, the Rangers were in danger of falling out of the 2010 playoff race entirely, but they registered a respectable 7ÿ1ÿ2 record to finish the season. The final two games of the season were a home-and-home against the Philadelphia Flyers. The first was April 9, 2010, in New York, and the Rangers skated away with the victory, keeping their post-season hopes alive. The final game of the season would become the deciding game to determine who would make the playoffs. The Flyers peppered the Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist with 47 shots, but scored only once. The game went to a shootout, and the Flyers prevailed to move on to the playoffs despite the strong overall finish to the season by the Rangers.\\r\\nFor the 2010ÿ11 season, the Rangers waived defenseman Wade Redden and brought in several players to achieve more balanced scoring. They wore a third jersey for the first time in several years. On November 12, the Rangers unveiled the new Heritage Jersey for the first time at the rink at Rockefeller Center in a special ceremony featuring Rangers alumni and current players discussing the history of the storied franchise. The club wore the jersey for the first time on November 17 when they played the Boston Bruins at Madison Square Garden. The jersey was to be worn every time the Rangers play an Original Six team, or on a Sunday afternoon game at home. The Rangers' fate of making or missing the playoffs would come down to the final day of the regular season for the second-straight year. The team defeated the New Jersey Devils on the final day of the season to finish with 93 points on the year. In order to qualify for the 2011 playoffs, however, they needed the Carolina Hurricanes to lose their final game of the season, as Carolina owned the tiebreaker as both teams finished with the same number of points. Carolina lost its final game to Tampa Bay, 6ÿ2, putting the Rangers in the playoffs after missing-out the previous season. The Rangers then faced Washington in the first round. After blowing a 3ÿ0 third period lead in Game 4, with Washington ahead in the best-of-seven series two games to one, the Rangers lost the series in five games. It was the second time in three years that the Capitals eliminated the Rangers from the playoffs.\\r\\nOn May 13, 2011, Derek Boogaard, a player whom the Rangers signed the previous offseason for four years, was found dead in his Minnesota apartment.[36] On June 29, 2011 the Rangers bought out captain Chris Drury's contract. On July 2, 2011, Brad Richards, an unrestricted free agent who had played with the Dallas Stars during the prior season, signed a nine-year, $60 million contract to play for the Rangers.[37] On September 12, 2011, Ryan Callahan was named the 26th captain in New York Rangers history.[38] He became the fifth-youngest captain in team history.[39] Brad Richards and Marc Staal were named alternate captains on the same day.\\r\\nIn the 2011ÿ12 season, the Rangers finished as the top seed in the Eastern Conference. Recording 51 wins, 24 regulation losses and seven overtime losses, the team finished with 109 points for the regular season. Their leading scorer for the regular season was Marian Gaborik, who finished the season with 41 goals and 76 points while playing all 82 games. However, the Rangers missed-out on the Presidents' Trophy on the final day of the season to the Vancouver Canucks after a 4ÿ1 loss to Washington. In the first round of the playoffs, the Rangers faced the eighth-seeded Ottawa Senators. After falling behind 3ÿ2 in the series, the Rangers bounced back to win Game 6 in Ottawa, as well as the deciding Game 7 at home, propelling them to the Conference Semifinals. In the Semifinals, the Rangers faced the Capitals. In Game 3, Gaborik received a pass from Brad Richards to seal a victory 14:41 into the third overtime, giving the Rangers a 2ÿ1 lead in the series. Washington then came back to tie the series 2ÿ2 in Game 4. The Rangers avoided going down 3ÿ2 in the series when Richards tied Game 5 at 2ÿ2 with just 6.6 seconds left in the third period. The goal was scored on a power-play as a result of a high-sticking double-minor committed by Washington's Joel Ward on Rangers' forward Carl Hagelin. Then, in overtime, Rangers defenseman Marc Staal scored on the second penalty of the double-minor just 1:35 into overtime, giving the Rangers a 3ÿ2 series lead. The Rangers went on to win the series 4ÿ3, sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1997. In the Conference Finals, they faced the New Jersey Devils, a major divisional rival. After leading the series 2-1, the Rangers lost 3 games in a row, losing Game 6 in New Jersey with a goal by Devils forward Adam Henrique at 1:03 in overtime, giving the Devils a 4ÿ2 series win and ending the Rangers' season.\\r\\nOn July 23, 2012 the Rangers traded Brandon Dubinsky, Artem Anisimov, Tim Erixon and a 2013 first-round draft pick to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for All-Star Rick Nash, Steven Delisle, and a 2013 conditional third-round pick.[40] At the 2013 NHL trade deadline on April 3rd, the Rangers then traded Marian Gaborik, Steven Delisle, and Blake Parlett to Columbus for Derick Brassard, Derek Dorsett, John Moore, and a 2014 sixth-round draft pick.[41] After the Rangers were eliminated from the second round of the playoffs by Boston, management fired Head Coach John Tortorella, and on June 21, 2013, General Manager Glen Sather formally introduced ex-Canucks Head Coach Alain Vigneault as Tortorella's replacement, becoming the 35th head coach in franchise history.[42]\\r\\nOn March 5, 2014, the Rangers traded their captain Ryan Callahan, a first-round draft pick in 2015, a conditional second-round pick in 2014 (which later became a first-round pick), and a conditional seventh-round pick in 2015, for Tampa Bay captain Martin St. Louis and a conditional second-round pick in 2015. The trade occurred in large part after the Rangers and Callahan were unable to reach a contract extension in the days leading up to the deadline. During the regular season, the Rangers won 25 road games, setting a then-franchise record. In the first round of the 2014 playoffs, New York defeated Philadelphia in seven games, and in the next round, the Rangers rallied from a 3ÿ1 series deficit for the first time in their history to defeat Pittsburgh in seven games. They then defeated the Montreal Canadiens in six games to become the Eastern Conference champions, moving on to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 20 years. In the Finals they faced the Los Angeles Kings, the Western Conference champions and champions in 2012. The Rangers led the first two games by two goals and eventually fell in overtime, and were then shut-out at home 3ÿ0 in Game 3. The Kings outshot the Rangers in Game 4, but the Rangers staved off elimination by winning the game 2ÿ1 to force a Game 5 in Los Angeles. They had another lead in Game 5, but after the game was tied and subsequently sent to overtime, Kings defenseman Alec Martinez scored with 5:17 left in the second overtime period to win the game for Los Angeles, 3ÿ2, as well as the Stanley Cup.[43]\\r\\nOn June 20, 2014, a week after their season ended, the Rangers bought-out the remaining six years of Brad Richards' contract in order to free up salary cap space.[44] This move left Marc Staal and Dan Girardi as the team's remaining alternate captains.\\r\\nOn October 6, 2014, defenseman Ryan McDonagh was named the Rangers' 27th captain in team history, with Derek Stepan, Dan Girardi, Marc Staal and Martin St. Louis serving as alternates. In the 2014ÿ15 season, the Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy for the third time in franchise history and their 8th division title by finishing with the best record in the NHL at 53ÿ22ÿ7. The 53 wins and 113 points both set franchise records. The division title was the Rangers' first in the Metropolitan Division, which was created during the NHL's realignment in the 2013 offseason. The team won 28 road games in the regular season, breaking the franchise record set the previous season. Over the course of the season the Rangers agreed to terms on a contract extension with Cam Talbot, Marc Staal, and Mats Zuccarello. In the playoffs the Rangers dispatched the Pittsburgh Penguins in five games in the first round. The Rangers then came back from a 3ÿ1 series deficit to win their second-round series against the Capitals in seven games, becoming the first team in NHL history to battle back from a 3ÿ1 deficit in back-to-back seasons and sending the Rangers to the Eastern Conference Final for the third time in four years. However, after winning the first game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Rangers lost Game 2 by four goals. The two teams split the first four games of the series, but the Rangers lost Game 5 by a 2ÿ0 scoreline at home, which gave the Lightning an opportunity to clinch the Conference Finals in Tampa Bay. However, this did not happen in Game 6, as Derick Brassard scored a hat-trick and assisted on two other goals in an emphatic 7ÿ3 Rangers victory to force a Game 7 in New York.[45] There, the Lightning shutout the Rangers 2ÿ0, ending the Rangers' season and marking the first occasion the Rangers had ever lost a Game 7 at home in franchise history and the first time they lost an elimination game at home since they lost to Buffalo in 2007.[46]\\r\\nOn June 27, 2015 the Rangers traded Carl Hagelin and a pair of draft picks to the Anaheim Ducks for Emerson Etem and a draft pick, Cam Talbot and a draft pick to the Edmonton Oilers for three draft picks, and prospect Ryan Haggerty to the Chicago Blackhawks for Antti Raanta, who was to become the backup goaltender to Lundqvist.[47][48] Subsequently, on July 1, 2015, Glen Sather resigned as the general manager, with Jeff Gorton taking his place to become the 11th general manager in team history.[49] On July 2, 2015, Martin St. Louis announced his retirement.[50] The team then signed Emerson Etem, and re-signed Oscar Lindberg, Jesper Fast, J. T. Miller, and Derek Stepan.[51][52][53]\\r\\nThe Rangers started off the 2015ÿ16 season well. After 18 games, they had a 14ÿ2ÿ2 record and a nine-game winning streak, which was eventually halted by Tampa Bay. However, the organization soon went downhill in the winter, losing three-straight games against the Montreal Canadiens, Boston Bruins and Philadelphia Flyers. They eventually posted a 4ÿ7ÿ2 record in December for only ten points. In January the Rangers started playing more efficiently, posting a fair 6ÿ4ÿ1 record, and improved in February by going on a 10ÿ3ÿ1 run without any back-to-back losses. On January 8, 2016 the Rangers traded Emerson Etem to the Vancouver Canucks for Nicklas Jensen and a sixth-round pick in the 2017 NHL draft. On February 28th the Rangers traded prospect Aleksi Saarela, a 2016 second-round draft pick, and a 2017 second-round draft pick for Carolina Hurricanes' captain Eric Staal,[54] who later left the team after the season.[55] The Rangers finished the season third in the division with 101 points for back-to-back 100+ point seasons. Despite high hopes, the Rangers were eliminated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of the 2016 playoffs in five games. On May 2nd the Rangers agreed to terms with Antti Raanta on a contract extension,[56] and on May 13th signed Pavel Buchnevich to an entry-level contract.[57]\\r\\nOn June 25, 2016 the Rangers acquired Nick Holden from the Colorado Avalanche for a 2017 fourth-round draft pick. Over the course of the summer, the Rangers re-signed J. T. Miller, Chris Kreider, and Kevin Hayes, while Dominic Moore, among others, departed via free agency.[58] On July 18th the Rangers traded their leading scorer Derick Brassard and a 2018 seventh-round draft pick in exchange for Mika Zibanejad and a 2018 second-round draft pick,[59] The team also signed Michael Grabner to a two-year deal[60] and the much-anticipated college sensation Jimmy Vesey to a two-year entry-level contract.[61]\\r\\nThe fans of the New York Rangers have several traditions that are part of the experience of watching a home game at Madison Square Garden.\\r\\nThe Chief, whose real name was Robert Comas, was a fan of the Rangers who donned an Indian headdress complete with Ranger facepaint from 1971 to 1995. He became an unofficial mascot, \\"wandering around Madison Square Garden shaking hands, whooping and doing a war dance.\\" Comas retired from his role as The Chief in 1995, one year after the Rangers won the Stanley Cup.\\r\\nIn 1998, Comas ran for public office as the Republican Party candidate for the State Senate in the 21st District, which includes Sheepshead Bay, Mill Basin and other parts of southern Brooklyn. When he was unable to gather enough signatures to make the ballot, the Republican party had no candidate in the contest. Comas did run on the Conservative line.[62] He managed to gather 3,255 votes, or 7.64% of the total votes counted, losing to incumbent Carl Kruger, who was convicted on federal bribery charges in 2011.[63]\\r\\nShortly after his bid for the New York State Senate failed, the Chief moved to Florida, where he resided until his death on September 17, 2009. He was 62.\\r\\nDancing Larry has been a Rangers season ticket holder since 1988, and his famous dance routine began in the mid-to-late 1990s, when he danced in the aisle between sections 406 and 407. After the most recent MSG renovation, he now dances in the portal between sections 223 and 224. The dance usually occurs during the last TV timeout of the third period to get the crowd and the team pumped up. Larry dances to the song Strike It Up by Black Box which is cued up on the Madison Square Garden loud speakers by the technical staff.\\r\\nLarry's real name is Larry Goodman.[64]\\r\\nWhen the Rangers score a goal at Madison Square Garden the \\"Slapshot\\" (aka \\"The New York Rangers Goal Song\\") song is played following three blasts of a NYC Fire Engine horn. The song made its debut on January 20, 1995, the night the 1994 Stanley Cup Champion Banner was raised to the rafters. It was written by Ray Castoldi, the Music Director at Madison Square Garden. The song can be heard here.\\r\\nAfter every home victory the \\"New York Rangers Victory Song\\" is played. It was written in 1940 by J. Fred Coots (an avid Rangers fan and New Yorker) to pay tribute to the then-Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers. The music for the song can be heard here.\\r\\nAfter every Rangers home win, the team gathers at center ice and raise their sticks in the air to salute the Rangers supporters. The salute (the idea of defenseman Darius Kasparaitis) began in the early part of the 2005ÿ06 season, and has proved extremely popular with both the players and fans alike.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe salute to the fans is typically done only after home victories. However, after the Rangers fell to the rival New Jersey Devils in a four-game sweep in the first round of the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs, the fans' cheers at the conclusion of an otherwise outstanding breakout season caused the players to stay on the ice after the loss and give the fans one final salute for the year. The Rangers have saluted the crowd on several occasions since after being eliminated from the playoffs at home.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Rangers fan lore, one of the most traditional, as well as one of the rowdiest, sections of the Garden is the blue seats, in what was the 400 level, before the most recent renovation. The nickname came from the original color of those seats before the first Garden renovation in the early 1990s. In the 1970s, \\"blue-seaters\\" would heckle opposing players, and also heckle the \\"red-seaters\\", down below. This led to the perception that the blue seats were also home to a great deal of profanity, or \\"blue language.\\"\\r\\nThe seats in the 400 level at MSG were redone in teal during the 1990 renovation of the Garden, but fans continued to refer to them as \\"the blues\\".\\r\\nFollowing the 3-year transformation at the Garden that began in 2011, the blue seats now occupy only one end zone of the west side of the arena where the Rangers shoot twice. Because of the new balcony added above, these seats are considered \\"limited view\\"; they remain the cheapest seats in the building.\\r\\nJohn Amirante is the long-time national anthem singer at Madison Square Garden. He first performed the national anthem at the Garden ice in October 1980, and has also sung for the Knicks and Yankees. In 2009, when Amirante was 74, he was singing the anthem at about half of the Rangers' home games. On Saturday, April 18, 2015, after a 35-year run, Amirante sang what was thought to be his last National Anthem before Game 2 in Round 1 of the 2015 playoffs against the Pittsburgh Penguins.[65] The following day, after a negative reaction from fans regarding the decision to forcibly retire Amirante, the Garden announced that Amirante would be invited to be a guest anthem singer from time-to-time.[66]","input":"What is the new york rangers goal song called?"},{"output":"Selena Gomez","context":"This list contains the top 25 accounts with the most followers on the social photo-sharing platform Instagram.[1] As of May 2018, the most followed user is Instagram's own account, with over 235 million followers.

On April 2 the talks came to a conclusion and a press conference was held by Federica Mogherini (High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy) and Mohammad Javad Zarif (Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran) to announce that the eight parties had reached an agreement on a framework deal. The parties announced, \\"Today, we have taken a decisive step: we have reached solutions on key parameters of a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\\" which they intended to complete by June 30.[1][2][3][4] Announcing the framework, Foreign Minister Zarif stated: \\"No agreement has been reached so we do not have any obligation yet. Nobody has obligations now other than obligations that we already undertook under the Joint Plan of Action that we adopted in Geneva in November 2013.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe framework deal was embodied in a document published by the EU's European External Action Service titled Joint Statement by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif Switzerland,[1] and in a document published by the U.S. Department of State titled Parameters for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Regarding the Islamic Republic of Iran's Nuclear Program.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 14, 2015, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action between Iran and the P5+1 and EU, a comprehensive agreement based on the April 2015 framework, was announced.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 8, 2018, United States President Donald Trump announced the United States was withdrawing from the deal.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the joint statement in Switzerland, the P5+1 countries and Iran agreed on a framework for a deal. According to this framework, Iran would redesign, convert, and reduce its nuclear facilities and accept the Additional Protocol (with provisional application) in order to lift all nuclear-related economic sanctions, freeing up tens of billions of dollars in oil revenue and frozen assets.[9] In addition to the joint statement, the United States and Iran issued fact sheets of their own.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joint statement outlines the following:[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the IAEA verifies Iran's implementation of its key nuclear commitments:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the final statement, both the United States and Iran have made public more detailed descriptions of their agreement.  Officials of both sides acknowledge that they have different narratives on this draft.[10]  The U.S. government has published a fact sheet summarizing the main points of the deal.[12] Shortly after it was published, top Iranian officials, including the Iranian supreme leader and the Iranian minister of defense have disputed the document on key points which remain unresolved.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 22 July 2015, Abbas Araghchi, Irans deputy foreign minister who led the negotiations, made an announcement on state-controlled television that the recently reached nuclear deal with the world powers did not include limitations on Irans weapons capabilities or missile power and that Tehran would keep arming its regional allies. \\"We have told them [the P5+1 world powers] in the negotiations that we will supply arms to anyone and anywhere necessary and will import weapons from anywhere we want and we have clarified this during the negotiations,\\" Araghchi said.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a speech the following Saturday, Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei added, \\"Our policy will not change with regards to the arrogant US government.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to details of the deal published by the US government, Iran's uranium stockpile will be reduced by 98% to 300?kg (660?lbs) for 15 years. The level of enrichment must also remain at 3.67%. Iran will retain no more than 6,104 out of almost 20,000 centrifuges it possesses. There are two uranium enrichment facilities in IranNatanz and Fordo. Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreed on 14 July, the Natanz facility will be limited to installing no more than 5,060 of the oldest and least efficient centrifuges for 10 years. At Fordo, no enrichment will be permitted for 15 years, and the underground facility will be converted into a nuclear, physics and technology centre. 1,044 centrifuges at the site will produce radioisotopes for use in medicine, agriculture, industry and science.[17][18] This level of enrichment, 3.67%, would be enough just for peaceful and civil use to power parts of country and therefore is not sufficient for building a nuclear bomb.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to press TV report based on Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran's extra centrifuges and the related infrastructure in the Natanz facility will be collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in order to be replaced by new machines consistent with the allowed standards. Iran will be allowed to allocate the current stockpile of enriched materials for the purpose of producing nuclear fuel or swapping it with uranium in the international markets. These comprehensive solutions permit Iran to continue its enrichment program inside its territory and also allowed to continue its production of nuclear fuel for running its nuclear power plants.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. State Department fact sheet and a joint statement by Iran and the EU, Iran has agreed to convert its underground Fordo facility into a research centre for nuclear science and physics and about half of the Fordo facility would be dedicated to advanced nuclear research and production of stable radioisotopes which have important applications in medicine, agriculture, industry and science.[18] Furthermore, Iran would maintain no more than 1,044 centrifuges for this purpose.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Press TV, the implementation of JCPOA followed by lifting of all the UN Security Council sanctions as well as all economic and financial embargoes by the United States and the European Union imposed on Iran's banks, insurance, investment, and all other related services in different fields, including petrochemical, oil, gas and automobile industries will be immediately lifted all at once.[20] However, according to the fact sheet which is published by the U.S. government, U.S. and EU nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended after the IAEA has verified the implementation of the key nuclear-related steps by Iran.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIran will be required to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency access to all of its declared facilities so that the agency can be assured of the peaceful nature of the nuclear program.[19] According to details of the deal published by the U.S. government, IAEA inspectors would have access to all of the nuclear facilities including enrichment facilities, the supply chain that supports the nuclear program and uranium mines as well as  continuous surveillance at uranium mills, centrifuge rotors and bellows production and storage facilities. Iran will be required to grant access to the IAEA to investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility, conversion facility, centrifuge production facility, or yellowcake production facility anywhere in the country. Iran will implement an agreed set of measures to address the IAEAs concerns regarding the Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) of its program.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Iranian fact sheet, Iran will implement the Additional Protocol temporarily and voluntarily in line with its confidence-building measures and after that the protocol will be ratified in a time frame by the Iranian government and parliament (Majlis).[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n?United Nations?ÿ Ban Ki-moon the Secretary-General of the United Nations welcomed this agreement.[24] \\"A comprehensive, negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear issue will contribute to peace and stability in the region.\\" he said.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\n ÿ Yukiya Amano, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), with the release a manifest welcomed the compromise. \\"The IAEA welcomes the announcement by E3+3 [the 5+1 group] and Iran on the key parameters for a joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\\" Amano said in his manifest.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\n?Iran?ÿ Iran's President Hassan Rouhani welcomed the development on Twitter.[27] He said the nuclear agreement is just a step toward interaction with the world and all those countries that want to respect the Iranian nation.[28] One week after Lausanne negotiations, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, explained his idea about the negotiations. He neither accepted nor rejected the framework deal and stated that: \\"nothing has happened yet.\\" About sanctions, he proclaimed all sanctions must be completely lifted on the day when the nuclear deal is signed.[29][30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\n?Russia?ÿ Sergey Lavrov Foreign Minister of Russia considered this agreement a positive development in the security of the Middle East.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\n?United Kingdom?ÿ Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said that the framework agreement with Iran was well beyond what many thought possible even 18 months earlier.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\n?United States?ÿ President Barack Obama said a \\"historic understanding\\" had been reached with Iran,[5] and pointed out that the deal with Iran is a good deal if the deal could meet core objectives of the United States.[34] 150 Democratic House members signaled that they supported reaching a deal, enough to sustain a Presidential Veto.

It began airing on December 5, 2005, hosted by stand-up comedian Ben Bailey. It is part of the global Cash Cab franchise that originated in the United Kingdom.\\r\\nWhile Bailey's show took place in New York City, some episodes of season six took place in Las Vegas. Contestants who ultimately hailed the Cash Cab were not made aware that they were part of the game until they hired the cab and Bailey informed them of the show and its rules.\\r\\nIn 2007, Discovery Channel began airing a spin-off edition of the program, Cash Cab: After Dark, in which contestants were picked up near or after sunset as well as overnight and the cash value of the questions was double that of the regular version of the show. The questions were usually more difficult than the daytime version.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Variety, Discovery Channel initially ordered 40 episodes from Lion Television (with Executive Producers Tom Cohen, Allison Corn and Tony Tackaberry; with Ben Bailey being the most recent) and taping of the initial run was completed in November 2005 before the show premiered that December.[2] A new set of 40 episodes were taped and aired in 2006 and 2007. Another 80 episodes were taped in 2007 and aired through spring and summer. Another 40 episodes were taped and aired in 2008 and 2009. Another 40 episodes were taped for airing in 2010 and 2011.\\r\\nThe sixth season premiered on February 14, 2011, at 6:00?pm E/P. During a hiatus, Ben Bailey did a standup special recounting his time as host of the show. He correctly stated in the special that the show has been cancelled for the last two years (taping for the then-current series wrapped in 2008), however, a renewal offer was made after the standup concert was taped during 2011 returning the show to the schedule. The seventh season premiered Thursday, January 5, 2012, at 6:00?pm E/P with two half-hour episodes.\\r\\nOn April 18, 2012, it was announced that Cash Cab would end its 6-year run.[3]\\r\\nOn March 27, 2017, Discovery announced it was working on episodes that will feature \\"appearances from notables in comedy, film, and TV\\".[4] On June 5, 2017, original host Ben Bailey confirmed he would return for a new season.[5][6]\\r\\nWhen the potential contestants enter the cab and state their destination, they are made aware that they are in the Cash Cab as ceiling lights and a fanfare plays inside, accompanied by the host's greeting. While the only rules given on-camera after the introduction and before asking \\"Do you want to play?\\" pertain to his or her driving and the \\"three strikes and you're out\\" rule, the contestants are also informed that once their traveling begins, the cab will not take detours of any kind unless directed by a police officer, stop sign, traffic light or other legal means of diverting traffic. Bailey or Melewski offers them the chance to get out of the cab if they do not wish to play, and contestants who choose to play the game must stay in the cab until they reach their destination or get three strikes.\\r\\nFor the first two seasons, the first four questions were worth $25 each, the next four questions were worth $50 each, and any question thereafter was worth $100. In Cash Cab: After Dark - and beginning with the regular episodes of Season 3 - all of the money values were doubled to $50, $100 and $200. Beginning in the fourth season, some games were designated as Double Ride games, making the question values $100, $200 and $400.\\r\\nEach wrong answer earns the contestant(s) a strike. On the third strike, they forfeit all their winnings and Bailey or Melewski will immediately pull over and kick them out of the cab. Once players have exited the Cash Cab, a camera crew from the trailing production van is already on the street waiting to tape their departure.\\r\\nWhen a contestant has won at least $200 or $300 in a normal game or an After Dark game - or at least $600 on a Double Ride - and the cab is forced to stop at a traffic light, Bailey or Melewski will announce a Red Light Challenge. He or she reads a question that has multiple correct answers ÿ usually four to seven ÿ and the passenger(s) have 30 seconds to give those answers; they do not always have to give all of the answers. Since there is no penalty for an incorrect answer, giving all the correct answers in the allotted time is worth $250 - or $500 during Double Ride games - regardless of how many incorrect answers a contestant might also blurt out along the way. The contestant does not receive the extra $250 (or $500) if the 30-second time limit runs out; it is also not counted as a strike, and the contestant doesn't lose any accumulated money. While only one Red Light Challenge is usually played per game, beginning in Season 4 there are multiple Red Light Challenges during certain games - at least two per game - with the second for accumulating at least $1,000.\\r\\nContestants have two forms of help known as \\"Shout-Outs\\" at their disposal during the game; each can be used only once, and neither may be used on a Red Light Challenge or a Video Bonus. In the Mobile Shout-Out, the contestant makes a phone call to someone they choose by means of a cell phone - either provided by Bailey or Melewski - or one belonging to a contestant. The call can take up to a maximum of 15 seconds before the contestant has to give an answer, with the result being either additional money or a strike. The contestant may also elect to use a Street Shout-Out, in which Bailey or Melewski immediately pulls the cab to a curb so that anyone on the sidewalk can be asked for help, without any official time limit. A second Street Shout-Out is included on a Double Ride.\\r\\nShould the passenger(s) reach the destination without striking out, Bailey/Melewski offers a choice: the option of leaving the cab and keeping the prize money that they have won, or they can stay and try to double their money by risking it all on a Video Bonus question. Bailey/Melewski plays a video clip and asks the contestant(s) a single question based on its content. If the question is answered correctly, the contestant(s) win double what they have earned so far, but if they are wrong, they lose all of their money and \\"leave with nothing but a free cab ride\\".\\r\\nBeginning in Season 4, this rarely occurring part of the show happens when randomly selected passengers are able to win double the amount of money of a normal game. The first four questions are worth $100, the second four are worth $200 and the rest until the end of the game are worth $400. The \\"Red Light Challenge\\" is worth $500.\\r\\nThe current record of $6,200 won on one ride is held by Sam Meyer (riding solo, on a Double Ride, taking and winning the Double-or-Nothing Video Bonus question) on the episode that aired May 18, 2009.[7] This topped the old record held by contestants Sean Devney and Steve Irolla, two New York City tour guides who won $4,100 after answering the \\"Video Bonus\\" question correctly. They reached their final destination with two strikes (both on $200 questions).\\r\\nOne episode of the program was a special celebrity edition, featuring actor Thomas Haden Church of Spider-Man 3, NHL players Jed Ortmeyer and Ryan Hollweg of the New York Rangers and journalist Harry Smith, formerly of CBS' The Early Show. All played for a charity of their choice, and Discovery Channel matched the contestants' winnings. Another episode was a special in which the passengers were asked questions relating to the 2008 film Frost/Nixon. In this episode, the host of Cash Cab: Canada, Adam Growe, was driving the cab instead of Ben Bailey.\\r\\nOn April 21, 2009, Discovery aired a charity episode of Cash Cab for its 250th episode featuring two rides by boat crew members from Deadliest Catch. Time Bandit co-captain Andy Hillstrand and Josh Harris, son of Cornelia Marie captain Phil Harris, went against Sig Hansen (captain of the Northwestern) and his two brothers. All cash values were doubled from the Season 3 payouts, the passengers received a second Street Shout-Out, and all money earned was donated by the passengers to the charities of their choice.\\r\\nIn the Cash Cab: Las Vegas episodes, filmed in May 2010 and broadcast beginning in August of that year,[8] celebrities play for charity and civilians play for themselves. Guests have included Mayor of Las Vegas, Oscar Goodman, comedian David Brenner, the band Neon Trees and magicians Penn & Teller. The prizes are sometimes doubled in a \\"Double Down Ride\\", just like on the regular show. In the event they strike out or miss the Video Bonus question, their charities receive $500, though some celebrities decide to also chip in with the amount of money lost, out of their own pockets.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe show's tagline in the first two seasons was: \\"There are 13,000 cabs in New York City, but there's only one that pays you!\\" Starting in season three, the tagline was modified: \\"There are 13,000 cabs in the streets of the Big Apple, but there's only one that pays you!\\" On Cash Cab: After Dark, the tagline is: \\"Every night, 13,000 cabs hit the streets of the city that never sleeps, but there's only one that pays you!\\"\\r\\nDuring Season 6 of Cash Cab, a new spin-off series, Cash Cab: Chicago, hosted by comedian Beth Melewski and using the same rules as its New York counterpart, aired. The spin-off was cancelled after one season, but rerun episodes are aired along with Cash Cab episodes in syndication.[9] Ben Bailey stated that the show was created during contract renewal negotiations.[10]\\r\\nA support van tails the Cash Cab, containing producers and a camera crew for the various street shots. The staff provide logistical information and questions by way of a walkie-talkie and earpiece worn by the host. The Cash Cab is equipped with ten cameras: one on the host, three on the passengers, one pointing forward from the back window of the cab, and three (front, left and right) in the advertising shell on the roof of the cab showing the passing streetscape. The rear of the cab behind the seats contains ten recording decks and other production equipment.\\r\\nThe lighting and the music that go off when contestants enter the cab consist of a switchboard that is connected to an iPod and the car stereo. The Video Bonus monitor is a DVD player that is embedded to the back of the front passenger seat.\\r\\nSome contestants are randomly picked as they walk along the sidewalk, while others are selected in advance. Even so, those picked in advance are never actually told that the cab that is supposed to take them to the show turns out to be the show itself.[11]\\r\\nNear the end of the game at the player's destination Ben Bailey or Beth Melewski appears to present the cash won. In reality, this cash is a prop and used for on-air purposes only. The winnings, which must be taxed, are sent via check.[11]\\r\\nThe Cash Cab in New York is a Toyota Sienna minivan[12] with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission call sign \\"1G12\\" in the first two seasons and during the After Dark shows.

Its stated missions involve anti-terrorism, border security, immigration and customs, cyber security, and disaster prevention and management.[3] It was created in response to the September 11 attacks, and is also currently the youngest U.S. cabinet department.\\r\\nIn fiscal year 2017, it was allocated a net discretionary budget of $40.6 billion.[2] With more than 240,000 employees,[4] DHS is the third largest Cabinet department, after the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.[5] Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council. Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the Departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy.\\r\\nThe most recent Secretary, John F. Kelly, was replaced by Acting Secretary and current Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke on Monday, July 31, 2017.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereas the Department of Defense is charged with military actions abroad, the Department of Homeland Security works in the civilian sphere to protect the United States within, at, and outside its borders. Its stated goal is to prepare for, prevent, and respond to domestic emergencies, particularly terrorism.[7] On March 1, 2003, DHS absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and assumed its duties. In doing so, it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies: Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. The investigative divisions and intelligence gathering units of the INS and Customs Service were merged forming Homeland Security Investigations. Additionally, the border enforcement functions of the INS, including the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Federal Protective Service falls under the National Protection and Programs Directorate.\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security is headed by the Secretary of Homeland Security with the assistance of the Deputy Secretary. The Department contains the components listed below.[8]\\r\\nAgencies:\\r\\n(Passports for U.S. citizens are issued by the United States Department of State, not the Department of Homeland Security.)\\r\\nAdvisory groups:\\r\\nOther components:\\r\\nIn an August 5, 2002 speech, President Bush said: \\"We're fighting ... to secure freedom in the homeland.\\"[25] Prior to the creation of DHS, American presidents had referred to the U.S. as \\"the nation\\" or \\"the republic\\", and to its internal policies as \\"domestic\\".[26] Also unprecedented was the use, from 2002, of the phrase \\"the homeland\\" by White House spokespeople.[26]\\r\\nIn 2011, the Department of Homeland Security phased out the old Homeland Security Advisory System, replacing it with a two-level National Terrorism Advisory System. The system has two types of advisories: Alerts and Bulletins. NTAS Bulletins permit the Secretary to communicate critical terrorism information that, while not necessarily indicative of a specific threat against the United States, can reach homeland security partners or the public quickly, thereby allowing recipients to implement necessary protective measures. Alerts are issued when there is specific and credible information of a terrorist threat against the United States. Alerts themselves have two levels: Elevated and Imminent. An Elevated Alert is issued when there is credible information about an attack but only general information about timing or a target. An Imminent Alert is issued when the threat is very specific and impending in the very near term.\\r\\nOn March 12, 2002, the Homeland Security Advisory System, a color-coded terrorism risk advisory scale, was created as the result of a Presidential Directive to provide a \\"comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding the risk of terrorist acts to Federal, State, and local authorities and to the American people.\\" Many procedures at government facilities are tied into the alert level; for example a facility may search all entering vehicles when the alert is above a certain level. Since January 2003, it has been administered in coordination with DHS; it has also been the target of frequent jokes and ridicule on the part of the administration's detractors about its ineffectiveness. After resigning, Tom Ridge stated that he did not always agree with the threat level adjustments pushed by other government agencies.[27]\\r\\nIn January 2003, the office[clarification needed] was merged into the Department of Homeland Security and the White House Homeland Security Council, both of which were created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Council, similar in nature to the National Security Council, retains a policy coordination and advisory role and is led by the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security.[28]\\r\\nAs of 13 January 2011, the DHS advised the American public of an 'elevated national threat' level, recommending that all Americans 'should establish an emergency preparedness kit and emergency plan for themselves and their family, and stay informed about what to do during an emergency'.[29]\\r\\nIn response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush announced the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security (OHS) to coordinate \\"homeland security\\" efforts. The office was headed by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, who assumed the title of Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. The official announcement stated:\\r\\nRidge began his duties as OHS director on October 8, 2001.\\r\\nAccording to Peter Andreas, a border theorist, the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War,[30] and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947, which placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency. DHS also constitutes the most diverse merger of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization.[31]\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security was established on November 25, 2002, by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. It was intended to consolidate U.S. executive branch organizations related to \\"homeland security\\" into a single Cabinet agency. The following 22 agencies were incorporated into the new department:[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the signing of the bill, controversy about its adoption centered on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency should be incorporated in part or in whole (neither were included). The bill itself was also controversial for the presence of unrelated \\"riders\\", as well as for eliminating certain union-friendly civil service and labor protections for department employees. Without these protections, employees could be expeditiously reassigned or dismissed on grounds of security, incompetence or insubordination, and DHS would not be required to notify their union representatives.\\r\\nThe plan stripped 180,000 government employees of their union rights.[33] In 2002, Bush officials argued that the September 11 attacks made the proposed elimination of employee protections imperative.[34]\\r\\nCongress ultimately passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002 without the union-friendly measures, and President Bush signed the bill into law on November 25, 2002. It was the largest U.S. government reorganization in the 50 years since the United States Department of Defense was created.\\r\\nTom Ridge was named secretary on January 24, 2003 and began naming his chief deputies. DHS officially began operations on January 24, 2003, but most of the department's component agencies were not transferred into the new Department until March 1.[28]\\r\\nAfter establishing the basic structure of DHS and working to integrate its components and get the department functioning, Ridge announced his resignation on November 30, 2004, following the re-election of President Bush. Bush initially nominated former New York City Police Department commissioner Bernard Kerik as his successor, but on December 10, Kerik withdrew his nomination, citing personal reasons and saying it \\"would not be in the best interests\\" of the country for him to pursue the post.\\r\\nOn January 11, 2005, President Bush nominated federal judge Michael Chertoff to succeed Ridge. Chertoff was confirmed on February 15, 2005, by a vote of 98ÿ0 in the U.S. Senate. He was sworn in the same day.[28]\\r\\nIn February 2005, DHS and the Office of Personnel Management issued rules relating to employee pay and discipline for a new personnel system named MaxHR. The Washington Post said that the rules would allow DHS \\"to override any provision in a union contract by issuing a department-wide directive\\" and would make it \\"difficult, if not impossible, for unions to negotiate over arrangements for staffing, deployments, technology and other workplace matters.\\"[34]\\r\\nIn August 2005, U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer blocked the plan on the grounds that it did not ensure collective-bargaining rights for DHS employees.[34]\\r\\nA federal appeals court ruled against DHS in 2006; pending a final resolution to the litigation, Congress's fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for DHS provided no funding for the proposed new personnel system.[34] DHS announced in early 2007 that it was retooling its pay and performance system and retiring the name \\"MaxHR\\".[28]\\r\\nIn a February 2008 court filing, DHS said that it would no longer pursue the new rules, and that it would abide by the existing civil service labor-management procedures. A federal court issued an order closing the case.[34]\\r\\nA DHS press release dated June 6, 2003[35] explains the seal as follows:\\r\\nThe seal is symbolic of the Department's mission ÿ to prevent attacks and protect Americans ÿ on the land, in the sea and in the air. In the center of the seal, a graphically styled white American eagle appears in a circular blue field. The eagle's outstretched wings break through an inner red ring into an outer white ring that contains the words \\"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF\\" in the top half and \\"HOMELAND SECURITY\\" in the bottom half in a circular placement. The eagle's wings break through the inner circle into the outer ring to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will break through traditional bureaucracy and perform government functions differently. In the tradition of the Great Seal of the United States, the eagle's talon on the left holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 seeds while the eagle's talon on the right grasps 13 arrows.\\r\\nCentered on the eagle's breast is a shield divided into three sections containing elements that represent the American homeland ÿ air, land, and sea. The top element, a dark blue sky, contains 22 stars representing the original 22 entities that have come together to form the department. The left shield element contains white mountains behind a green plain underneath a light blue sky. The right shield element contains four wave shapes representing the oceans alternating light and dark blue separated by white lines.\\r\\nThe seal was developed with input from senior DHS leadership, employees, and the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts. The Ad Council ÿ which partners with DHS on its Ready.gov campaign ÿ and the consulting company Landor Associates were responsible for graphic design and maintaining heraldic integrity.\\r\\nSince its inception, the department has had its temporary headquarters in Washington, D.C.'s Nebraska Avenue Complex, a former naval facility. The 38-acre (15?ha) site, across from American University, has 32 buildings comprising 566,000 square feet (52,600?m2) of administrative space.[36] In early 2007, the Department submitted a $4.1 billion plan to Congress to consolidate its 60-plus Washington-area offices into a single headquarters complex at the St. Elizabeths Hospital campus in Anacostia, Southeast Washington, D.C. The earliest DHS would begin moving to St. Elizabeths is 2012.[37]\\r\\nThe move is being championed by District of Columbia officials because of the positive economic impact it will have on historically depressed Anacostia. The move has been criticized by historic preservationists, who claim the revitalization plans will destroy dozens of historic buildings on the campus.[38] Community activists have criticized the plans because the facility will remain walled off and have little interaction with the surrounding area.[39] On January 8, 2009, the National Capital Planning Commission approved the Department of Homeland Security's plans to move into the campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital.[40] In February 2015 the General Services Administration said that the site would open in 2021.[41]\\r\\nSoon after the formation of Department of Homeland Security, the department worked with the Ad Council to launch the Ready Campaign, a national public service advertising (PSA) campaign to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to emergencies including natural and man-made disasters. With pro bono creative support from the Martin Agency of Richmond, Virginia, the campaign website \\"Ready.gov\\" and materials were conceived in March 2002 and launched in February 2003, just before the launch of the Iraq War.[42][43][44] One of the first announcements that garnered widespread public attention to this campaign was one by Tom Ridge in which he stated that in the case of a chemical attack, citizens should use duct tape and plastic sheeting to build a homemade bunker, or \\"sheltering in place\\" to protect themselves.[45][46] As a result, the sales of duct tape skyrocketed and DHS was criticized for being too alarmist.[47]\\r\\nOn March 1, 2003, the Federal Emergency Management Agency was absorbed into the DHS, and in fall of 2008, took over coordination of the campaign. The Ready Campaign and its Spanish language version Listo.gov asks individuals to do three things: build an emergency supply kit,[48] make a family emergency plan[49] and be informed about the different types of emergencies that can occur and how to respond.[50] The campaign messages have been promoted through television, radio, print, outdoor and web PSAs,[51] as well as brochures, toll-free phone lines and the English and Spanish language websites Ready.gov and Listo.gov.\\r\\nThe general campaign aims to reach all Americans, but targeted resources are also available via Ready Business for small- to medium-sized business and Ready Kids for parents and teachers of children ages 8ÿ12. In 2015, the campaign also launched a series of PSAs to help the whole community,[52] people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs prepare for emergencies, which included open captioning, a certified deaf interpreter and audio descriptions for viewers who are blind or have low vision.[53]\\r\\nOn March 1, 2004, the National Incident Management System (NIMS) was created. The stated purpose was to provide a consistent incident management approach for federal, state, local, and tribal governments. Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5, all federal departments were required to adopt the NIMS and to use it in their individual domestic incident management and emergency prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation program and activities.\\r\\nIn December 2004, the National Response Plan (NRP) was created, in an attempt to align federal coordination structures, capabilities, and resources into a unified, all-discipline, and all-hazards approach to domestic incident management. The NRP was built on the template of the NIMS.\\r\\nOn January 22, 2008, the National Response Framework was published in the Federal Register as an updated replacement of the NRP, effective March 22, 2008.\\r\\nThe Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act directs the DHS Secretary to designate employees from throughout the Department to staff a Surge Capacity Force (SCF). During a declared disaster, the DHS Secretary will determine if SCF support is necessary. The Secretary will then authorize FEMA to task and deploy designated personnel from DHS components and other Federal Executive Agencies to respond to extraordinary disasters.[54]\\r\\nThe DHS National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) is responsible for the response system, risk management program, and requirements for cyber-security in the U.S. The division is home to US-CERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System.[55][56] The DHS Science and Technology Directorate helps government and private end-users transition to new cyber-security capabilities. This directorate also funds the Cyber Security Research and Development Center, which identifies and prioritizes research and development for NCSD.[56] The center works on the Internet's routing infrastructure (the SPRI program) and Domain Name System (DNSSEC), identity theft and other online criminal activity (ITTC), Internet traffic and networks research (PREDICT datasets and the DETER testbed), Department of Defense and HSARPA exercises (Livewire and Determined Promise), and wireless security in cooperation with Canada.[57]\\r\\nOn October 30, 2009, DHS opened the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center. The center brings together government organizations responsible for protecting computer networks and networked infrastructure.[58]\\r\\nIn the United States Federal Budget for 2010, entitled 'A New Era of Responsibility', the DHS was allocated a discretionary budget of $42.7 billion (financial year 2009: $40.1 billion).[59] The end-of-year DHS Annual Financial Report for financial year 2010 showed a net cost of operations of $56.4 billion (FY 2009, restated: $49.9 billion), out of total budgetary resources of $83.2 billion (FY 2009, restated: $85.2 billion).[60] The components with the highest net cost were US Coast Guard ($12.1 billion), U.S. Customs and Border Protection ($11.6 billion), and Federal Emergency Management Agency ($10.5 billion).[60] Revenues of $10.4 billion were generated in the year (FY 2009, restated: $9.8 billion).[60]\\r\\nAccording to the Washington Post, \\"DHS has given $31 billion in grants since 2003 to state and local governments for homeland security and to improve their ability to find and protect against terrorists, including $3.8 billion in 2010.\\"[61]\\r\\nThe DHS independent auditor is KPMG, one of the Big Four audit firms.[62] Due to the level of material weaknesses identified, KPMG was unable to audit the DHS financial statements for FY 2010.[62] KPMG was unable to express an audit opinion on the FY 2009,[63] FY 2008,[64] FY 2007,[65] FY 2005,[66] and FY 2003[67] financial statements. Attempts to access the reports for FY 2006 and FY 2004 within the 'information for citizens' portal met with a 404 error.[68] The Message from the DHS Chief Financial Officer in the FY 2010 report states 'This Annual Financial Report (AFR) is our principal financial statement of accountability to the President, Congress and the American public. The AFR gives a comprehensive view of the Department's financial activities and demonstrates the Department's stewardship of taxpayer dollars.'[69] The Message from the DHS Chief Financial Officer concludes 'I am extremely proud of the Department's accomplishments ... we will continue to build upon our successes.'[69] The Secretary of Homeland Security endorsed this message saying that the DHS is 'continuing to be responsible stewards of taxpayer resources. The scope of our mission is broad, challenging, and vital to the security of the Nation ... Thank you for your partnership and collaboration. Yours very truly, Janet Napolitano.'[70]\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security has received substantial criticism over excessive bureaucracy, waste, fraud, ineffectiveness and lack of transparency. Its information sharing centers have been accused of violating American civil liberties and targeting American citizens as potential threats to national security.\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been dogged by persistent criticism over excessive bureaucracy, waste, ineffectiveness and lack of transparency. Congress estimates that the department has wasted roughly $15 billion in failed contracts (as of September 2008[update]).[71] In 2003, the department came under fire after the media revealed that Laura Callahan, Deputy Chief Information Officer at DHS with responsibilities for sensitive national security databases, had obtained her bachelor, masters, and doctorate computer science degrees through Hamilton University, a diploma mill in a small town in Wyoming.[72] The department was blamed for up to $2 billion of waste and fraud after audits by the Government Accountability Office revealed widespread misuse of government credit cards by DHS employees, with purchases including beer brewing kits, $70,000 of plastic dog booties that were later deemed unusable, boats purchased at double the retail price (many of which later could not be found), and iPods ostensibly for use in \\"data storage\\".[73][74][75][76]\\r\\nA 2015 inspection of IT infrastructure found that the department was running over a hundred computer systems whose owners were unknown, including Secret and Top Secret databases, many with out of date security or weak passwords. Basic security reviews were absent, and the department had apparently made deliberate attempts to delay publication of information about the flaws.[77]\\r\\nThe Associated Press reported on September 5, 2007, that DHS had scrapped an anti-terrorism data mining tool called ADVISE (Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight and Semantic Enhancement) after the agency's internal Inspector General found that pilot testing of the system had been performed using data on real people without required privacy safeguards in place.[78][79] The system, in development at Lawrence Livermore and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory since 2003, has cost the agency $42 million to date. Controversy over the program is not new; in March 2007, the Government Accountability Office stated that \\"the ADVISE tool could misidentify or erroneously associate an individual with undesirable activity such as fraud, crime or terrorism.\\" Homeland Security's Inspector General later said that ADVISE was poorly planned, time-consuming for analysts to use, and lacked adequate justifications.[80]\\r\\nFusion centers are terrorism prevention and response centers, many of which were created under a joint project between the Department of Homeland Security and the US Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs between 2003 and 2007. The fusion centers gather information not only from government sources, but also from their partners in the private sector.[81][82]\\r\\nThey are designed to promote information sharing at the federal level between agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Justice, US Military and state and local level government. As of July 2009[update], the Department of Homeland Security recognized at least seventy-two fusion centers.[83] Fusion centers may also be affiliated with an Emergency Operations Center that responds in the event of a disaster.\\r\\nThere are a number of documented criticisms of fusion centers, including relative ineffectiveness at counterterrorism activities, the potential to be used for secondary purposes unrelated to counterterrorism, and their links to violations of civil liberties of American citizens and others.[84]\\r\\nDavid Rittgers of the Cato Institute has noted:\\r\\na long line of fusion center and DHS reports labeling broad swaths of the public as a threat to national security. The North Texas Fusion System labeled Muslim lobbyists as a potential threat; a DHS analyst in Wisconsin thought both pro- and anti-abortion activists were worrisome; a Pennsylvania homeland security contractor watched environmental activists, Tea Party groups, and a Second Amendment rally; the Maryland State Police put anti-death penalty and anti-war activists in a federal terrorism database; a fusion center in Missouri thought that all third-party voters and Ron Paul supporters were a threat....[85]\\r\\nThe Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) made news in 2009 for targeting supporters of third party candidates (such as Ron Paul), pro-life activists, and conspiracy theorists as potential militia members.[86] Anti-war activists and Islamic lobby groups were targeted in Texas, drawing criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union.[87]\\r\\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security:[88]\\r\\nThe Privacy Office has identified a number of risks to privacy presented by the fusion center program:\\r\\nIn early April 2009, the Virginia Fusion Center came under criticism for publishing a terrorism threat assessment which stated that certain universities are potential hubs for terror related activity.[89] The report targeted historically black colleges and identified hacktivism as a form of terrorism.[90]\\r\\nIn 2006, MSNBC reported that Grant Goodman, \\"an 81-year-old retired University of Kansas history professor, received a letter from his friend in the Philippines that had been opened and resealed with a strip of dark green tape bearing the words \\"by Border Protection\\" and carrying the official Homeland Security seal.\\"[91] The letter was sent by a devout Catholic Filipino woman with no history of supporting Islamic terrorism.[91] A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection \\"acknowledged that the agency can, will and does open mail coming to U.S. citizens that originates from a foreign country whenever it's deemed necessary\\":\\r\\n\\"All mail originating outside the United States Customs territory that is to be delivered inside the U.S. Customs territory is subject to Customs examination,\\" says the CBP Web site. That includes personal correspondence. \\"All mail means 'all mail,'\\" said John Mohan, a CBP spokesman, emphasizing the point.[91]\\r\\nThe Department declined to outline what criteria are used to determine when a piece of personal correspondence should be opened or to say how often or in what volume Customs might be opening mail.[91]\\r\\nGoodman's story provoked outrage in the blogosphere,[92] as well as in the more established media. Reacting to the incident, Mother Jones remarked that \\"[u]nlike other prying government agencies, Homeland Security wants you to know it is watching you.\\"[93] CNN observed that \\"[o]n the heels of the NSA wiretapping controversy, Goodman's letter raises more concern over the balance between privacy and security.\\"[94]\\r\\nIn July 2006, the Office of Personnel Management conducted a survey of federal employees in all 36 federal agencies on job satisfaction and how they felt their respective agency was headed. DHS was last or near to last in every category including;\\r\\nThe low scores were attributed to major concerns about basic supervision, management and leadership within the agency. Examples from the survey reveal most concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit, dealing with poor performance, rewarding creativity and innovation, leadership generating high levels of motivation in the workforce, recognition for doing a good job, lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization.[95][96]\\r\\nDHS is the only large federal agency to score below 50% in overall survey rankings. It was last of large federal agencies in 2014 with 44.0% and fell even lower in 2015 at 43.1%, again last place.[97]\\r\\nIn the latest Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests, published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the Department of Homeland Security earned a D by scoring 69 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade. It also had not updated its FOIA policies since the 2007 FOIA amendments.[98]","input":"When was the office of homeland security created?"},{"output":"in the 1960s and 1970s","context":"Australia is one of many countries that have water fluoridation programs currently operating (see Fluoridation by country). As of March 2012, artificially fluoridated drinking water is provided for 70% or more of the population in all states and territories. The acceptance of the benefits of water fluoridation occurred in Australia in December 1953, roughly two years after acceptance in the United States.[2] Many of Australia's drinking water supplies subsequently began fluoridation in the 1960s and 1970s. By 1984 almost 66% of the Australian population had access to fluoridated drinking water, represented by 850 towns and cities.[3][4] Some areas within Australia have natural fluoride levels in the groundwater, which was estimated in 1991 to provide drinking water to approximately 0.9% of the population.[3]\\r\\nA key difference between the implementation of drinking water fluoridation in the United States and Australia was the impact of temperature and climate on water consumption. Temperatures are a key factor in the establishment of legislative requirements, such as the Water Fluoridation Regulation 2008[5] in Queensland, that prescribe concentrations of fluoride to be added to the water. Consequently, areas with higher average temperatures require less fluoride to be added to the drinking water to achieve the same oral health benefits. The tropical conditions found in parts of Australia, such as Queensland, also make it difficult to maintain fluoridation equipment due to higher levels of corrosion caused by the wet climate.\\r\\nThe addition of fluoride to a drinking water supply is generally governed by the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines.[6] The Guidelines recommend a health-related guideline value (maximum concentration) of 1.5?mg/L for fluoride, which mirrors the World Health Organisation Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality 2006.[7] Guidance on the concentration of fluoride has been present in the Guidelines since 1983.\\r\\nLike other countries with water fluoridation programs, Australia has organised anti-fluoride groups that contest the health benefits of fluoride. In addition to claiming that fluoride offers no health benefits whatsoever, they claim that moderate fluoride exposure can lead to reduced IQ, damaged bones, brain, kidneys and thyroid, dental fluorosis, and many more severe effects.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first town to fluoridate the water supply in Australia was Beaconsfield, Tasmania in 1953.[9][10] Although all public water supplies in Tasmania are fluoridated, approximately 15% of the residents do not have access to public water supplies.[11] The fluoridation of drinking water supplies in Tasmania is regulated by the Fluoridation Act 1968.[12] Under the Act, the need to add fluoride to a water supply is assessed by a fluoridation committee, which then provides a recommendation to the Health Minister. The Health Minister may then choose to direct the water authority to add fluoride to the water.\\r\\nApproximately 95% of the population has access to fluoridated water (September 2011). Fluoridation commenced in New South Wales with Yass in 1956,[13] with Sydney fluoridating in 1968.[3] The use of fluoride is regulated by the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Act 1957,[14] and the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Regulation 2007.[15]\\r\\nFluoride has been added to water supplies in Canberra and the City of Queanbeyan since 1964. The addition of fluoride is regulated by the Electricity and Water (Amendment) Act (No. 2) 1989 [16] and the Public Health (Drinking Water) Code of Practice 2007 (No 1).[17] There was a brief period in 1989 where fluoridation was suspended following a formal review of the effectiveness of fluoridation on oral health.[3] As only one water supplier provides all of the water for these areas, the percentage of the population with access to fluoridated water has always been 100% during the times in which it was added.\\r\\nWater fluoridation was introduced in Western Australia in Perth in 1968, and is regulated by the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Act 1966.[18] As of 2012, around 92% of the population is provided with fluoridated water through a drinking water supply.[19] An exception exists in the Busselton, Vasse and Wonnerup townsites (approximately 20,000 residents), where fluoride is not artificially added to the water because it has naturally occurring fluoride.[20] Proposals for the addition of fluoride to a public water supply or matters relating to the Act and its administration are dealt with by the Advisory Committee for the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies.[21]\\r\\nWater fluoridation commenced in Adelaide in 1971. There is no legal requirement to add fluoride to drinking water supplies. As of 2010, 90% of the states communities have access to reticulated water with appropriate levels of fluoride.[22]\\r\\nFluoride has been added to public water supplies in Darwin (since 1972), Katherine, and Gove. Similarly to South Australia, there is no legal requirement to add fluoride to the Northern Territory's water supplies, but a position paper [23] published in November 2010 strongly encourages water providers to add fluoride where possible. Supplies south of Elliott have naturally occurring fluoride at levels sufficient to provide an oral health benefit.[24] Approximately 9% of the population of Northern Territory have naturally fluoridated water.[3] As of 2012, 70% of the population in the Northern Territory has access to fluoridated water, and there are plans to extend access to more residents by 2015.[25]\\r\\nFluoride was first added to the drinking water for the Victorian town of Bacchus Marsh in 1962, with Melbourne beginning fluoridation in 1977.[26] The towns of Portland, Nhill, Port Fairy, Barnawartha, and Kaniva have naturally occurring fluoride in their drinking water.[27] In August 2012 approximately 90% of the Victorian population had access to fluoridated water.[28] The fluoridation of Victoria's drinking water supplies is regulated by the Health (Fluoridation) Act 1973, by the Department of Health.[29]\\r\\nOn 29 November 2012 the Queensland Parliament, with a Liberal National Party government, reversed the previous Labor government's mandate requiring certain public potable water supplies to add fluoride to the water. As a consequence of these changes local councils in Queensland have the choice to add fluoride to drinking water supplies, similar to the conditions in place under the previous legislation. In January 2013 the Cairns council decided to discontinue water fluoridation.[30]\\r\\nThe previous government, under Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, announced on 5 December 2007 that the mandatory fluoridation of most of Queensland's water supplies will begin in 2008.[31] When it was enacted the Water Fluoridation Act 2008 required the addition of fluoride to any water supply supplying potable water to at least 1000 members of the public, unless an exemption is granted based on safety or naturally occurring levels that meet the required levels.[32] The fluoridation of drinking water supplies is regulated by Queensland Health,[33] with implementation supported by the former Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation.[34] Prior to this legislation Queensland was the only Australian state without a formal statewide program for the addition of fluoride to drinking water.\\r\\nThe accompanying Water Fluoridation Regulation 2008 listed 134 drinking water supplies that were to be fluoridated by 31 December 2012.[35] Of the drinking water supplies listed in the Regulation, 32 comprised the SEQ Water Grid located in Southeast Queensland. The fluoridation of these supplies by the end of 2009 accounted for the largest increase in people currently receiving fluoridated water in Queensland (approximately 2.6 million people in 2006 or 68% of the Queensland population).\\r\\nBefore the 2008 legislation the addition of fluoride to water supplies was regulated by the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Act 1963.[36] Under this legislation only 5% of drinking water supplies were fluoridated. Queensland was unique in that it did not pursue water fluoridation like all the other Australian States and Territories, with only 7 of the 850 fluoridated supplies in 1984 operating in Queensland.[4] Those supplies operated in the towns of Biloela, Dalby, Gatton, Mareeba, Moranbah, and Townsville/Thuringowa, with some adding fluoride to their drinking water since 1972. A few of these towns stopped adding fluoride prior to the Water Fluoridation Act 2008.[37]\\r\\nSeveral areas of Queensland, such as Julia Creek, Quilpie, Thargomindah and Adavale are known to have naturally occurring fluoride present in their drinking water, a characteristic that has been studied since the late 1920s.[38][39]\\r\\nIn 2009 an accident occurred at the North Pine treatment plant, and some homes received water having many times the recommended level of fluoride.[40][41]\\r\\nGladstone Regional Council has voted to remove fluoride from their water supply.[42]\\r\\nMackay council votes to remove fluoride from their water supply.

It is the seat of the archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, and a parish church, located on the east side of Fifth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets in Midtown Manhattan, directly across the street from Rockefeller Center, facing the Atlas statue. It is considered one of the most visible symbols of Roman Catholicism in New York City and the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land on which the present cathedral stands was purchased in 1810.[5][6] The Jesuit community built a college on the site,[7] three miles north of the city. It contained a \\"fine old house\\" which was fitted with a chapel of St. Ignatius.[8] The school closed in 1814 and the Jesuits sold the lot to the diocese. In 1813, the diocese gave use of the property to Dom Augustin LeStrange, abbot of a community of Trappists (from the original monastery of La Trappe) who came to America fleeing persecution by French authorities. In addition to a small monastic community, they also looked after some thirty-three orphans. With the downfall of Napoleon in that year, the Trappists returned to France in 1815, abandoning the property. The property at this point was designated for a future cemetery. The neighboring orphanage was maintained by the diocese into the late nineteenth century. Some of the Trappists resettled to Canada and eventually founded St. Joseph's Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts.[9]\\r\\nBishop DuBois reopened the chapel in 1840 for Catholics employed at the Deaf and Dumb Asylum and in the general neighborhood.[8] A modest frame church was built for the parish of St. John the Evangelist and dedicated May 9, 1841 by the Rev. John Hughes, administrator of the diocese. Tickets were sold to the dedication to ease the parish's debt level, managed by a lay Board of Trustees, but to no avail and the property mortgage was finally foreclosed on and the church sold at auction in 1844.[8] The stress is said to have contributed to the death that year of the church's pastor, the Rev. Felix Larkin.[8] The experience was blamed on the management of the trustees and this incident is said to have played a significant role in the abolishment of the lay trusteeship, which occurred shortly thereafter.[8] The young and energetic Rev. Michael A. Curran was appointed to raise funds for the devastated parish, and shortly fitted up an old college hall as a temporary church.[8] Fr. Curran continued raising funds to buy back the church during the Great Famine in Ireland, eventually succeeding and taking the deed in his own name.[8] \\"The site of St. Patrick's Cathedral, hence, came to the Church through the labors of this young priest and the self-denial of his countrymen and not by the gift of the city.\\"[8] The debt was finally all paid for by 1853 when it was clear a large church was needed and the site was selected as appropriate for the new cathedral.[8]\\r\\nThe Diocese of New York, created in 1808, was made an archdiocese by Pope Pius IX on July 19, 1850. In 1853, Archbishop John Joseph Hughes announced his intention to erect a new cathedral to replace the Old Saint Patrick's Cathedral in Lower Manhattan. The new cathedral was designed by James Renwick Jr. in the Gothic Revival style. On August 15, 1858, the cornerstone was laid, just south of the diocese's orphanage. At that time, present-day midtown Manhattan was far north of the populous areas of New York City.[10]\\r\\nWork began in 1858 but was halted during the Civil War and resumed in 1865. The cathedral was completed in 1878 and dedicated on May 25, 1879, its huge proportions dominating the midtown of that time. The archbishop's house and rectory were added in 1880, both by James Renwick Jr., and an adjacent school (no longer in existence) opened in 1882.[11] The spires were added in 1888, and at 329 feet and 6 inches (100.4 meters) were the tallest structures in New York City and the second highest in the United States.[1] An addition on the east, including a Lady chapel, designed by Charles T. Matthews, was constructed from 1901 to 1906.[11] The Lady Chapel's stained-glass windows were made between 1912 and 1930 by English stained glass artist and designer Paul Vincent Woodroffe.[12] In 1927 and 1931, the cathedral was renovated, which included enlarging the sanctuary and installing the great organ.[13] The cathedral and associated buildings were declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976.[5][14][15]\\r\\nAn extensive restoration of the cathedral was begun in 2012 and lasted 3 years at a cost of $177 million.[16] The restoration was completed by September 17, 2015, before Pope Francis visited the cathedral on September 24 and 25, 2015.[17] The restoration cleaned the exterior marble, repaired stained glass windows, and painted the ceiling, repaired the flooring and steps, among many restorations.[18]\\r\\nOn October 13, 1914, a bomb exploded on the Northwest corner of St. Patrick's Cathedral. It caused a panic, but not severe damage, splintering some and tearing an 18-inch hole in the floor. Despite a full church that day, there was only one victim ÿ a young boy ÿ whose head was grazed by a flying piece of metal. Authorities believed this event was linked to another bombing earlier that day, downtown at St. Alphonsus Church on West Broadway.[19] The Communists reportedly celebrated bombings at this and other churches, while police suspected an Industrial Workers of the World plot.[20] There were no arrests made that day.\\r\\nIn March 1915, Italian anarchists, Frank Abarno, and Carmine Carbone were arrested for attempting to detonate a bomb in the cathedral. Arbarno and Carbone were under the influence of Luigi Galleani. Abarno was in St. Patrick's ready to light the bomb fuse when Amedeo Polignani, a New York City police detective, who had gone undercover to infiltrate the group, intervened. Polignani had been operating under the direction of the head of the bomb squad, Thomas Tunney. Arbano was arrested at the scene and Carbone was arrested at his home. The two defendants claimed entrapment, but were nonetheless convicted and given sentences of between 6 and 12 years.[21][22][23]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, starting in January 1951, a letter threatened that a bomb would be set off at a Sunday mass, and there would be five more threats between December 1951 and July 1952. On July 12, a voice over the telephone warned \\"your beautiful cathedral will be blown up before midnight.\\"[24]\\r\\nSt. Patrick's Cathedral is the largest decorated Neo-Gothic-style Catholic cathedral in North America. The cathedral, which can accommodate 3,000 people, is built of brick clad in marble, quarried in Massachusetts and New York. The main block of the cathedral is made of Tuckahoe marble.[25] It takes up a whole city block, between 50th and 51st streets, Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue. At the transepts it is 174 feet (53.0 meters) wide and 332 feet (101.2 meters) long. The spires rise 330 feet (100.6 meters) from street level. The slate for the roof came from Monson, Maine.[12]\\r\\nThe windows were made by artists in Boston, Massachusetts, and European artists from Chartres, France, and Birmingham, England. Charles Connick created the rose window.[12]\\r\\nThe Roman artist Paolo Medici designed the Saint Elizabeth altar. The Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle altar, one of the few original side-chapel altars, was sculpted by Dominic Borgia. The Papal bull is featured in the adjoining stained-glass window. Tiffany & Co. designed the Saint Louis and the Saint Michael altar.[12]\\r\\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, there was a renovation of the cathedral's main altar area under the guidance of Archbishop Francis Spellman, who later became cardinal. The previous high altar and reredos were removed and are now located at Spellman's alma mater, Fordham University, in the University Church. The new items include the sanctuary bronze baldachin and the rose stained glass window. The altar was further renovated in the 1980s, under the direction of Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor. To be more visible to the congregation, a stone altar was built from sections of the side altars and added to the middle of the sanctuary.[12] However, this altar was removed in 2013.\\r\\nThe Piet, sculpted by William Ordway Partridge, is three times larger than Michelangelo's Piet. The cathedral's Stations of the Cross won an 1893 artistry prize at Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition. Commemorating his visit to the city in 1979, Pope John Paul II's bust is located in the rear of the cathedral.[12]\\r\\nSt. Patricks Cathedral has two pipe organs. The Gallery Organ is located in the Choir Gallery below the Rose Window over the Fifth Avenue entrance and in the Triforium, near the South Transept. The Chancell Organ is located in the North Ambulatory next to the Chapel of St. Joseph.\\r\\nThe first organ in the Cathedral was built by George Jardine & Son, one of New York's most distinguished organ builders, and installed in 1879. It was composed of 4 manuals with 51 stops and 56 ranks.\\r\\nIn 1880, J.H. & C.S. Odell, then also from New York City, installed an organ in the chancel. It was composed of 2 manuals with 20 stops and 23 ranks.\\r\\nWith the addition to the music staff of Pietro Yon in 1927, plans were initiated to replace the organs. The firm of George Kilgen & Son of St. Louis, Missouri, was engaged to build two new instruments according to designs which were heavily influenced by the Cathedral's world-renowned organist.\\r\\nDuring the building period it was determined that the Gallery would need to be extended to accommodate the new Gallery Organ. In the late 1920s, a concrete reinforced extension to the original Gallery was constructed.\\r\\nThe Chancel Organ was dedicated on January 30, 1928. It is encased in a carved oak screen ornamented with Gothic elements of design and symbolism. It had 1,480 pipes; located on the opposite side of the Ambulatory, diagonally across from the console.\\r\\nThe Gallery Organ, dedicated on February 11, 1930, required three years to build at a cost of $250,000. It has one of the nation's most glorious wood facades. It was designed by Robert J. Reiley, consulting architect of the Cathedral, and is adorned with angels and Latin inscriptions. It contained 7,855 pipes ranging in length from thirty-two feet to one-half inch. The longest pipes run horizontally across the North and South Triforia.\\r\\nIn the 1940s and 1950s tonal changes were made. In the 1970s and 1980s additional renovations were made by Jack Steinkampf of Yonkers, New York, particularly in the revoicing of flutes and reeds, and the addition of the Trumpette en Chamade.\\r\\nIn 1993, it was decided that the organs need to undergo major restoration. The first and most essential part of the restoration project was to acquire new consoles for both the Gallery and Chancel Organs to replace the original ones which had deteriorated beyond repair. Twin five-manual consoles were constructed by Robert Turner of Hacienda Heights, California. Solid State Logic, Ltd. of England designed and engineered the combination action. The use of fiber-optic wiring enables both consoles to control the Gallery, Chancel and Nave Organs at the same time. Installation of the Gallery console was finished in time for Christmas Midnight Mass in 1993. The Chancel console was installed in early 1994.\\r\\nFor six weeks in January and February 1994, scaffolding filled the Gallery to provide access for wood craftsmen to begin the arduous process of cleaning, repairing, and oiling the hand-carved organ facade. Meanwhile, the Peragallo Pipe Organ Company of Paterson, New Jersey had been awarded the contract to clean and restore all of the pipework as well as the chests and wind systems. Their first task was to remove all the facade pipes for cleaning and refinishing. It was decided to return the pipework to its original zinc finish, only adding a protective coating to avoid oxidation in the future. After completing work on the facade, Peragallo moved to the interior of the instrument for the purpose of restoring the Great, Choir, Swell, Solo, String and Pedal divisions. The entire Chancel Organ was restored in 1995. Finally, the Echo Organ, situated in the triforium near the center crossing, underwent tonal modifications, making it more useful as the Nave Organ. The organ work was finished in 1997.\\r\\nThe Organs were blessed on September 15, 2007 celebrating the 10th anniversary of their renovations and inaugurating the Bicentennial Concert Series with a performance James E. Goettsche, the Vatican Organist.\\r\\nThe Organs consist of more than 9,000 pipes, 206 stops, 150 ranks and 10 divisions.\\r\\nLocated underneath the high altar is a crypt in which notable Catholic figures that served the Archdiocese are entombed. They include:\\r\\nThe nine past deceased Archbishops of New York:\\r\\nOther interments:\\r\\nIn the above list, Cardinal O'Connor declared Pierre Toussaint and Cardinal Cooke to be servants of God, a step in process of being declared a saint of the Catholic Church. Toussaint was declared venerable in 1996 by Pope John Paul II and Archbishop Sheen was declared venerable by Pope Benedict XVI on June 28, 2012.\\r\\nFour of the Cardinals' galeros (those of Cardinals McCloskey, Farley, Hayes, and Spellman) are located high above the crypt at the back of the sanctuary. Cardinal Spellman's galero was also worn by Pope Pius XII (as Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli) until the latter's election to the papacy at the 1939 Papal conclave. In 1965, the ceremony of the consistory was revised by Pope Paul VI and therefore no galero was presented to Cardinal Cooke or any of his successors.\\r\\nSome notable people whose Requiem Masses were said at the cathedral include New York Yankees greats Babe Ruth, Roger Maris, and Billy Martin; legendary football coach Vince Lombardi, New York City Police Department officer Steven McDonald, singer Celia Cruz, entertainer and host Ed Sullivan, actor and dancer George M. Cohan, former Attorney General and U.S. Senator from New York Robert F. Kennedy, New York Giants owner Wellington Mara, and former Governor of New York Hugh Carey. Special memorial Masses were also held at the cathedral following the deaths of artist Andy Warhol, baseball player Joe DiMaggio, and noted author William F.

Membership of Rajya Sabha is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of 250 members, and current laws have provision for 245 members. Most of the members of the House are indirectly elected by state and territorial legislatures using single transferable votes, while the President can appoint 12 members for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. Members sit for staggered six-year terms, with one third of the members retiring every two years.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rajya Sabha meets in continuous sessions, and unlike the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, is not subject to dissolution. However, the Rajya Sabha, like the Lok Sabha can be prorogued by the President. The Rajya Sabha has equal footing in all areas of legislation with Lok Sabha, except in the area of supply, where the Lok Sabha has overriding powers. In the case of conflicting legislation, a joint sitting of the two houses can be held. However, since the Lok Sabha has twice as many members as the Rajya Sabha, the former would normally hold the greater power. Joint sittings of the Houses of Parliament of India are rare, and in the history of the Republic, only three such joint-sessions have been held; the latest one for the passage of the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vice President of India (currently, Venkaiah Naidu) is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who presides over its sessions. The Deputy Chairman, who is elected from amongst the house's members, takes care of the day-to-day matters of the house in the absence of the Chairman. The Rajya Sabha held its first sitting on 13 May 1952.[5] The salary and other benefits for a member of Rajya Sabha are same as for a member of Lok Sabha.\\r\\n\\r\\nRajya Sabha members are elected by state legislatures rather than directly through the electorate by single transferable vote method. From 18 July 2018, Rajya Sabha MPs can speak in 22 Indian languages in House as the Upper House has facility for simultaneous interpretation in all 22 Indian languages.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle 84 of the Constitution lays down the qualifications for membership of Parliament. A member of the Rajya Sabha must:[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, twelve members are nominated by the President of India having special knowledge in various areas like arts and science. However, they are not entitled to vote in Presidential elections as per Article 55 of the Constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution of India places some restrictions on Rajya Sabha which makes Lok Sabha more powerful in certain areas of comparison.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe definition of a money bill is given in article 110 of constitution of India. A money bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha by a minister and only on recommendation of President of India. When the Lok Sabha passes a money bill then the Lok Sabha sends money bill to the Rajya Sabha for 14 days during which it can make recommendations. Even if Rajya Sabha fails to return the money bill in 14 days to the Lok Sabha, that bill is deemed to have passed by both the Houses. Also, if the Lok Sabha rejects any (or all) of the amendments proposed by the Rajya Sabha, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of Parliament of India in the form the Lok Sabha finally passes it.  This is because the Lok Sabha has largest number of representatives of peoples of India and so the Lok Sabha, the lower house is more powerful in comparison with Rajya Sabha, the upper house. Hence, Rajya Sabha can only give recommendations for a money bill but Rajya Sabha cannot amend a money bill this is to ensure that Rajya Sabha must not add any non money matters in money bill. Lok Sabha can reject all the recommendations of Rajya Sabha or can accept some or all of the recommendations. Decisions of the speaker of the Lok Sabha are final. There is no joint sitting of both the houses with respect to money bills, because all final decisions are taken by the Lok Sabha.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle 108 provides for a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament in certain cases. A joint sitting can be convened by the President of India when one house has either rejected a bill passed by the other house, has not taken any action on a bill transmitted to it by the other house for six months, or has disagreed to the amendments proposed by the Lok Sabha on a bill passed by it. Considering that the numerical strength of Lok Sabha is more than twice that of Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha tends to have a greater influence in a joint sitting of Parliament. A joint session is chaired by the Speaker of Lok Sabha. Also, because the joint session is convened by the President on advice of the government, which already has a majority in Lok Sabha, the joint session is usually convened to get bills passed through a Rajya Sabha in which the government has a minority.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoint sessions of Parliament are a rarity, and have been convened three times in last 71 years, for the purpose of passage of a specific legislative act, the latest time being in 2002:\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the Lok Sabha, a member of the Rajya Sabha cannot bring to the house a no-confidence motion against the government.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Indian federal structure, Rajya Sabha is a representative of the States in the Union legislature (Hence the name, Council of States). Hence, Rajya Sabha is granted powers that protect the rights of States against the Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution empowers Parliament of India to make laws on the matters reserved for States (States List). However, this can only be done if Rajya Sabha first passes a resolution by two-thirds special majority granting such a power to the Union Parliament. The union government cannot make a law on a matter reserved for states without any authorisation from Rajya Sabha.\\r\\n\\r\\nRajya Sabha, by a two-thirds super majority can pass a resolution empowering the Government of India to create more All-India Services common to both Union and States, including a judicial service.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeats are allotted in proportion to the population of people of each state or union territory in such a manner that smaller states have slight advantage over more populous states.[10] As the members are elected by the state legislature, smaller Union Territories which are not States and do not have legislatures cannot have representation in Rajya Sabha. Hence, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Chandigarh, Daman and Diu & Dadra and Nagar Haveli do not send any representatives to Rajya Sabha. 12 members are nominated by the President.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs per the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution of India on 26 January 1950, the Rajya Sabha was to consist of 216 members of which 12 members were to be nominated by the President and the remaining 204 elected to represent the States.[12] The present strength, however, is 245 members of whom 233 are representatives of the states and union territories and 12 are nominated by the President.[12] The 12 nominated members of the Rajya Sabha are persons who are eminent in particular fields, and are well known contributors in the particular field.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of Rajya Sabha by their political party (As of 26 October 2018):[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the Chairman (Vice-President of India) and the Deputy Chairman, there is also a position called Leader of the House.

It is the traditional capital of aNongkhlaw hima (Khasi tribal chieftainship constituting a petty state), both known as Sohra or Churra.\\r\\nCherrapunji has often been credited as being the wettest place on Earth, but for now nearby Mawsynram currently holds that distinction. Cherrapunji still holds the all-time record for the most rainfall in a calendar month and in a year, however: it received 9,300 millimetres (370?in; 30.5?ft) in July 1861 and 26,461 millimetres (1,041.8?in; 86.814?ft) between 1 August 1860 and 31 July 1861.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the Khasi people ÿ native inhabitants of Cherrapunji ÿ may be traced from the early part of the 16th century. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, these people were ruled by their tribal 'Syiems (rajas or chiefs) of Khyriem' in the Khasi Hills. The Khasis hills came under British authority in 1883 with the submission of the last of the important Syiems, Tirot Sing.\\r\\nThe main pivot on which the entire superstructure of Khasi society rests is the matrilineal system.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe original name for this town was Sohra (soh-ra), which was pronounced \\"Churra\\" by the British. This name eventually evolved into the current name, Cherrapunji, meaning 'land of oranges', which was first used by tourists from other parts of India.\\r\\nDespite abundant rainfall, Cherrapunji faces an acute water shortage and the inhabitants often have to trek very long distances to obtain potable water.[2] Irrigation is hampered due to excessive rain washing away the topsoil as a result of human encroachment into the forests.\\r\\nThe Meghalaya state government has renamed Cherrapunji back to its original name, \\"Sohra\\". There is a monument to David Scott (British Administrator in NE India, 1802ÿ31) in the Cherrapunji cemetery.\\r\\nCherrapunji is located at 2518N 9142E? / ?25.30N 91.70E? / 25.30; 91.70.

The plateau rises 600 meters above the surrounding valleys.\\r\\nSoils on the plateau are poor owing to deforestation and washout caused by heavy rainfall. Owing to winter droughts, the vegetation in this location is even xerophytic in spite of the fame of Cherrapunji as an extremely wet place. Additional pressure on local ecosystems is created by the rapid increase of the population  from a Sohra-area population of 7,000 in 1960, it grew to over 100,000 by 2000.[3]\\r\\nValleys around Cherrapunji, however, are covered with lush and very diverse vegetation, containing numerous endemic species of plants, including Meghalaya subtropical forests. Although there is heavy rainfall in Cherrapunji, there is a high scarcity of clean water.\\r\\nThere are some interesting living root briges in Cherrapunjee like the Umshiang root bridge, Mawsaw root bridge, Ritymmen root bridge etc.\\r\\nThe Shillong Plateau is an uplifted horst-like feature, bounded by the E-W Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) to the North, the N-S Jamuna fault in the west, and the NW-SE kopilli fracture zone in the east.\\r\\nSohra or Cherrapunji has a mild subtropical highland climate (K?ppen Cwb), with monsoonal influences typical of India. The city's annual rainfall average stands at 11,777 millimetres (463.7?in).[4] This figure places it behind only nearby Mawsynram, Meghalaya, whose average is 11,873 millimetres (467.4?in). Cherrapunji receives both the southwest and northeast monsoonal winds, giving it a single monsoon season. It lies on the windward side of the Khasi Hills, so the resulting orographic lift enhances precipitation. In the winter months it receives the northeast monsoon showers that travel down the Brahmaputra valley. The driest months are November, December, January and February.\\r\\nTemperatures average 11.5?C (52.7?F) in January and 20.6?C (69.1?F) in August, and the annual mean is 17.3?C (63.1?F)\\r\\nCherrapunji holds two Guinness world records for receiving the maximum amount of rainfall in a single year: 26,471 millimetres (1,042.2?in) of rainfall between August 1860 and July 1861 and for receiving the maximum amount of rainfall in a single month: 9,300 millimetres (370?in) in July 1861.[5]\\r\\nCherrapunji receives rains from the Bay of Bengal arm of the Indian summer monsoon. The monsoon clouds fly unhindered over the plains of Bangladesh for about 400?km. Thereafter, they hit the Khasi Hills which rise abruptly from the plains to a height of about 1,370?m above mean sea level within 2 to 5?km. The geography of the hills with many deep valleys channels encompassing the low-flying (150ÿ300?m) moisture-laden clouds from a wide area converges over Cherrapunji. The winds push the rain clouds through these gorges and up the steep slopes. The rapid ascent of the clouds into the upper atmosphere hastens the cooling and helps vapours to condense. Most of Cherrapunji's rain is the result of air being lifted as a large body of water vapour. The extreme amount of rainfall at Cherrapunji is perhaps the best-known feature of orographic rain in northeast India.\\r\\nOccasionally, cloudbursts can occur in one part of Cherrapunji while other areas may be totally or relatively dry, reflecting the high spatial variability of the rainfall. Atmospheric humidity is extremely high during the peak monsoon period.\\r\\nThe major part of the rainfall at Cherrapunji can be attributed to the orographic features. When the clouds are blown over the hills from the south, they are funneled through the valley. The clouds strike Cherrapunjee perpendicularly and the low flying clouds are pushed up the steep slopes. It is not surprising to find that the heaviest rainfalls occur when the winds blow directly on the Khasi Hills.\\r\\nA notable feature of monsoon rain at Cherrapunji is that most of it falls in the morning. This could be partly due to two air masses coming together. During the monsoon months, the prevailing winds along the Brahmaputra valley generally blow from the east or the northeast, but the winds over Meghalaya are from the south. These two winds systems usually come together in the vicinity of the Khasi Hills. Apparently, the winds that are trapped in the valley at night begin their upward ascent only after they are warmed during the day. This partially explains the frequency of morning rainfall. Apart from orographic features, atmospheric convection plays an important role during the monsoon and the period just preceding it.\\r\\nAs of 2001[update] India census,[8] Cherrapunji had a population of 10,086, with males 48.75% of the total population and females 51.25%. Cherrapunji has an average literacy rate of 74%, higher than the national average of 59.5%, with a male literacy rate of 72.4% and a female one of 73.9%.\\r\\nThe locals living in and around Cherrapunji are known as Khasis. It is a matrilineal culture. After the wedding, the husband of the youngest daughter goes to live with his wife's family, who own the property of the family, while others live on their own getting a bit of the share. The children take on the surname of the mother.[9]\\r\\nCherrapunji is also famous for its living bridges. Over hundreds of years the people in Cherrapunji have developed techniques for growing roots of trees into large bridges. The process takes 10 to 15 years and the bridges typically last hundreds of years, the oldest ones in use being over 500 years old.[10]\\r\\nSohra Government College is the only general degree college in Cherrapunji.\\r\\nCherrapunji has an All India Radio relay station known as Akashvani Cherrapunji. It broadcasts on FM frequencies.","input":"Which is the most rainy place on earth?"},{"output":"a federal republic","context":"The Federal Government of Nigeria is the federal government for the Federal Republic of Nigeria, a federation in West Africa, composed of 36 states, who share sovereignty with the federal government and 1 federal territory administered solely by the federal government. The federal government is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the Constitution of Nigeria in the National Assembly, the President, and the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, respectively.\\r\\nNigeria is a federal republic, with executive power exercised by the president. The president is the head of state, the head of government, and the head of a multi-party system. Nigerian politics takes place within a framework of a federal, presidential, representative democratic republic, in which executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is held by the real government and the two chambers of the legislature: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Together, the two chambers make up the law-making body in Nigeria, called the National Assembly, which serves as a check on the executive arm of government. The highest judiciary arm of government in Nigeria is the Supreme Court of Nigeria which was created after independence and also practices Baron de Montesquieu's theory of the separation of powers[1] based on the United States system and also practises checks and balances[2] The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Nigeria as \\"hybrid regime\\" in 2016.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe law of Nigeria is based on the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, and British common law (due to the long history of British colonial influence). The common law in the legal system is similar to common-law systems used in England and Wales and other Commonwealth countries. The constitutional framework for the legal system is provided by the Constitution of Nigeria.\\r\\nThere is a judicial branch, with the Supreme Court regarded as the highest court of the land.\\r\\nThere is however no lack of rule in this country as it rules over the whole world and is known as \\"The Giant of Africa\\" are[4]\\r\\n(1) Acts of British parliament, popularly referred to as statutes of general application.\\r\\n(2) Local legislation (comprising enactments of the Nigerian legislatures from colonial period to date). There were other sources which though subsumed in Nigerian legislations were distinctly imported into the Nigerian legal systems. They are called the criminal and penal codes of Nigeria.\\r\\nNigerian legislation may be classified as follows. The colonial era until 1960 , post independence legislation 1960-1966 , the military era 1966-1999.\\r\\nThe grant of independence to Nigeria was a milestone in the political history of the country. This period witnessed the consolidation of political gains made during the colonial era. Politicians genuinely focused their lapses in the polity. It achieved for herself a republican status by shaking off the last vestiges of colonial authority. However, despite the violent violation of its provisions, the constitution remained the subsequent administrations (military or otherwise).\\r\\nThe breakdown of law and order which occurred in the period under review would not be attributed to any defect in the Nigerian legal system. Corrupt practices both in the body politic and all aspects of Nigerian life eroded efficiency and progress. There were 8 coups generally five were successful and 3 were unsuccessful.\\r\\nThe president is elected through universal suffrage. He or she is both the chief of state and head of government, heading the Federal Executive Council, or cabinet.\\r\\nThe executive branch is divided into Federal Ministries, each headed by a minister appointed by the president. The president must include at least one member from each of the 36 states in his cabinet. The President's appointments are confirmed by the Senate of Nigeria. In some cases, a federal minister is responsible for more than one ministry (for example, Environment and Housing may be combined), or a minister may be assisted by one or more ministers of State.[5] Each ministry also has a Permanent Secretary, who is a senior civil servant.[6]\\r\\nThe ministries are responsible for various parastatals (government-owned corporations), such as universities, the National Broadcasting Commission, and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. However, some parastatals are the responsibility of the Office of the Presidency, such as the Independent National Electoral Commission, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Federal Civil Service Commission.[7]\\r\\nThe National Assembly of Nigeria has two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House of Representatives is presided over by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. It has 360 members, who are elected for four-year terms in single-seat constituencies. The Senate, which has 109 members, is presided over by the President of the Senate. 108 members are elected for four-year terms in 36 three-seat constituencies, which correspond to the country's 36 states. One member is selected in the single-seat constituency of the federal capital.\\r\\nThe judicial branch consists of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, the Court of Appeals, the High Courts, and other trial courts such as the Magistrates', Customary, Sharia and other specialised courts.[8] The National Judicial Council serves as an independent executive body, insulating the judiciary from the executive arm of government.[9] The Supreme Court is presided over by the Chief Justice of Nigeria and thirteen associate justices, who are appointed by the President of Nigeria on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council. These justices are subject to confirmation by the Senate.\\r\\nNigeria is made up of 36 states and 1 territory. They are: the Federal Capital Territory, Abia, Adamawa, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Benue, Borno, Cross River, Delta, Ebonyi, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Gombe, Imo, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Oyo, Plateau, Rivers, Sokoto, Taraba, Yobe, and Zamfara\\r\\nEach state is further divided into Local Government Areas (LGAs). There are 774 LGAs in Nigeria.[11] Kano State has the largest number of LGAs at 44, and Bayelsa State has the fewest at 9. The Federal Capital Territory of Abuja has 6 LGAs.[11] LGAs replaced the Districts that were the previous third-tier administrative units under the British government.\\r\\nThe military of Nigeria has played a major role in the country's history, often seizing control of the country and ruling it for long periods of time. Its last period of rule ended in 1999, following the death of the leader of the previous military junta Sani Abacha in 1998.\\r\\nActive duty personnel in the three Nigerian armed services totals approximately 76,000. The Nigerian Army, the largest of the services, has about 60,000 personnel, deployed between two mechanized infantry divisions, one composite division (airborne and amphibious), the Lagos Garrison Command (a division-size unit), and the Abuja-based Brigade of Guards. The Nigerian Navy (7,000) is equipped with frigates, fast attack craft, convettes, and coastal patrol boats. The Nigerian Air Force (9,000) flies transports, trainers, helicopters, and fighter aircraft; however, most of their vehicles are currently not operational. Recently, Marshal of the Nigerian Air Force, Sadique Abubakar, suggested the purchase of equipment after dumping the non-operational vehicles.\\r\\nNigeria currently has better foreign relations with its neighbours, due to its current state of democracy. It is a member of the African Union and sits on that organization's Peace and Security Council. In 1960, Nigeria joined both the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations; however, they were briefly suspended between 1995 and 1999.","input":"What type of government system does nigeria have?"},{"output":"The Titan's Curse","context":"Percy Jackson & the Olympians, often shortened to Percy Jackson, is a pentalogy of fantasy adventure novels written by American author Rick Riordan, and the first book series in the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles.[1] Five supplementary books, along with three graphic novels, have also been released. More than 45 million copies of the books have been sold in more than 35 countries.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of October 28, 2011, the series has been on The New York Times Best Seller list for children's book series for 245 weeks.[3] The first book was adapted into a film titled Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief in 2010, which was commercially successful, but received mixed reviews. An adaptation of the second book, titled Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, was released in 2013.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopment for both The Lightning Thief and the Percy Jackson series commenced when Rick Riordan began making stories for his son Haley Riordan, who had at the time been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia.[6] His son, Haley, had been studying Greek mythology in second grade and requested that his father tell him bedtime stories based on Greek myths. When Riordan ran out of myths, his son suggested that he make up new stories using existing mythological characters and new ones. This led Riordan to create the fictional character of Percy Jackson and create the story of how he travels across the United States to recover Zeus's lightning-bolt. Haley suggested that he should turn that story into a book, and Riordan wrote the book over the next year despite being busy at that time.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving his manuscript with his agent and editor for review, Riordan presented the book to a group of 6th, 7th, and 8th graders to read and critique. He gained their approval, and with their help, came up with the name of the book and created the way Percy's sword works.[8] In 2004, the book was sold to Miramax Books for enough money for Riordan to quit his job and focus on writing.[9] After it was released on 28?June 2005, it sold over 1.2?million copies. The book was released in multiple versions, including hardcover, paperback and audio editions.[10][11] It has been translated into multiple languages and published all over the world.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lightning Thief is the first book in the series and was released on July 1, 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a harrowing experience at his school trip, Percy Jackson returns home for the summer vacation, wherein he and his mother Sally Jackson, travel to their cabin in Montauk to take their mind off things. However, the trip is cut short after a series of harrowing incidents, such as being attacked by the Minotaur. Percy finds himself at Camp Half-Blood, a training camp for demigods like him. He discovers that he is a demigod, son of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, earthquakes, and father of all horses, (which he made from sea foam). Percy also learns that his best friend, Grover Underwood, is actually a satyr, and that the Greek gods are accusing Percy of having stolen Zeus' master lightning bolt, the most powerful weapon in the world. To clear his name and save the world from another war between the Olympian gods, Percy sets out to retrieve the lightning bolt from Hades, who is suspected of being the real thief. Thus, Percy, Grover, and Annabeth Chase, a daughter of Athena, start on a journey to the underworld, facing numerous mythological monsters on the way. After confronting an innocent Hades, they learn that their friend Luke Castellan, son of Hermes, is the real thief who stole the bolt to allow Kronos, the defeated king of the Titans, a chance to rise again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book was adapted into a film by Chris Columbus and 20th Century Fox, under the title Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, and was released on February 12, 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sea of Monsters is the second installment in the series, released on April 1, 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nCamp Half-Blood is under attack when Thalia's tree, which guards the borders of the camp, is poisoned and slowly begins to die. In order to save the tree and the camp, someone must recover the Golden Fleece, which is somewhere in the Sea of Monsters. At the same time, Percy finds out that Grover, who has left on a quest to find the missing god Pan, has been captured by the cyclops Polyphemus and that the Fleece is on Polyphemus' island. Together with Annabeth and his half-brother Tyson, a cyclops, Percy sets out to rescue Grover. Meanwhile, Clarisse La Rue, daughter of Ares, is sent on an official quest by Camp Half-Blood to retrieve the Fleece. The trip to the Sea of Monsters is long and hazardous and along the way the heroes encounter several dangers including Scylla and Charybdis, the sorceress Circe, the Sirens and their former friend Luke Castellan. Percy also learns about a prophecy from the Oracle about a child of one of the three most important gods (Zeus, Poseidon and Hades), playing a vital part in the success or failure of the resurrection of Kronos the Titan-King. The heroes eventually retrieve the Fleece and restore Thalia's tree but also unknowingly revive Thalia herself, daughter of Zeus, who had been turned into the tree by her father when she died.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book was adapted into a film by Thor Freudenthal and 20th Century Fox, under the title Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, and was released on August 7, 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Titan's Curse is the third installment in the series.

However, Annabeth falls off a cliff whilst trying to fight the manticore and is said to be captured. Later, Artemis is captured by Luke's army while on the hunt for the Ophiotaurus, a cow-serpent monster that was foretold to bring the downfall of Olympus when its entrails are sacrificed to a fire. Her lieutenant Zoe Nightshade, daughter of Atlas, leads Bianca, Thalia and Grover on a quest to save her. Percy, who was not invited to join the party, follows them on behalf of Nico Di Angelo, promising that he will do his best to protect his sister, Bianca. The others eventually find Percy, and he joins their group. They become the prey of skeletons, who chase them across the country. Bianca is able to kill one, which leaves the others mystified. Bianca later dies as they make their way across a godly junkyard. They find Annabeth with Luke and Artemis, who is holding up the sky. Percy then takes it from Artemis and they trick Atlas into his original position under the sky. Thalia replaces Zoe, who dies, as Artemis' lieutenant. Thalia's induction as a lieutenant of Artemis ensures that she will become immortal, never aging to 16, thus escaping the Great Prophecy and leaving Percy to fulfill it. They return to camp and Percy informs Nico about Bianca's death during the journey. Nico blames Percy for failing to protect her and runs away, only after killing skeletons that invade the camp, so that Percy realizes that Hades is Nico's father.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of the Labyrinth is the fourth installment in the series. It was released on May 6, 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being attacked by monsters, Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood and learns about the Labyrinth. Annabeth and Percy find an entrance into the Labyrinth in camp. Percy soon learns that Luke will use the entrance to lead his army through the Labyrinth straight into the heart of camp. Annabeth is chosen to lead a quest to prevent it, and chooses to bring Tyson, Percy, and Grover, even though it was traditional to bring only two companions on a quest, as explained by Chiron. While in the Labyrinth, Percy and Annabeth become separated from Grover and Tyson. They encounter Nico, who begins to forgive Percy. Percy and Annabeth arrive under Mount St. Helens. Percy accidentally causes St. Helens to erupt and washes ashore on Calypso's island, Ogygia. He returns to Camp Half-Blood, rather than staying with her, stating that \\"she would always be his biggest 'what-if'\\". Then he and Annabeth recruit a mortal girl, Rachel Dare to be a guide in the Labyrinth, using her sight through the Mist, the magical veil that separates the mythological world from the mortal world, and her knowledge for the quest. Daedalus is shown to be alive and to have given Ariadne's string to Luke. They find Grover and Tyson and discover Pan, and Grover tells him that he must return to the world. But Pan says that he cannot come and before dying tells Grover to tell those who will listen that he has died. Grover does what he is told. Percy also finds Luke's body in Kronos' coffin. A final demigod joins the Titans' cause, and Kronos fully rises, using Luke's body. They flee to camp, trying to stop the invasion. Kronos' forces attack the camp, but they are defeated. The book ends with Daedalus sacrificing himself after the battle to destroy the Labyrinth, as it is tied to his life force, and Nico Di Angelo fully forgiving Percy and proposing a dangerous plan for defeating the Titans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Last Olympian, the fifth and final book in the Percy Jackson series, was released on May 5, 2009.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nPercy Jackson learns that Kronos' forces are preparing to attack Olympus. Poseidon, Percy's father, decides that it is time for Percy to now fulfill the Great Prophecy. Seeking to defeat Kronos, like Achilles did, Percy bathes in the River Styx, making his body invulnerable except one small chosen part of his body (the small of his back). Kronos leads a siege of New York City and puts its citizens to sleep. Percy leads the campers, Hunters, nature spirits, and centaurs to protect Mount Olympus from Kronos and his forces. While they protect Olympus, the gods hold down the monster Typhon as he makes his way to New York. Kronos, possessing Luke's body, forces his way into Olympus and battles Percy in Olympus' throne room. Typhon reaches New York but is defeated after the arrival of Poseidon's forces, led by Tyson. Annabeth is able to make Luke come back to his senses, and Percy gives him Annabeth's knife. Luke stabs himself in his mortal spot (as he also was invulnerable from bathing in the River Styx) to destroy Kronos and save Mount Olympus, but Luke dies. The gods reward Percy and his friends, and offer him immortality. He rejects the offer, but instead requests the gods to claim all their children and to have cabins for all the gods, including the minor ones. Rachel Elizabeth Dare becomes the Oracle and recites the next Great Prophecy. The book finishes with Percy and Annabeth becoming a couple, and ominous clouds looming over Rachel's next Great Prophecy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Demigod Files, also written by Rick Riordan, is the first companion book to the series.

At 196 pages, it also contains information on the places and characters of the series, as well as a glossary of Greek myths.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Demigod Diaries contains four new stories with character interviews, illustrations of characters and more, puzzles, and a quiz. The four stories include the adventures of Thalia, Luke, and Annabeth, and others which precede the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series and a first-person narrative from Percy's viewpoint. Set a month after the events of The Last Olympian and before he goes missing in The Lost Hero, Percy and Annabeth retrieve Hermes' stolen staff.\\r\\nOne of the stories is written by Riordan's son, Haley, and revolves around one of the demigods who fought for Kronos during the Second Titan War and survived the battle in Manhattan.\\r\\nAs a part of the spin-off The Heroes of Olympus series, The Demigod Diaries contain a story involving Jason, Leo, and Piper that recounts their time spent at Camp Half-Blood between The Lost Hero and The Son of Neptune.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lightning Thief received mostly positive reviews and won awards including the School Library Journal Best Book of 2005.[21] The New York Times praised The Lightning Thief as perfectly paced, with electrifying moments chasing each other like heartbeats.[22] Author Rick Riordan said of the various awards:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The ultimate compliment for a children's writer is when the kids like it.\\"[23]\\r\\nLike its predecessor, The Sea of Monsters won several prizes and received generally positive reviews as well.[24][25] It sold over 100,000?copies in hardcover by the time it was released in paperback[26] and reviewers have praised the storyline, themes and the author's style of writing.[27][28][29] Matt Berman, of Common Sense Media, praised the book, saying The Percy Jackson series continues to be pure fun, with the author doing nearly everything right to produce a book that few kids will be able to resist.[28] Kirkus reviewed The Battle of the Labyrinth as, This volume can stand alone, but no one will be able to read just one [] look no further for the next Harry Potter, meet Percy Jackson as legions of fans already have. As of February 13, 2016, it has been on the New York Times Children's Series Best Seller List for 379 weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome critics, especially Christian critics of Riordan have disapproved of the emphasis on pagan gods in his books. Riordan responds to these complaints by reminding his readers that first and foremost,[30] \\"The Lightning Thief explores Greek mythology in a modern setting, but it does so as a humorous work of fantasy. Im certainly not interested in changing or contradicting anyones religious beliefs. Early in the book, the character Chiron makes a distinction between God, capital-G, the creator of the universe, and the Greek gods (lower-case g). Chiron says he doesnt want to delve into the issue of God, but he has no qualms about discussing the Olympians because they are a \\"much smaller matter.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics such as The Calico Critic have also disagreed with the fusion of Greek mythology and modern American culture. They have stated that it is difficult to believe \\"the reality of the tale\\", claiming that \\"monsters in the St. Louis Arch\\" and \\"the entrance to Olympus in New York\\" were unimaginable, despite Riordan's explanations of why he chose these certain locations.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever studies show that overall, readers appreciated the mundane language, witty tone and aesthetic plot of the novels, as well as how it introduced Greek mythology to them.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese films have been made from the books:\\r\\n\\r\\nChris Columbus directed and produced Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief for 20th Century Fox through 1492 Pictures.[32][33] The film was released in 2010 in the United States, Canada and in the United Kingdom on February?12 and in Australia on February?11.[34]\\r\\nColumbus has stated that he was drawn to directing the Percy Jackson movie because it gave him the \\"opportunity to do a movie that we haven't really seen before for this generation. When I was a kid, there were movies that dealt with Greek mythology, which in terms of visual effects was really primitive. So I thought this was an opportunity to deal with Greek mythology which children and adults all over the world are fascinated by and it was not a new genre but a new avenue, dealing with mythological creatures in a contemporary setting.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second film in the series, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters,[35][36] was released on August 7, 2013.[5] Filming began in April 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nChris Columbus stated that there will not be a third movie any time soon.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo accompany the film, a video game was produced.

Since his 2006 purchase of Carter Holt Harvey he has focused his acquisitions on the paper packaging sector. His largest acquisition to-date was for Alcoa's Packaging & Consumer group in 2008 for US$2.7bn, later renamed Reynolds Packaging Group.[4] He does not directly manage his businesses, and is focused mostly on the financing related to re-capitalization of the companies.\\r\\nUnlike other LBO investors however, Hart is not a believer of sharing the returns of the company, and does not allow any member of the board to get any share in the equity of the businesses. In this manner, he ensures that the risk and the substantial rewards of an LBO investment remain solely with him.\\r\\nForbes stated that Hart was the 178th richest person in the world as of March 2016.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRank Group Ltd is Graeme Hart's private investment company. It is the 100% owner of Reynolds Consumer Products,[5] Burns Philp and Carter Holt Harvey. Rank had assets of approximately NZ$3bn in cash after selling the assets of Burns Philp and floating Goodman Fielder in 2004.\\r\\nIn December 2006 he agreed to purchase International Paper's drinks packaging business Evergreen Packaging for NZ$725 million. In May 2007 he bought Swiss packaging company SIG for NZ$3.2bn. The SIG division Combibloc is the second largest food and drink carton packaging company in the world after Swedish giant Tetra Laval. In August 2007 Hart completed his US$450M purchase of US paper packaging company Blue Ridge Paper Products of North Carolina which he intends to merge with Evergreen Packaging of Arkansas. These acquisitions make Rank Group the world's second biggest player in the paper products business.[6][7]\\r\\nIn March 2015 Reynolds Group Holdings completed the sale of SIG to Onex Corporation. [8]\\r\\nHart's \\"company vehicle\\" is a Gulfstream G650, registered N946JB.\\r\\nBurns Philp and Company Limited was an Australian and New Zealand food manufacturing company dual listed on the ASX and NZX. Hart has been the chairman since September 2004 and a member of the board of directors since September 1997. In 2003 Burns Philp performed a A$2.4bn hostile takeover of the much larger food group Goodman Fielder before relisting it through an IPO.\\r\\nFollowing the sale of its yeast and spices business to UK firm Associated British Foods, Uncle Toby's to Nestle for NZ$1.1bn and Bluebird Foods to PepsiCo for NZ$245M the company became largely a cashed up shell.\\r\\nIn December 2006, Hart completed a A$1.6bn takeover of the 42 per cent of Burns Philp he did not already own. After the successful takeover Burns Philp was delisted from the ASX and NZX. The deal gave him total control of A$2.9bn of Burns Philp cash, net of debt, which he could then use to further build on his Carter Holt Harvey empire.\\r\\nHart sold Burn Philp's 20% stake in Goodman Fielder for NZ$675.8M in October 2007.[7]\\r\\nIn 2006 Hart paid NZ$3.3bn for Carter Holt Harvey (CHH), a New Zealand timber and paper business. Soon after completing the purchase he began restructuring the struggling company starting with the sale of CHH's forests to US-based Hancock Timber Group for up to NZ$2bn. Hart has also sold CHH's head office property, various sawmills and packaging plants for over NZ$300M.\\r\\nIn 2007 he announced the sale of CHH's building supplies business which some estimate could fetch NZ$2.3bn,[7] but was unsuccessful in the selling of it.\\r\\nHart had also been seeking a purchaser for the packaging side of CHH since October 2010. In April 2014, CHH announced the sale of its Pulp, Paper & Packaging business to a Japanese consortium for NZ$1.037bn, with the deal closing in the 2nd half of 2014.\\r\\nIn 2008 Hart paid US$2.7bn for Alcoa (AA) Packaging & Consumer group. He spun off the company and renamed it Reynolds Packaging Group, which is now headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois, USA. While this business is within the packaging industry, it is not paper packaging related, being mostly in the aluminium foil and plastic closure business. Since the purchase from Alcoa, Hart has cut more than 20% of the workforce within Reynolds, mostly through plant shutdowns, including the flagship Reynolds Wrap Foil Plant in Richmond, Virginia and restructuring efforts. This has resulted in significant savings and profit margin jump for the company, allowing him to issue more debt on behalf of the company in October 2009 and get a high return on his initial investment.[9]\\r\\nIn November 2009 and May 2010, Hart, through additional debt financing has combined the packaging groups he owns into Reynolds Group Holdings Limited. RGHL is the combination of four operating segments: SIG (a beverage packaging manufacturer headquartered in Zurich), Closure Systems International (a plastic bottle cap manufacturer headquartered in Indianapolis), Evergreen Packaging (a beverage packaging manufacturer headquartered in Memphis), and Reynolds Consumer Products(an aluminium foil and other packaging materials manufacturer) located in Lake Forest, Illinois. While the operations are spread around the world, the RGHL corporate headquarters are located in the same office building as Reynolds Consumer Products in Lake Forest, Illinois.\\r\\nOn June 17, 2011, Reynolds Group Holdings announced its intention to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Graham Packaging Company, Inc, headquartered in York, PA. The acquisition was completed on September 8, 2011 for $25.50 per share (in cash), for a total enterprise value, including net debt, of approximately USD$4.5B.[10] This acquisition increased Rank's growing profile in the US. Earlier in 2011, it agreed to buy the automotive consumer business of Honeywell International (the FRAM group) for $950M USD. [11] In March 2015 Reynolds Group Holdings completed the sale of SIG to Onex Corporation. [8]\\r\\nHart worked as a tow-truck driver and as a panel beater after leaving school at 16.\\r\\nIn 1987, Hart completed an MBA from the University of Otago. His research thesis outlines the strategy for Rank, then a small hire company, to evolve into a major corporation.[12] This strategy relies on using the cash flow of well-performing companies to fund debt, which as it gets paid off, increases the equity value of the initial investors, a.k.a. leveraged buyouts.\\r\\nHart gained a big break when he purchased the Government Printing Office for less than its capital value in 1990. The purchase was 1.4x earnings and Hart was provided generous payment terms. Then New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange initially refused to sign off on the transaction. The following year he bought Whitcoulls Group which at that time included a retail chain of bookstores as well as office and stationery concerns. He has since sold off these interests.\\r\\nGraeme Hart has residences in Auckland and on Waiheke Island in New Zealand. He attended Mount Roskill Grammar School. Hart says he lacks interest in making money for its own sake. He describes his personal wealth as a \\"by-product\\" of what he does.\\r\\nWhile he prefers to keep a low profile in the general media he was notable for the launch of his 58 m luxury motor yacht Ulysses at Auckland's Viaduct Harbour in January 2006. The yacht is valued at nearly $100M and took five years to complete due to being gutted by a fire during refit by a New Orleans shipyard. In 2012 it was put up for sale for $49-million. (these details are out of date) Hart has a new yacht under building at Kleven Verft?(nn) in the community of Ulstein in Norway. The yard specialises in off-shore vessels and the 107-meter long yacht is constructed to sail under rough conditions, equipped with helicopter deck, hangar and accommodation for 60 persons.[13][14] Hart's latest 107-metre \\"expedition yacht,\\" named Ulysses, was completed and eventually launched on 3 September 2014, in Ulsteinvik, north of Oslo, at the Kleven Verft shipyard.[15][16]","input":"Who is the richest man in new zealand?"},{"output":"30 April 1975","context":"","input":"When did north vietnam and south vietnam unite?"},{"output":"at the time of conception","context":"Sexual differentiation in humans is the process of development of sex differences in humans. It is defined as the development of phenotypic structures consequent to the action of hormones produced following gonadal determination.[1] Sexual differentiation includes development of different genitalia and the internal genital tracts, breasts, body hair, and plays a role in gender identification.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development of sexual differences begins with the XY sex-determination system that is present in humans, and complex mechanisms are responsible for the development of the phenotypic differences between male and female humans from an undifferentiated zygote.[3] Females have two X chromosomes, and males have a Y chromosome and an X chromosome. At an early stage in embryonic development, both sexes possess equivalent internal structures. These are the mesonephric ducts and paramesonephric ducts. The presence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome causes the development of the testes in males, and the subsequent release of hormones which cause the paramesonephric ducts to regress. In females, the mesonephric ducts regress.\\r\\n\\r\\nDivergent sexual development, also known as intersexuality, can be a result of genetic and hormonal factors.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nA babys sex is determined at the time of conception. When the baby is conceived, a chromosome from the sperm cell, either X or Y, fuses with the X chromosome in the egg cell, determining whether the baby will be female (XX) or male (XY).[5] To be female, one needs to be (XX), whereas to be a male, (XY) is needed.  It is the Y chromosome that is essential for the development of the male reproductive organs, and with no Y chromosome, an embryo will develop into a female. This is because of the presence of the sex determining region of the Y chromosome, also known as the SRY gene.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nA fetus doesn't develop its external sexual organs until the second month of pregnancyseven weeks after conception. The fetus appears to be sexually indifferent, looking neither like a male or a female.  Over the next five weeks, the fetus begins producing hormones that cause its sex organs to grow into either male or female organs. This process is called sexual differentiation. The precursor of the internal female sex organs is called the Mllerian system.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 7 weeks, a fetus has a genital tubercle, urogenital groove and sinus, and labioscrotal folds. In females, without excess androgens, these become the clitoris, urethra and vagina, and labia\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferentiation between the sexes of the sex organs occurs throughout embryological, fetal and later life. This includes both internal and external genital differentiation. In both males and females, the sex organs consist of three structures: the gonads, the internal genitalia, and the external genitalia.  In males, the gonads are the testes and in females they are the ovaries.  These are the organs that produce gametes (egg and sperm), the reproductive cells that will eventually meet to form the fertilized egg (zygote).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the zygote divides, it first becomes the embryo (which means 'growing within'), typically between zero and eight weeks, then from the eighth week until birth, it is considered the fetus (which means 'unborn offspring').   The internal genitalia are all the accessory glands and ducts that connect the gonads to the outside environment.  The external genitalia consist of all the external reproductive structures. The sex of an early embryo cannot be determined because the reproductive structures do not differentiate until the seventh week.  Prior to this, the child is considered bipotential because it cannot be identified as male or female.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe internal genitalia consist of two accessory ducts: mesonephric ducts (male) and paramesonephric ducts (female). The mesonephric system is the precursor to the male genitalia and the paramesonephric  to the female reproductive system.[8] As development proceeds, one of the pairs of ducts develops while the other regresses.  This depends on the presence or absence of the sex determining region of the Y chromosome, also known as the SRY gene.[6]  In the presence of a functional SRY gene, the bipotential gonads develop into testes. Gonads are histologically distinguishable by 6ÿ8 weeks of gestation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent development of one set and degeneration of the other depends on the presence or absence of two testicular hormones: testosterone and anti-mllerian hormone (AMH).  Disruption of typical development may result in the development of both, or neither, duct system, which may produce morphologically intersex individuals.\\r\\n\\r\\nMales: The SRY gene when transcribed and processed produces SRY protein that binds to DNA and directs the development of the gonad into testes.   Male development can only occur when the fetal testis secretes key hormones at a critical period in early gestation. The testes begin to secrete three hormones that influence the male internal and external genitalia: they secrete anti-mllerian hormone (AMH),  testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Anti-mllerian hormone causes the paramesonephric ducts to regress.  Testosterone converts the mesonephric ducts into male accessory structures, including the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicle.   Testosterone will also control the descending of the testes from the abdomen into the scrotum.[1] Many other genes found on other autosomes, includingWT-1, SOX9, SF-1 also play a role in gonadal development.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFemales: Without testosterone and AMH, the mesonephric ducts degenerate and disappear. The paramesonephric ducts develop into a uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina.[5] There still remains a broad lack of information about the genetic controls of female development, and much remains unknown about the female embryonic process.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nMales become externally distinct between 8 and 12 weeks, as androgens enlarge the phallus and cause the urogenital groove and sinus to fuse in the midline, producing an unambiguous penis with a phallic urethra, and a thinned, rugated scrotum. \\r\\nDihydrotestosterone will differentiate the remaining male characteristics of  the external genitalia.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nA sufficient amount of any androgen can cause external masculinization. The most potent is dihydrotestosterone (DHT), generated from testosterone in skin and genital tissue by the action of 5ϫ-reductase. A male fetus may be incompletely masculinized if this enzyme is deficient. In some diseases and circumstances, other androgens may be present in high enough concentrations to cause partial or (rarely) complete masculinization of the external genitalia of a genetically female fetus. The testes begin to secrete three hormones that influence the male internal and external genitalia.  They secrete anti-mllerian hormone, testosterone, and Dihydrotestosterone.  anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH) causes the paramesonephric ducts to regress.  Testosterone, which is secreted and converts the mesonephric ducts into male accessory structures, such as epididymis, vas deferens and seminal vesicle.   Testosterone will also control the descending of the testes from the abdomen into the scrotom.  Dihydrotestosterone, also known as (DHT) will differentiate the remaining male characteristics of  the external genitalia.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther sex differentiation of the external genitalia occurs at puberty, when androgen levels again become disparate. Male levels of testosterone directly induce growth of the penis, and indirectly (via DHT) the prostate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlfred Jost observed that while testosterone was required for mesonephric duct development, the regression of the paramesonephric duct was due to another substance. This was later determined to be paramesonephric inhibiting substance (MIS), a 140 kD dimeric glycoprotein that is produced by sertoli cells. MIS blocks the development of paramesonephric ducts, promoting their regression.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nVisible differentiation occurs at puberty, when estradiol and other hormones cause breasts to develop in typical females.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman adults and children show many psychological and behavioral sex differences. Some (e.g., dress) are learned and obviously cultural. Others are demonstrable across cultures and have both biological and learned determinants. For example, some studies claim girls are, on average, more verbally fluent than boys, but boys are, on average, better at spatial calculation.[12][13] Some have observed that this may be due to two different patterns in parental communication with infants, noting that parents are more likely to talk to girls and more likely to engage in physical play with boys.[9] Because people cannot explore hormonal influences on human behavior experimentally, the relative contributions of biological factors and learning to human psychological and behavioral sex differences (especially gender identity, role, and sexual orientation) are controversial (and hotly contested).[9][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent theories on mechanisms of sexual differentiation of brains and behavior in humans are based primarily on three sources of evidence: animal research involving manipulation of hormones in early life, observation of outcomes of small numbers of individuals with disorders of sexual development (intersex conditions or cases of early sex reassignment), and statistical distribution of traits in populations (e.g., rates of homosexuality in twins). Many of these cases suggest some genetic or hormonal effect on sex differentiation of behavior and mental traits[16] this has been disputed as poor interpretation of scientific methodology.[9][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following variations are associated with atypical determination and differentiation process:[17]","input":"When did you become genetically male or female?"},{"output":"Jon Amiel","context":"Tandoori Nights was a television sitcom broadcast on Channel 4 between 1985 and 1987.

It is based on the memoir of Maria von Trapp, The Story of the Trapp Family Singers. Set in Austria on the eve of the Anschluss in 1938, the musical tells the story of Maria, who takes a job as governess to a large family while she decides whether to become a nun. She falls in love with the children, and eventually their widowed father, Captain von Trapp. He is ordered to accept a commission in the German navy, but he opposes the Nazis. He and Maria decide on a plan to flee Austria with the children. Many songs from the musical have become standards, such as \\"Edelweiss\\", \\"My Favorite Things\\", \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\", \\"Do-Re-Mi\\", and the title song \\"The Sound of Music\\".\\r\\nThe original Broadway production, starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, opened in 1959[1] and won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical, out of nine nominations. The first London production opened at the Palace Theatre in 1961. The show has enjoyed numerous productions and revivals since then. It was adapted as a 1965 film musical starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, which won five Academy Awards. The Sound of Music was the last musical written by Rodgers and Hammerstein; Oscar Hammerstein died of cancer nine months after the Broadway premiere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter viewing The Trapp Family, a 1956 West German film about the von Trapp family, and its 1958 sequel (Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika), stage director Vincent J. Donehue thought that the project would be perfect for his friend Mary Martin; Broadway producers Leland Hayward and Richard Halliday (Martin's husband) agreed.[2] The producers originally envisioned a non-musical play that would be written by Lindsay and Crouse and that would feature songs from the repertoire of the Trapp Family Singers. Then they decided to add an original song or two, perhaps by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But it was soon agreed that the project should feature all new songs and be a musical rather than a play.[3]\\r\\nDetails of the history of the von Trapp family were altered for the musical. The real Georg von Trapp did live with his family in a villa in Aigen, a suburb of Salzburg. He wrote to the Nonnberg Abbey in 1926 asking for a nun to help tutor his sick daughter, and the Mother Abbess sent Maria. His wife had died in 1922. The real Maria and Georg married at the Nonnberg Abbey in 1927. Lindsay and Crouse altered the story so that Maria was governess to all of the children, whose names and ages were changed, as was Maria's original surname (the show used \\"Rainer\\" instead of \\"Kutschera\\"). The von Trapps spent some years in Austria after Maria and the Captain married and was offered a commission in Germany's navy. Since von Trapp opposed the Nazis by that time, the family left Austria after the Anschluss, going by train to Italy and then traveling on to London and the United States.[4] To make the story more dramatic, Lindsay and Crouse had the family, soon after Maria's and the Captain's wedding, escape over the mountains to Switzerland on foot.\\r\\nIn Salzburg, Austria, just before World War II, nuns from Nonnberg Abbey sing the Dixit Dominus. One of the postulants, Maria Rainer, is on the nearby mountainside, regretting leaving the beautiful hills (\\"The Sound of Music\\") where she was brought up. She returns late. The Mother Abbess and the other nuns consider what to do about her (\\"Maria\\"). Maria explains her lateness, saying she was raised on that mountain, and apologizes for singing in the garden without permission. The Mother Abbess joins her in song (\\"My Favorite Things\\").[5] The Mother Abbess tells her that she should spend some time outside the abbey to decide whether she is ready for the monastic life. She will act as the governess to the seven children of a widower, Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine Captain Georg von Trapp.\\r\\nMaria arrives at the villa of Captain von Trapp. He explains her duties and summons the children with a boatswain's call. They march in, clad in uniforms. He teaches her their individual signals on the call, but she openly disapproves of this militaristic approach. Alone with them, she breaks through their wariness and teaches them the basics of music (\\"Do-Re-Mi\\").\\r\\nRolf, a young messenger, delivers a telegram and then meets with the oldest child, Liesl, outside the villa. He claims he knows what is right for her because he is a year older than she (\\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\"). They kiss, and he runs off, leaving her squealing with joy. Meanwhile, the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, gives Maria material to make new clothes, as Maria had given all her possessions to the poor. Maria sees Liesl slipping in through the window, wet from a sudden thunderstorm, but agrees to keep her secret. The other children are frightened by the storm. Maria sings \\"The Lonely Goatherd\\" to distract them.\\r\\nCaptain von Trapp arrives a month later from Vienna with Baroness Elsa Schr?der and Max Detweiler. Elsa tells Max that something is preventing the Captain from marrying her. He opines that only poor people have the time for great romances (\\"How Can Love Survive\\"). Rolf enters, looking for Liesl, and greets them with \\"Heil\\". The Captain orders him away, saying that he is Austrian, not German. Maria and the children leapfrog in, wearing play-clothes that she made from the old drapes in her room. Infuriated, the Captain sends them off to change. She tells him that they need him to love them, and he angrily orders her back to the abbey. As she apologizes, they hear the children singing \\"The Sound of Music\\", which she had taught them, to welcome Elsa Schr?der. He joins in and embraces them. Alone with Maria, he asks her to stay, thanking her for bringing music back into his house. Elsa is suspicious of her until she explains that she will be returning to the abbey in September.\\r\\nThe Captain gives a party to introduce Elsa, and guests argue over the Anschluss. Kurt asks Maria to teach him to dance the L?ndler. When he fails to negotiate a complicated figure, the Captain steps in to demonstrate. He and Maria dance until they come face-to-face; and she breaks away, embarrassed and confused. Discussing the expected marriage between Elsa and the Captain, Brigitta tells Maria that she thinks Maria and the Captain are really in love with each other. Elsa asks the Captain to allow the children to say goodnight to the guests with a song, \\"So Long, Farewell\\". Max is amazed at their talent and wants them for the Kaltzberg Festival, which he is organizing. The guests leave for the dining room, and Maria slips out the front door with her luggage.\\r\\nAt the abbey, Maria says that she is ready to take her monastic vows; but the Mother Abbess realizes that she is running away from her feelings. She tells her to face the Captain and discover if they love each other, and tells her to search for and find the life she was meant to live (\\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\").\\r\\nMax teaches the children how to sing on stage. When the Captain tries to lead them, they complain that he is not doing it as Maria did. He tells them that he has asked Elsa to marry him. They try to cheer themselves up by singing \\"My Favorite Things\\" but are unsuccessful until they hear Maria singing on her way to rejoin them. Learning of the wedding plans, she decides to stay only until the Captain can arrange for another governess. Max and Elsa argue with him about the imminent Anschluss, trying to convince him that it is inevitable (\\"No Way to Stop It\\"). When he refuses to compromise, Elsa breaks off the engagement. Alone, the Captain and Maria finally admit their love, desiring only to be \\"An Ordinary Couple\\". As they marry, the nuns reprise \\"Maria\\" against the wedding processional.\\r\\nDuring the honeymoon, Max prepares the children to perform at the Kaltzberg Festival. Herr Zeller, the Gauleiter, demands to know why they are not flying the flag of the Third Reich now that the Anschluss has occurred. The Captain and Maria return early from their honeymoon before the Festival. In view of developments, he refuses to allow the children to sing. Max argues that they would sing for Austria, but the Captain points out that it no longer exists. Maria and Liesl discuss romantic love; Maria predicts that in a few years Liesl will be married (\\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen (Reprise)\\"). Rolf enters with a telegram that offers the Captain a commission in the German Navy, and Liesl is upset to discover that Rolf is now a committed Nazi. The Captain consults Maria and decides that they must secretly flee Austria. German Admiral von Schreiber arrives to find out why Captain von Trapp has not answered the telegram. He explains that the German Navy holds him in high regard, offers him the commission, and tells him to report immediately to Bremerhaven to assume command. Maria says that he cannot leave immediately, as they are all singing in the Festival concert; and the Admiral agrees to wait.\\r\\nAt the concert, after the von Trapps sing an elaborate reprise of \\"Do-Re-Mi\\", Max brings out the Captain's guitar. Captain von Trapp sings \\"Edelweiss\\", as a goodbye to his homeland, while using Austria's national flower as a symbol to declare his loyalty to the country. Max asks for an encore and announces that this is the von Trapp family's last chance to sing together, as the honor guard waits to escort the Captain to his new command. While the judges decide on the prizes, the von Trapps sing \\"So Long, Farewell\\", leaving the stage in small groups. Max then announces the runners-up, stalling as much as possible. When he announces that the first prize goes to the von Trapps and they do not appear, the Nazis start a search. The family hides at the Abbey, and Sister Margaretta tells them that the borders have been closed. Rolf comes upon them and calls his lieutenant, but after seeing Liesl he changes his mind and tells him they aren't there. The Nazis leave, and the von Trapps flee over the Alps as the nuns reprise \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\".\\r\\nSources: IBDB and Guidetomusicaltheatre.com[8]\\r\\nThe Sound of Music opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on November 16, 1959, moved to the Mark Hellinger Theatre on November 6, 1962, and closed on June 15, 1963, after 1,443 performances.

Other awards included Martin for Best Actress in a Musical, Neway for Best Featured Actress, Best Scenic Design (Oliver Smith) and Best Conductor And Musical Director (Frederick Dvonch). Bikel and Kasznar were nominated for acting awards, and Donehue was nominated for his direction. The entire children's cast was nominated for Best Featured Actress category as a single nominee, even though two of the children were boys.[10]\\r\\nMartha Wright replaced Martin in the role of Maria on Broadway in October 1961, followed by Karen Gantz in July 1962, Jeannie Carson in August 1962[11] and Nancy Dussault in September 1962. Jon Voight, who eventually married co-star Lauri Peters, was a replacement for Rolf. The national tour starred Florence Henderson as Maria and Beatrice Krebs as Mother Abbess. It opened at the Grand Riviera Theater, Detroit, on February 27, 1961, and closed November 23, 1963, at the O'Keefe Centre, Toronto. Henderson was succeeded by Barbara Meister in June 1962. Theodore Bikel was not satisfied playing the role of the Captain, because of the role's limited singing,[citation needed] and Bikel did not like to play the same role over and over again. In his autobiography, he writes: \\"I promised myself then that if I could afford it, I would never do a run as long as that again.\\"[12] The original Broadway cast album sold three million copies.\\r\\nThe musical premiered in London's West End at the Palace Theatre on May 18, 1961, and ran for 2,385 performances.

The cast included Jean Bayless as Maria, followed by Sonia Rees, Roger Dann as Captain von Trapp, Constance Shacklock as Mother Abbess, Eunice Gayson as Elsa Schrader, Harold Kasket as Max Detweiler, Barbara Brown as Liesl, Nicholas Bennett as Rolf and Olive Gilbert as Sister Margaretta.[13]\\r\\nIn 1981, at producer Ross Taylor's urging, Petula Clark agreed to star in a revival of the show at the Apollo Victoria Theatre in London's West End. Michael Jayston played Captain von Trapp, Honor Blackman was the Baroness and June Bronhill the Mother Abbess. Other notable cast members included Helen Anker, John Bennett and Martina Grant.[14] Despite her misgivings that, at age 49, she was too old to play the role convincingly, Clark opened to unanimous rave reviews and the largest advance sale in the history of British theatre at that time. Maria von Trapp, who attended the opening night performance, described Clark as \\"the best\\" Maria ever. Clark extended her initial six-month contract to thirteen months. Playing to 101 percent of seating capacity, the show set the highest attendance figure for a single week (October 26ÿ31, 1981) of any British musical production in history (as recorded in The Guinness Book of Theatre).[15] It was the first stage production to incorporate the two additional songs (\\"Something Good\\" and \\"I Have Confidence\\") that Richard Rodgers composed for the film version.[16] \\"My Favorite Things\\" had a similar context to the film version, while the short verse \\"A Bell is No Bell\\" was extended into a full-length song for Maria and the Mother Abbess. \\"The Lonely Goatherd\\" was set in a new scene at a village fair.\\r\\nThe cast recording of this production was the first to be recorded digitally. It was released on CD for the first time in 2010 by the UK label Pet Sounds and included two bonus tracks from the original single issued by Epic to promote the production.\\r\\nDirector Susan H. Schulman staged the first Broadway revival of The Sound of Music, with Rebecca Luker as Maria and Michael Siberry as Captain von Trapp. It also featured Patti Cohenour as Mother Abbess, Jan Maxwell as Elsa Schrader, Fred Applegate as Max Detweiler, Dashiell Eaves as Rolf, Patricia Conolly as Frau Schmidt and Laura Benanti, in her Broadway debut, as Luker's understudy. Later, Luker and Siberry were replaced by Richard Chamberlain as the Captain and Benanti as Maria. Lou Taylor Pucci made his Broadway debut as the understudy for Kurt von Trapp. The production opened on March 12, 1998, at the Martin Beck Theatre, and closed on June 20, 1999, after 533 performances.

Following failed negotiations with Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson,[18] the role of Maria was cast through a UK talent search reality TV show called How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria? The talent show was produced by (and starred) Andrew Lloyd Webber and featured presenter/comedian Graham Norton and a judging panel of David Ian, John Barrowman and Zoe Tyler.\\r\\nConnie Fisher was selected by public voting as the winner of the show. In early 2007, Fisher suffered from a heavy cold that prevented her from performing for two weeks. To prevent further disruptions, an alternate Maria, Aoife Mulholland, a fellow contestant on How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?, played Maria on Monday evenings and Wednesday matinee performances. Simon Shepherd was originally cast as Captain von Trapp, but after two preview performances he was withdrawn from the production, and Alexander Hanson moved into the role in time for the official opening date along with Lesley Garrett as the Mother Abbess. After Garrett left, Margaret Preece took the role. The cast also featured Lauren Ward as the Baroness, Ian Gelder as Max, Sophie Bould as Liesl, and Neil McDermott as Rolf. Other notable replacements have included Simon Burke and Simon MacCorkindale as the Captain and newcomer Amy Lennox as Liesl. Summer Strallen replaced Fisher in February 2008, [19] with Mulholland portraying Maria on Monday evenings and Wednesday matinees.[20]\\r\\nThe revival received enthusiastic reviews, especially for Fisher, Preece, Bould and Garrett. A cast recording of the London Palladium cast was released.[21] The production closed on February 21, 2009, after a run of over two years[22] and was followed by a UK national tour, described below.\\r\\nThe first Australian production opened at Melbourne's Princess Theatre in 1961 and ran for three years. The production was directed by Charles Hickman, with musical numbers staged by Ernest Parham. The cast included June Bronhill as Maria, Peter Graves as Captain von Trapp and Rosina Raisbeck as Mother Abbess. A touring company then played for years, with Vanessa Lee (Graves' wife) in the role of Maria. The cast recording made in 1961 was the first time a major overseas production featuring Australian artists was transferred to disc.[citation needed]\\r\\nA Puerto Rican production, performed in English, opened at the Tapia Theatre in San Juan under the direction of Pablo Cabrera in 1966. It starred Camille Carri܇n as Mara and Ra~l Dvila as Captain Von Trapp, and it featured a young Johanna Rosaly as Liesl. In 1968, the production transferred to the Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid, Spain, where it was performed in Spanish with Carri܇n reprising the role of Mara, Alfredo Mayo as Captain Von Trapp and Roberto Rey as Max.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1988, the Moon Troupe of Takarazuka Revue performed the musical at the Bow Hall (Takarazuka, Hygo).

It starred Kara Tointon as Maria, Julian Ovenden as Captain von Trapp, Katherine Kelly as Baroness Schraeder and Alexander Armstrong as Max.[64]\\r\\nMost reviews of the original Broadway production were favorable. Richard Watts, Jr. of the New York Post stated that the show had \\"strangely gentle charm that is wonderfully endearing. The Sound of Music strives for nothing in the way of smash effects, substituting instead a kind of gracious and unpretentious simplicity.\\"[65] The New York World-Telegram and Sun pronounced The Sound of Music \\"the loveliest musical imaginable. It places Rodgers and Hammerstein back in top form as melodist and lyricist. The Lindsay-Crouse dialogue is vibrant and amusing in a plot that rises to genuine excitement.\\"[65] The New York Journal American's review opined that The Sound of Music is \\"the most mature product of the team ... it seemed to me to be the full ripening of these two extraordinary talents\\".[65]\\r\\nBrooks Atkinson of The New York Times gave a mixed assessment. He praised Mary Martin's performance, saying \\"she still has the same common touch ... same sharp features, goodwill, and glowing personality that makes music sound intimate and familiar\\" and stated that \\"the best of the Sound of Music is Rodgers and Hammerstein in good form\\". However, he said, the libretto \\"has the hackneyed look of the musical theatre replaced with Oklahoma! in 1943. It is disappointing to see the American musical stage succumbing to the clichs of operetta.\\"[65] Walter Kerr's review in the New York Herald Tribune was unfavorable: \\"Before The Sound of Music is halfway through its promising chores it becomes not only too sweet for words but almost too sweet for music\\", stating that the \\"evening suffer(s) from little children\\".[65]\\r\\nColumbia Masterworks recorded the original Broadway cast album a week after the show's 1959 opening. The album was the label's first deluxe package in a gatefold jacket, priced $1 higher than previous cast albums. It was #1 on Billboard's best-selling albums chart for 16 weeks in 1960.[66] It was released on CD from Sony in the Columbia Broadway Masterworks series.[67] In 1959, singer Patti Page recorded the title song from the show for Mercury Records[68] on the day that the musical opened on Broadway. Since it was recorded a week before the original Broadway cast album, Page was the first artist to record any song from the musical. She featured the song on her TV show, The Patti Page Olds Show, helping to popularize the musical.[citation needed] The 1960 London production was recorded by EMI and was issued on CD on the Broadway Angel Label.[69]\\r\\nThe 1965 film soundtrack was released by RCA Victor and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide.[70][71] Recent CD editions incorporate musical material from the film that would not fit on the original LP. The label has also issued the soundtrack in German, Italian, Spanish and French editions.[citation needed] RCA Victor also released an album of the 1998 Broadway revival produced by Hallmark Entertainment and featuring the full revival cast, including Rebecca Luker, Michael Siberry, Jan Maxwell and Fred Applegate.[72] The Telarc label made a studio cast recording of The Sound of Music, with the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra conducted by Erich Kunzel (1987).

It is located at 907 Whitehead Street, across from the Key West lighthouse, close to the Southern coast of the island. On November 24, 1968, it was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was Hemingway's home from 1931 to 1939, although he retained title to the home until he died.[1] It is a private, for-profit landmark and tourist attraction now populated by six- and seven-toed cats that are descendants of Hemingway's cats. The author's second son, Patrick, who lived in the house, stated in a 1994 interview in The Miami Herald's \\"Tropic\\" that his father had peacocks in Key West and that he owned cats in Cuba. However, a photo on display at the Hemingway Home in Key West shows Patrick and his younger brother, Gregory, in front of the Cuban water jar near the swimming pool, and Gregory is holding a white cat named Snow White. In addition to the photo showing Patrick and Gregory with Snow White, Hemingway's wife, Pauline, wrote the following in a January 22, 1937, letter to Hemingway (who was staying at the Barclay's Hotel in New York City):\\r\\nSnow White has become his (G's) fox fur that walks. Esther is having the same old cat looing troubles, with discussed alternatives of 1) getting little female, 2) letting him out and NOT worrying, which turns into letting him out and worrying, 3) castrating, 4) putting ad in paper asking for return of brown, blue-eyed cat with reward.[citation needed]\\r\\nDescendants of Hemingway's original cats continue to live on the premises. In 2009, the cats became the subject of federal litigation after a museum visitor expressed concern about the cats' welfare. United States Department of Agriculture investigators visited the museum and subsequently ordered the museum to take measures to tag the cats for identification and to shelter them.[4] The museum fought the regulations in court but lost their case in the court of appeals, which ruled that the cats \\"substantially affect\\" interstate commerce and thus are protected by the Animal Welfare Act of 1966.[5] The house does not sell cats but does continue a selective breeding program for them.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt was in this house that Hemingway wrote some of his best work, including the short story classics \\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\\" and \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\", his novel To Have And Have Not, and the non-fiction work Green Hills of Africa.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe house stands at an elevation of 16 feet (4.9?m) above sea level but is still the second-highest site on the island. It was originally built in 1851 by Asa Tift, a marine architect and salvage wrecker, in a French Colonial estate style,[6] out of limestone quarried from the site. As testament to its construction and location, it survived many hurricanes, and the deep basement remained, and still remains, dry.[7] Before Hurricane Irma struck the Florida Keys in September 2017, the entire population of the island chain were ordered to evacuate by the federal government, but the museum's curator, general manager and a team of Hemingway Home employees declined to leave the house or evacuate its cats. Several Hemingway Home employees stayed with the cats and the house. They all survived the storm intact.[8]\\r\\nThe Hemingways had spent the previous three years living in Key West but had rented housing, the last being a two-story home at 1301 Whitehead Street.[9][10] Pauline (the writer's second wife) found the Tift house for sale at a tax auction in 1931. Pauline's Uncle Gus bought it for her and Ernest, for $8,000 cash, and presented it to them as a wedding gift.[11]\\r\\nThe house was one of the first on the island to be fitted with indoor plumbing and the first on the island to have an upstairs bathroom with running water, fed from a rain cistern on the roof. Also notable are a built-in fireplace and the first swimming pool in Key West, which was the only pool within 100 miles (160?km) in the late 30s. In November 1936, in an interview with the Key West Citizen, Hemingway showed the reporter the location he had planned for a pool. It was Pauline Hemingway, though, who spent $20,000 (equivalent in 2013 to $330,000) to have the deep well-fed pool built for her husband while he was away as a Spanish Civil War correspondent in 1938. When Hemingway returned, he was unpleasantly surprised by the cost and exclaimed, \\"Well, you might as well have my last cent.\\" This penny is embedded in concrete today near the pool.[9]\\r\\nIn 1937, when Ernest was in Spain, Pauline hired Ernest's friend, driver, and handyman, Toby Bruce, to build the high brick wall that surrounds the house today.[12]\\r\\nAnother of Hemingway's loves was boxing. He set up a ring in his yard and paid local fighters to box with him. He also refereed matches at Blue Heaven, then a saloon but now a restaurant, at 769 Thomas Street.[citation needed]\\r\\nHemingway converted a urinal obtained after a renovation at Sloppy Joe's bar into a water fountain in the yard, where it remains a prominent feature at the home, filled with water from the large Cuban jar and serving as one of many water sources for the grounds' cats.[1] The grounds of the house are maintained as a garden, with many tropical plants installed after Hemingway moved to Cuba. In Hemingway's time, the grounds, like the island, were sparse and dry due to lack of water that only came later, with the Navy's installation of a water line from mainland.\\r\\nThe house was originally purchased for $8,000. After Hemingway's death in 1961, the house was sold by his widow, Mary, to Mrs. Bernice Dickson, the founder of the museum. A prominent feature of the dining room is a Murano glass chandelier. Upstairs, a book display shows books owned by Hemingway while he lived in Key Westincluding Red Pete the Ruthless by C. M. Bennett. Clearly visible is the inscription, \\"Given to Hemingway1936,\\" from Sister Ida, a nun at the local St. Joseph's convent. His writer's studio in the second floor of a free-standing carriage house, and where he stayed briefly (in the 1950s) when visiting from his home in Cuba, was once connected by a second story walkway to the master bedroom. The walkway, shown in pictures from archives, has not been reconstructed.\\r\\nA garage on the property, with a caretaker's apartment on the second floor, was built to house Ernest's Buick automobile.\\r\\nIn 1988, the house was a filming location of the 16th James Bond movie Licence to Kill. In the scene, Bond resigns from the secret service and then flees through the garden.

It is customary in many cities and towns in Spain; the largest one takes place in Alicante, where it is the most important festival in the city. The biggest celebration in Portugal is held in Oporto, where it is known as the Festa de S?o Jo?o do Porto. In South America (former Iberian colonies), the biggest celebration takes place in the northeastern states of Brazil, where it is known as Festa Junina.\\r\\nThe bonfires are particularly popular in many Catalan-speaking areas like Catalonia and the Valencian Community, and for this reason some Catalan nationalists regard 24 June as the Catalan nation day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe festivals of Midsummer's Eve (St. John's Eve among Christians) have roots in ancient celebrations related to the summer solstice. Bonfires were lit to protect against evil spirits which were believed to roam freely when the sun was turning southward again.[citation needed] In later years, witches were also thought to be on their way to meetings with other powerful beings.[citation needed]\\r\\nFire features in many of the celebrations, with people gathering together and creating large bonfires from any kind of wood, such as old furniture, and sharing food and drinks while teens and children jump over the fires. In some areas,[where?] bonfires are traditionally named tequeos, which means people of the dance. Parties are often organized at beaches, where bonfires are lit and a set of firework displays usually take place. On the Spanish Mediterranean coast, especially in Catalonia and Valencia, special foods such as coca de Sant Joan are also served on this occasion. In Alicante, since 1928, the bonfires of Saint John were developed into elaborate constructions inspired by the Falles, or Fallas, of Valencia.\\r\\nMidsummer tradition is also especially strong in northern areas of Spain, such as Galicia, Asturias and Cantabria where one can easily identify the rituals that reveal the pagan beliefs widespread throughout Europe in Neolithic times. These beliefs pivot on three basic ideas: the importance of medicinal plants, especially in relation to health, youth and beauty; the protective character of fire to ward men off evil spirits and witches and, finally, the purifying, miraculous effects of water.[citation needed] What follows is a summary of Galician traditions surrounding St. John's festival in relation to these three elements.\\r\\nBefore 1928, the bonfires of Saint John had been celebrated in Alicante as it had been elsewhere in Europe: by burning old pieces of furniture on the night of Saint John on 24 June. The Bonfires festival in Alicante originated in 1928. Jose Mara Py, the founder of the festival, felt that Alicante needed an important fiesta, and came up with an idea to combine bonfires with a Valencian tradition known as the \\"falles\\". The festival ultimately became the most important cultural event in Alicantinian society.\\r\\n19 June\\r\\n19ÿ24 June\\r\\n21 June\\r\\n22 June\\r\\nIn the three parades, people wear the traditional garments from Alicante, and, in the Flower Offering, women wear mantilla and they have a bunch of flowers.\\r\\n23 June\\r\\n24 June?:\\r\\nBefore the main events, in the beginning of June, there are the Ninot and Children's Ninot Exhibition (Exposici܇n del Ninot y del Ninot infantil), the Paella Contest (Certamen de Paellas), the Tribute to Past Foguerers and Barraquers (La ofrenda a foguerers y barraquers fallecidos), the Opening Ceremony (El Preg܇n), the Ninot Parade (La Cabalgata del Ninot), and the Street Parade of Ninots competition (La plant de los Ninots de career).\\r\\nAfter 24 June, there is the Firework Display Competition (Concurso de Castillos de Fuegos Artificiales) and the String of Firecrackers Display (Concurso de tracas) in Postiguet Beach. There are also sports events and a Medieval Street Market.\\r\\nThe Bonfires commissions host a number of other events during the rest of the year. In autumn, there is a musical and dancing competition known as the Artistic Competition (Concurso artstico). In December, there is the Christmas Carol Competition (Concurso de villancicos). In May, there is the Beauty of the Fire Contest (Festival de elecci܇n de la Bellea del Foc), which is the most important event outside the festive period, followed by the Beauty of the Fire Proclamation (Proclamaci܇n de la Bellea del Foc). During the year, there are the Presentations of the Beauties in all the districts of Alicante.\\r\\nBonfires are organised into commissions which fundraise and host the other events throughout the year. A member of a commission is called a foguerer. A commission usually represents one area, a place or an avenue in the city, but there are many areas with numerous commissions. (For example, Carolinas has five commissions: Carolinas Altas, Carolinas Bajas, Foguerer-Carolinas, Doctor Bergez-Carolinas and Bola de Oro.) In Alicante there are more than 90 commissions (and so many others for children).\\r\\nA barraca is a group of friends who don't take part in all the activities, and they raise money only to eat, drink and dance during the festival in a place in the street called the barraca.[citation needed] The member of a barraca is called barraquer.\\r\\nThe barracas and the rac܇s are places in the street with tables, chairs, a bar, an orchestra and a dance floor. They are places for people to eat, talk, drink, dance and socializing during the festivities. The difference between the barraca and the rac܇ is that the rac܇ is for the entire district and admission is free, while entrance to the barraca is restricted.[citation needed] The rac܇ is made by the foguerers and the \\"barraca\\" is made by the \\"barraquers\\".\\r\\nThe commissions organize and take part in several events during the year: an artistic competition, parades, beauty contests, etc. These activities are open to the general public and the participation of the district's residents is very important and, sometimes, they are the main group. In districts such as Ciudad de Ass, Florida-Portazgo, Los ngeles and Carolinas Altas, the relationship between the commission and the district's residents is very strong.\\r\\nA very important source of financing for the festival is a lottery administered by the commission, although there are other sources such as tombolas, raffles, or sales.\\r\\nBeauty is the most emblematic element in the Bonfires after the monument. The Beauty is a woman who is the queen of the festival . There are both Beauties and Infantile Beauties representing Bonfires and Infantile Bonfires respectively.\\r\\nSince a Beauty is the representative of a particular commission, there are near 90 Beauties and so many Infantile Beauties in Alicante. A Beauty can have two or four Honour Ladies in her commission.\\r\\nThere are certain Honour Ladies for the whole city. The Beauty of the Fire (Bellea del Foc) is the queen of the festival in all the city and there are also six Ladies of the Fire (Damas del Foc).\\r\\nThere are three types of traditional clothes:\\r\\nNovia alicantina (Alicantinian Bride): the costume that Beauties and Honour Ladies wear. It is made up of:\\r\\nLabradora (farmer): the costume for the other women. It is made up of:\\r\\nZaragelles: the costume for the men. It is made up of:\\r\\nBonfires are an art show. In autumn, there is an artistic competition among the Bonfire Commissioners. In the Festival, there are Ninots (wooden figures) in the street. This is an old tradition that was revived in 2008. Every year there is an Official Festival Poster, a beautiful art demonstration. But the most important in this festival are the Monuments, who are called Bonfires (Hogueras or Fogueres). They are made of wood, cardboard, mud, paintings and, nowadays, of cork and polyurethane too. A Bonfire is not only an artistic creation, it is a critique of the societal, political and economic situation of the world in general and the city of Alicante especially. Critiques are made across the \\"Ninot\\" or figure. The Ninot usually represents a famous person, often an amusing parody of a politician.\\r\\nThe Bonfires are not the same as the Valencian Fallas. When Bonfires originated in Alicante there were not made by \\"fallero\\" artists, and the first Bonfires were made by local painters and sculptors. They did not imitate the Valencian style; they were very vanguardist and they followed Art-Dco and other artistic currents. This vanguard continued throughout the history of the event (except 70's, when Valencian style was adopted), and today Bonfires are different still.\\r\\nA Bonfire is paid for by contributions by the Bonfire Commission, together with donations from residents and shops. The Monument Competition is the most important contest in the Bonfire events. Monuments are divided into seven categories according to the price. There are 6 categories from 1st to 6th, and a Special Category. The latter category consists of more expensive bonfires costing more than 60,100 euros.\\r\\nThe most important artists throughout the Bonfire's history are Gast܇n Castell܇, Ram܇n Marco, Remigio Soler, ngel Martn, Pedro Soriano, Jos Mu?oz and Paco Juan. The most successful district is Benal~a, with 18 victories. Other successful districts are Ciudad de Ass, Carolinas Altas, Mercado Central, Alfonso el Sabio and Hernn Corts.\\r\\nBonfires are kindled on the 20th in an act called \\"La plant\\", and they are burned on the 24th in a very beautiful and emotive act called \\"La crem\\" (the burning). The former is the beginning of the Alicantinian Festival and the latter marks the end of the Festival.","input":"Where is las hogueras de san juan celebrated?"},{"output":"The English Channel","context":"The English Channel (French: la Manche, \\"The Sleeve\\"; German: ?rmelkanal, \\"Sleeve Channel\\"; Breton: Mor Breizh, \\"Sea of Brittany\\"; Cornish: Mor Bretannek, \\"Sea of Brittany\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and links the southern part of the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. It is the busiest shipping area in the world.\\r\\nIt is about 560?km (350?mi) long and varies in width from 240?km (150?mi) at its widest to 33.3?km (20.7?mi) in the Strait of Dover.[1] It is the smallest of the shallow seas around the continental shelf of Europe, covering an area of some 75,000?km2 (29,000?sq?mi).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the English Channel as follows:[3]\\r\\nOn the West.\\r\\nA line joining Isle Vierge (483823N 43413W? / ?48.63972N 4.57028W? / 48.63972; -4.57028) to Lands End (5004N 543W? / ?50.067N 5.717W? / 50.067; -5.717).\\r\\nOn the East.\\r\\nThe Southwestern limit of the North Sea.\\r\\nThe IHO defines the southwestern limit of the North Sea as \\"a line joining the Walde Lighthouse (France, 155'E) and Leathercoat Point (England, 5110'N)\\".[3] The Walde Lighthouse is 6?km east of Calais (505906N 15500E? / ?50.98500N 1.91667E? / 50.98500; 1.91667), and Leathercoat Point is at the north end of St Margaret's Bay, Kent (511000N 12400E? / ?51.16667N 1.40000E? / 51.16667; 1.40000).\\r\\nThe Strait of Dover (French: Pas de Calais), at the Channel's eastern end, is its narrowest point, while its widest point lies between Lyme Bay and the Gulf of Saint Malo, near its midpoint.[1] It is relatively shallow, with an average depth of about 120?m (390?ft) at its widest part, reducing to a depth of about 45?m (148?ft) between Dover and Calais. Eastwards from there the adjoining North Sea reduces to about 26?m (85?ft) in the Broad Fourteens where it lies over the watershed of the former land bridge between East Anglia and the Low Countries. It reaches a maximum depth of 180?m (590?ft) in the submerged valley of Hurd's Deep, 48?km (30?mi) west-northwest of Guernsey.[4]  The eastern region along the French coast between Cherbourg and the mouth of the Seine river at Le Havre is frequently referred to as the Bay of the Seine (French: Baie de Seine).[5]\\r\\nThere are several major islands in the Channel, the most notable being the Isle of Wight off the English coast, and the Channel Islands, British Crown dependencies off the coast of France. The coastline, particularly on the French shore, is deeply indented; several small islands close to the coastline, including Chausey and Mont Saint-Michel, are within French jurisdiction. The Cotentin Peninsula in France juts out into the Channel, whilst on the English side there is a small parallel strait known as the Solent between the Isle of Wight and the mainland. The Celtic Sea is to the west of the Channel.\\r\\nThe Channel acts as a funnel that amplifies the tidal range from less than a metre as observed at sea[clarification needed] to more than 6 metres as observed in the Channel Islands, the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula and the north coast of Brittany. The time difference of about six hours between high water at the eastern and western limits of the Channel is indicative of the tidal range being amplified further by resonance.[6]\\r\\nIn the UK Shipping Forecast the Channel is divided into the following areas, from the east:\\r\\n[7]\\r\\nUntil the 18th century, the English Channel had no fixed name either in English or in French. It was never defined as a political border, and the names were more or less descriptive. It was not considered as the property of a nation. Strangely, before the development of the modern nations, British scholars very often referred to it as \\"Gaulish\\" (Gallicum in Latin) and French scholars as \\"British\\" or \\"English\\".[21] The name \\"English Channel\\" has been widely used since the early 18th century, possibly originating from the designation Engelse Kanaal in Dutch sea maps from the 16th century onwards. In modern Dutch, however, it is known as Het Kanaal (with no reference to the word \\"English\\").[22] Later, it has also been known as the \\"British Channel\\"[23] or the \\"British Sea\\". It was called Oceanus Britannicus by the 2nd-century geographer Ptolemy. The same name is used on an Italian map of about 1450, which gives the alternative name of canalites Angliepossibly the first recorded use of the \\"Channel\\" designation.[24] The Anglo-Saxon texts often call it Se-s? (\\"South Sea\\") as opposed to Nore-s? (\\"North Sea\\" = Bristol Channel). The common word channel was first recorded in Middle English in the 13th century and was borrowed from Old French chanel, variant form of chenel \\"canal\\".\\r\\nThe French name la Manche has been in use since at least the 17th century.[2] The name is usually said to refer to the Channel's sleeve (French: la manche) shape. Folk etymology has derived it from a Celtic word meaning channel that is also the source of the name for the Minch in Scotland,[25] but this name was never mentioned before the 17th century, and French and British sources of that time are perfectly clear about its etymology.[26] The name in Breton (Mor Breizh) means \\"Breton Sea\\", and its Cornish name (Mor Bretannek) means \\"British Sea\\".\\r\\nThe Channel is of geologically recent origin, having been dry land for most of the Pleistocene period.[27] Before the Devensian glaciation (the most recent ice age, which ended around 10,000 years ago), Britain and Ireland were part of continental Europe, linked by an unbroken Weald-Artois Anticline, a ridge that acted as a natural dam holding back a large freshwater pro-glacial lake in the Doggerland region, now submerged under the North Sea. During this period the North Sea and almost all of the British Isles were covered by ice. The lake was fed by meltwater from the Baltic and from the Caledonian and Scandinavian ice sheets that joined to the north, blocking its exit. The sea level was about 120?m (390?ft) lower than it is today. Then, between 450,000 and 180,000?years ago, at least two catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods breached the WealdÿArtois anticline.\\r\\nThe first flood would have lasted for several months, releasing as much as one million cubic metres of water per second.[28][29] The flood started with large but localized waterfalls over the ridge, which excavated depressions now known as the Fosses Dangeard. The flow eroded the retaining ridge, causing the rock dam to fail and releasing lake water into the Atlantic. After multiple episodes of changing sea level, during which the Fosses Dangeard were largely infilled by various layers of sediment, another catastrophic flood carved a large bedrock-floored valley, the Lobourg Channel, some 500 m wide and 25 m deep, from the southern North Sea basin through the centre of the Straits of Dover and into the English Channel. It left streamlined islands, longitudinal erosional grooves, and other features characteristic of catastrophic megaflood events, still present on the sea floor and now revealed by high-resolution sonar.[30][31][32] Through the scoured channel passed a river, which drained the combined Rhine and Thames westwards to the Atlantic.\\r\\nThe flooding destroyed the ridge that connected Britain to continental Europe, although a land connection across the southern North Sea would have existed intermittently at later times when periods of glaciation resulted in lowering of sea levels.[33] At the end of the last glacial period, rising sea levels finally severed the last land connection.\\r\\nWilliam Shakespeare, Richard II (Act II, Scene 1)\\r\\nThe channel, which delayed human reoccupation of Great Britain for more than 100,000 years,[34] has in historic times been both an easy entry for seafaring people and a key natural defence, halting invading armies while in conjunction with control of the North Sea allowing Britain to blockade the continent.[citation needed] The most significant failed invasion threats came when the Dutch and Belgian ports were held by a major continental power, e.g. from the Spanish Armada in 1588, Napoleon during the Napoleonic Wars, and Nazi Germany during World War II. Successful invasions include the Roman conquest of Britain and the Norman Conquest in 1066, while the concentration of excellent harbours in the Western Channel on Britain's south coast made possible the largest invasion of all time, the Normandy Landings in 1944. Channel naval battles include the Battle of the Downs (1639), Battle of Goodwin Sands (1652), the Battle of Portland (1653), the Battle of La Hougue (1692) and the engagement between USS Kearsarge and CSS Alabama (1864).\\r\\nIn more peaceful times the Channel served as a link joining shared cultures and political structures, particularly the huge Angevin Empire from 1135 to 1217. For nearly a thousand years, the Channel also provided a link between the Modern Celtic regions and languages of Cornwall and Brittany. Brittany was founded by Britons who fled Cornwall and Devon after Anglo-Saxon encroachment. In Brittany, there is a region known as \\"Cornouaille\\" (Cornwall) in French and \\"Kernev\\" in Breton[35] In ancient times there was also a \\"Domnonia\\" (Devon) in Brittany as well.\\r\\nIn February 1684, ice formed on the sea in a belt 3 miles (4.8?km) wide off the coast of Kent and 2 miles (3.2?km) wide on the French side.[36][37]\\r\\nRemnants of a mesolithic boatyard have been found on the Isle of Wight. Wheat was traded across the Channel about 8,000 years ago.[38][39] \\"... Sophisticated social networks linked the Neolithic front in southern Europe to the Mesolithic peoples of northern Europe.\\" The Ferriby Boats, Hanson Log Boats and the later Dover Bronze Age Boat could carry a substantial cross-Channel cargo.[40]\\r\\nDiodorus Siculus and Pliny[41] both suggest trade between the rebel Celtic tribes of Armorica and Iron Age Britain flourished. In 55 BC Julius Caesar invaded, claiming that the Britons had aided the Veneti against him the previous year. He was more successful in 54 BC, but Britain was not fully established as part of the Roman Empire until completion of the invasion by Aulus Plautius in 43 AD. A brisk and regular trade began between ports in Roman Gaul and those in Britain. This traffic continued until the end of Roman rule in Britain in 410 AD, after which the early Anglo-Saxons left less clear historical records.\\r\\nIn the power vacuum left by the retreating Romans, the Germanic Angles, Saxons, and Jutes began the next great migration across the North Sea. Having already been used as mercenaries in Britain by the Romans, many people from these tribes crossed during the Migration Period, conquering and perhaps displacing the native Celtic populations.[42]\\r\\nThe attack on Lindisfarne in 793 is generally considered the beginning of the Viking Age. For the next 250?years the Scandinavian raiders of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark dominated the North Sea, raiding monasteries, homes, and towns along the coast and along the rivers that ran inland. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle they began to settle in Britain in 851. They continued to settle in the British Isles and the continent until around 1050.[43]\\r\\nThe fiefdom of Normandy was created for the Viking leader Rollo (also known as Robert of Normandy). Rollo had besieged Paris but in 911 entered vassalage to the king of the West Franks Charles the Simple through the Treaty of St.-Claire-sur-Epte. In exchange for his homage and fealty, Rollo legally gained the territory he and his Viking allies had previously conquered. The name \\"Normandy\\" reflects Rollo's Viking (i.e. \\"Northman\\") origins.\\r\\nThe descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local Gallo-Romance language and intermarried with the area's inhabitants and became the Normans ÿ a Norman French-speaking mixture of Scandinavians, Hiberno-Norse, Orcadians, Anglo-Danish, and indigenous Franks and Gauls.\\r\\nRollo's descendant William, Duke of Normandy became king of England in 1066 in the Norman Conquest beginning with the Battle of Hastings, while retaining the fiefdom of Normandy for himself and his descendants. In 1204, during the reign of King John, mainland Normandy was taken from England by France under Philip II, while insular Normandy (the Channel Islands) remained under English control. In 1259, Henry III of England recognised the legality of French possession of mainland Normandy under the Treaty of Paris. His successors, however, often fought to regain control of mainland Normandy.\\r\\nWith the rise of William the Conqueror the North Sea and Channel began to lose some of their importance. The new order oriented most of England and Scandinavia's trade south, toward the Mediterranean and the Orient.\\r\\nAlthough the British surrendered claims to mainland Normandy and other French possessions in 1801, the monarch of the United Kingdom retains the title Duke of Normandy in respect to the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands (except for Chausey) are Crown dependencies of the British Crown. Thus the Loyal toast in the Channel Islands is La Reine, notre Duc (\\"The Queen, our Duke\\"). The British monarch is understood to not be the Duke of Normandy in regards of the French region of Normandy described herein, by virtue of the Treaty of Paris of 1259, the surrender of French possessions in 1801, and the belief that the rights of succession to that title are subject to Salic Law which excludes inheritance through female heirs.\\r\\nFrench Normandy was occupied by English forces during the Hundred Years' War in 1346ÿ1360 and again in 1415ÿ1450.\\r\\nFrom the reign of Elizabeth I, English foreign policy concentrated on preventing invasion across the Channel by ensuring no major European power controlled the potential Dutch and Flemish invasion ports. Her climb to the pre-eminent sea power of the world began in 1588 as the attempted invasion of the Spanish Armada was defeated by the combination of outstanding naval tactics by the English and the Dutch under command of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham with Sir Francis Drake second in command, and the following stormy weather. Over the centuries the Royal Navy slowly grew to be the most powerful in the world.[44]\\r\\nThe building of the British Empire was possible only because the Royal Navy eventually managed to exercise unquestioned control over the seas around Europe, especially the Channel and the North Sea. During the Seven Years' War, France attempted to launch an invasion of Britain. To achieve this France needed to gain control of the Channel for several weeks, but was thwarted following the British naval victory at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759.\\r\\nAnother significant challenge to British domination of the seas came during the Napoleonic Wars. The Battle of Trafalgar took place off the coast of Spain against a combined French and Spanish fleet and was won by Admiral Horatio Nelson, ending Napoleon's plans for a cross-Channel invasion and securing British dominance of the seas for over a century.\\r\\nThe exceptional strategic importance of the Channel as a tool for blockade was recognised by the First Sea Lord Admiral Fisher in the years before World War I. \\"Five keys lock up the world! Singapore, the Cape, Alexandria, Gibraltar, Dover.\\"[45] However, on 25 July 1909 Louis Blriot made the first Channel crossing from Calais to Dover in an aeroplane. Blriot's crossing signalled the end of the Channel as a barrier-moat for England against foreign enemies.\\r\\nBecause the Kaiserliche Marine surface fleet could not match the British Grand Fleet, the Germans developed submarine warfare, which was to become a far greater threat to Britain. The Dover Patrol was set up just before the war started to escort cross-Channel troopships and to prevent submarines from sailing in the Channel, obliging them to travel to the Atlantic via the much longer route around Scotland.\\r\\nOn land, the German army attempted to capture Channel ports in the Race to the Sea but although the trenches are often said to have stretched \\"from the frontier of Switzerland to the English Channel\\", they reached the coast at the North Sea. Much of the British war effort in Flanders was a bloody but successful strategy to prevent the Germans reaching the Channel coast.\\r\\nAt the outset of the war, an attempt was made to block the path of U-boats through the Dover Strait with naval minefields. By February 1915, this had been augmented by a 25 kilometres (16?mi) stretch of light steel netting called the Dover Barrage, which it was hoped would ensnare submerged submarines. After initial success, the Germans learned how to pass through the barrage, aided by the unreliability of British mines.[46] On 31 January 1917, the Germans restarted unrestricted submarine warfare leading to dire Admiralty predictions that submarines would defeat Britain by November,[47] the most dangerous situation Britain faced in either world war.\\r\\nThe Battle of Passchendaele in 1917 was fought to reduce the threat by capturing the submarine bases on the Belgian coast, though it was the introduction of convoys and not capture of the bases that averted defeat. In April 1918 the Dover Patrol carried out the famous Zeebrugge Raid against the U-boat bases. During 1917, the Dover Barrage was re-sited with improved mines and more effective nets, aided by regular patrols by small warships equipped with powerful searchlights. A German attack on these vessels resulted in the Battle of Dover Strait in 1917.[48] A much more ambitious attempt to improve the barrage, by installing eight massive concrete towers across the strait was called the Admiralty M-N Scheme but only two towers were nearing completion at the end of the war and the project was abandoned.[49]\\r\\nThe naval blockade in the Channel and North Sea was one of the decisive factors in the German defeat in 1918.[50]\\r\\nDuring the Second World War, naval activity in the European theatre was primarily limited to the Atlantic. During the Battle of France in May 1940, the German forces succeeded in capturing both Boulogne and Calais, thereby threatening the line of retreat for the British Expeditionary Force. By a combination of hard fighting and German indecision, the port of Dunkirk was kept open allowing 338,000 Allied troops to be evacuated in Operation Dynamo. More than 11,000 were evacuated from Le Havre during Operation Cycle[51] and a further 192,000 were evacuated from ports further down the coast in Operation Ariel in June 1940.[52] The early stages of the Battle of Britain[53] featured air attacks on Channel shipping and ports, and until the Normandy Landings (with the exception of the Channel Dash) the narrow waters were too dangerous for major warships. Despite these early successes against shipping, the Germans did not win the air supremacy necessary for Operation Sealion, the projected cross-Channel invasion.\\r\\nThe Channel subsequently became the stage for an intensive coastal war, featuring submarines, minesweepers, and Fast Attack Craft.[54]\\r\\nDieppe was the site of an ill-fated Dieppe Raid by Canadian and British armed forces. More successful was the later Operation Overlord (D-Day), a massive invasion of German-occupied France by Allied troops. Caen, Cherbourg, Carentan, Falaise and other Norman towns endured many casualties in the fight for the province, which continued until the closing of the so-called Falaise gap between Chambois and Montormel, then liberation of Le Havre.\\r\\nThe Channel Islands were the only part of the British Commonwealth occupied by Germany (excepting the part of Egypt occupied by the Afrika Korps at the time of the Second Battle of El Alamein, which was a protectorate and not part of the Commonwealth). The German occupation of 1940ÿ1945 was harsh, with some island residents being taken for slave labour on the Continent; native Jews sent to concentration camps; partisan resistance and retribution; accusations of collaboration; and slave labour (primarily Russians and eastern Europeans) being brought to the islands to build fortifications.[citation needed] The Royal Navy blockaded the islands from time to time, particularly following the liberation of mainland Normandy in 1944. Intense negotiations resulted in some Red Cross humanitarian aid, but there was considerable hunger and privation during the occupation, particularly in the final months, when the population was close to starvation. The German troops on the islands surrendered on 9 May 1945, a day after the final surrender in mainland Europe.\\r\\nThe English Channel coast is far more densely populated on the English shore. The most significant towns and cities along both the English and French sides of the Channel (each with more than 20,000 inhabitants, ranked in descending order; populations are the urban area populations from the 1999 French census, 2001 UK census, and 2001 Jersey census) are as follows:\\r\\nThe Channel has traffic on both the UK-Europe and North Sea-Atlantic routes, and is the world's busiest seaway, with over 500 ships per day.[55] Following an accident in January 1971 and a series of disastrous collisions with wreckage in February,[56] the Dover TSS[57] the world's first radar-controlled Traffic Separation Scheme was set up by the International Maritime Organization. The scheme mandates that vessels travelling north must use the French side, travelling south the English side. There is a separation zone between the two lanes.[58]\\r\\nIn December 2002 the MV Tricolor, carrying S30m of luxury cars sank 32?km (20?mi) northwest of Dunkirk after collision in fog with the container ship Kariba. The cargo ship Nicola ran into the wreckage the next day. There was no loss of life.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe shore-based long range traffic control system was updated in 2003 and there is a series of Traffic Separation Systems in operation.[59] Though the system is inherently incapable of reaching the levels of safety obtained from aviation systems such as the Traffic Collision Avoidance System, it has reduced accidents to one or two per year.[citation needed]\\r\\nMarine GPS systems allow ships to be preprogrammed to follow navigational channels accurately and automatically, further avoiding risk of running aground, but following the fatal collision between Dutch Aquamarine and Ash in October 2001, Britain's Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) issued a safety bulletin saying it believed that in these most unusual circumstances GPS use had actually contributed to the collision.[60] The ships were maintaining a very precise automated course, one directly behind the other, rather than making use of the full width of the traffic lanes as a human navigator would.\\r\\nA combination of radar difficulties in monitoring areas near cliffs, a failure of a CCTV system, incorrect operation of the anchor, the inability of the crew to follow standard procedures of using a GPS to provide early warning of the ship dragging the anchor and reluctance to admit the mistake and start the engine led to the MV Willy running aground in Cawsand bay, Cornwall in January 2002. The MAIB report makes it clear that the harbour controllers were informed of impending disaster by shore observers before the crew were themselves aware.[61] The village of Kingsand was evacuated for three days because of the risk of explosion, and the ship was stranded for 11 days.[62][63][64]\\r\\nAs a busy shipping lane, the Channel experiences environmental problems following accidents involving ships with toxic cargo and oil spills.[65] Indeed, over 40% of the UK incidents threatening pollution occur in or very near the Channel.[66] One of the recent occurrences was the MSC Napoli, which on 18 January 2007 was beached with nearly 1700?tonnes of dangerous cargo in Lyme Bay, a protected World Heritage Site coastline.[67] The ship had been damaged and was en route to Portland Harbour.\\r\\nThe number of ferry routes crossing the Strait of Dover has reduced since the Channel Tunnel opened. Current cross-channel ferry routes are:\\r\\nMany travellers cross beneath the Channel using the Channel Tunnel, first proposed in the early 19th century and finally opened in 1994, connecting the UK and France by rail. It is now routine to travel between Paris or Brussels and London on the Eurostar train. Freight trains also use the tunnel. Cars, coaches and lorries are carried on Eurotunnel Shuttle trains between Folkestone and Calais.\\r\\nThe coastal resorts of the Channel, such as Brighton and Deauville, inaugurated an era of aristocratic tourism in the early 19th century, which developed into the seaside tourism that has shaped resorts around the world.[citation needed] Short trips across the Channel for leisure purposes are often referred to as Channel Hopping.\\r\\nThe two dominant cultures are English on the north shore of the Channel, French on the south. However, there are also a number of minority languages that are or were found on the shores and islands of the English Channel, which are listed here, with the Channel's name following them.\\r\\nDutch previously had a larger range, and extended into parts of modern-day France.

At the end of the last Ice Age, lower sea levels even permitted walking across.[69][70]\\r\\nPierre Andriel crossed the English Channel aboard the lise, ex the Scottish p.s. \\"Margery\\" in March 1816, one of the earliest seagoing voyages by steam ship.\\r\\nThe paddle steamer Defiance, Captain William Wager, was the first steamer to cross the Channel to Holland, arriving there on 9 May 1816.[71]\\r\\nOn 10 June 1821, English-built paddle steamer Rob Roy was the first passenger ferry to cross channel. The steamer was purchased subsequently by the French postal administration and renamed Henri IV and put into regular passenger service a year later. It was able to make the journey across the Straits of Dover in around three hours.[77]\\r\\nIn June 1843, because of difficulties with Dover harbour, the South Eastern Railway company developed the Boulogne-sur-Mer-Folkestone route as an alternative to Calais-Dover. The first ferry crossed under the command of Captain Hayward.[78]\\r\\nIn 1974 a Welsh coracle piloted by Bernard Thomas of Llechryd crossed the English Channel to France in 13? hours. The journey was undertaken to demonstrate how the Bull Boats of the Mandan Indians of North Dakota could have been copied from coracles introduced by Prince Madog in the 12th century.[79][80]\\r\\nThe Mountbatten class hovercraft (MCH) entered commercial service in August 1968, initially between Dover and Boulogne but later also Ramsgate (Pegwell Bay) to Calais. The journey time Dover to Boulogne was roughly 35?minutes, with six trips per day at peak times. The fastest crossing of the English Channel by a commercial car-carrying hovercraft was 22?minutes, recorded by the Princess Anne MCH SR-N4 Mk3 on 14 September 1995,[81]\\r\\nThe first aircraft to cross the Channel was a balloon in 1785, piloted by Jean Pierre Fran?ois Blanchard (France) and John Jeffries (US).[82]\\r\\nLouis Blriot (France) piloted the first airplane to cross in 1909.\\r\\nThe sport of Channel swimming traces its origins to the latter part of the 19th century when Captain Matthew Webb made the first observed and unassisted swim across the Strait of Dover, swimming from England to France on 24ÿ25 August 1875 in 21?hours 45?minutes.\\r\\nIn 1927, at a time when fewer than ten swimmers (including the first woman, Gertrude Ederle in 1926) had managed to emulate the feat and many dubious claims were being made, the Channel Swimming Association (CSA) was founded to authenticate and ratify swimmers' claims to have swum the Channel and to verify crossing times. The CSA was dissolved in 1999 and was succeeded by two separate organisations: CSA (Ltd) and the Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation (CSPF). Both observe and authenticate cross-Channel swims in the Strait of Dover. The Channel Crossing Association was set up at about this time to cater for unorthodox crossings.\\r\\nThe team with the most number of Channel swims to its credit is the Serpentine Swimming Club in London,[83] followed by the International Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team.[84]\\r\\nBy the end of 2005, 811 people had completed 1,185 verified crossings under the rules of the CSA, the CSA (Ltd), the CSPF and Butlins.\\r\\nThe number of swims conducted under and ratified by the Channel Swimming Association to 2005 was 982 by 665 people. This includes 24 two-way crossings and three three-way crossings.\\r\\nThe number of ratified swims to 2004 was 948 by 675 people (456 men, 214 women). There have been 16 two-way crossings (9 by men and 7 by women). There have been three three-way crossings (2 by men and 1 by a woman). (It is unclear whether this last set of data is comprehensive or CSA only.)\\r\\nThe Strait of Dover is the busiest stretch of water in the world. It is governed by International Law as described in Unorthodox Crossing of the Dover Strait Traffic Separation Scheme.[85] It states: \\"[In] exceptional cases the French Maritime Authorities may grant authority for unorthodox craft to cross French territorial waters within the Traffic Separation Scheme when these craft set off from the British coast, on condition that the request for authorisation is sent to them with the opinion of the British Maritime Authorities.\\"\\r\\nThe CCA, CSA, and CS&PF are the organisations escorting channel swims, because their pilots have the experience, qualifications, and equipment to guarantee the safety of the swimmers they escort.\\r\\nThe fastest verified swim of the Channel was by the Australian Trent Grimsey on 8 September 2012, in 6 hours 55 minutes,[86][87] beating the previous record set in 2007 by Bulgarian swimmer Petar Stoychev.\\r\\nThere may have been some unreported swims of the Channel, by people intent on entering Britain in circumvention of immigration controls. A failed attempt to cross the Channel by two Syrian refugees in October 2014 only came to light when their bodies were later discovered on the shores of the North Sea in Norway and the Netherlands.[88]\\r\\nOn 16 September 1965, two Amphicars crossed from Dover to Calais.[89]","input":"What body of water separates france and england?"},{"output":"Govind Ballabh Pant","context":"The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP), a North Indian state, is the head of the Government of Uttar Pradesh.

Shield[9] is a professional wrestling stable in WWE which consists of Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins who perform on the Raw brand.[10]\\r\\nThe group debuted on November 18, 2012 at the Survivor Series pay-per-view.[5] The Shield was a dominant force in six-man tag team matches with an undefeated televised streak lasting from December 2012 to May 2013, during which they scored a victory at WrestleMania 29[11] and defeated teams containing the likes of Big Show, Chris Jericho, Daniel Bryan, John Cena, Kane, Randy Orton, Ryback, Sheamus, The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Erick Rowan and Luke Harper) and The Undertaker.[9] In May 2013 at Extreme Rules, all three members of The Shield won a championship, with Ambrose winning the United States Championship while Rollins and Reigns captured the WWE Tag Team Championship.[12] Rollins and Reigns were WWE Tag Team Champions until October 2013 and Ambrose was United States Champion until May 2014, which was a record reign for the WWE version of the championship.[13][14] As a Shield member, Reigns gained prominence by setting and equaling elimination records at the 2013 Survivor Series and the 2014 Royal Rumble events.[15][16]\\r\\nIn 2014, The Shield gained victories over The Wyatt Family[17] and Evolution (Batista, Randy Orton and Triple H) in six-man tag matches,[18][19] as well as a win at WrestleMania XXX against The Authority's Kane and The New Age Outlaws (Billy Gunn and Road Dogg).[20] The Shield at different points in their history worked for CM Punk and The Authority while later going on to face their former employers in separate feuds.[21][22] They wrestled in the main event of numerous Raw and SmackDown television shows and headlined one pay-per-view, the 2014 Payback event, which was their final match as a trio until 2017.[19] Rollins left the group on June 2, when he attacked Ambrose and Reigns with a chair and sided with The Authority.[23] Ambrose and Reigns went on their own ways as singles wrestlers later that month, marking the end of The Shield.[6]\\r\\nFollowing the group's dissolution, each member of The Shield went on to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, with six world championship reigns among them (Reigns with three, Rollins with two and Ambrose with one).[24] All three reigned as world champion within a three-minute span at the end of the 2016 Money in the Bank event: Rollins defeated Reigns for the championship and then Ambrose cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase (which he won earlier that night) on Rollins to win the title.[25] In the lead-up to the 2017 SummerSlam pay-per-view, Ambrose and Rollins reunited and captured the Raw Tag Team Championship from Cesaro and Sheamus.[26] Then on the October 9 episode of Raw, Reigns along with Ambrose and Rollins confronted The Miz, officially reuniting The Shield and attacking Cesaro, Sheamus and The Miz himself.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shield has from the beginning of their existence voiced their intentions to fight what they perceived as \\"injustice\\".[4] They were also known for their black ring attire (including protective vests) with each member having their own style,[27][28] their tendency to approach the ring through the live audience[29] and their trademark promos, which were recorded from a first-person perspective using a handheld camcorder.[30] They were a group which possessed excellent teamwork and a willingness to sacrifice themselves as an individual for the good of the team,[31][32] which achieved victories by overwhelming opponents with superior numbers after incapacitating their teammates.[33] The Shield referred to WWE as their \\"yard\\" during their speeches[34][35] and were nicknamed as \\"The Hounds of Justice\\".[27]\\r\\nFor their individual characters:\\r\\nWhile out of character, the group has credited trainer/producer Joey Mercury as a mentor.[43] The group were originally supposed to wear turtlenecks and carry riot shields, but changed their attire before their debut.[44] CM Punk later claimed to have come up with the idea of The Shield, which he proposed were to be his storyline protectors and consisting of Ambrose, Rollins and Kassius OhnoPunk described \\"their guy\\", Reigns, replacing Ohno, who had been rejected by Triple H.[45] WWE Spanish announcer Marcelo Rodrguez had named the group for Ambrose, Reigns and Rollins \\"The Shield\\" on November 19, 2012, one day after the Survivor Series event.[46]\\r\\nThe group debuted on November 18, 2012 at Survivor Series as a villainous group when the debuting Ambrose, Reigns, and the then reigning NXT Champion Seth Rollins interfered in the main event, a triple threat match between CM Punk, John Cena and Ryback for the WWE Championship, when they performed a powerbomb on Ryback through a broadcast table, allowing Punk to pin Cena to retain the title.[47] On the November 26 episode of Raw, the group identified themselves as \\"The Shield\\" and vowed to rally against \\"injustices\\".[4] Despite claiming that they were not working for either CM Punk or Paul Heyman, over the next few weeks on both Raw and SmackDown they would routinely emerge from the crowd to attack Punk's adversaries such as Ryback, The Miz and then WWE Tag Team Champions Team Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane).[4][48] They also attacked Randy Orton after he defeated Brad Maddox, who was the referee who helped Punk defeat Ryback during their Hell in a Cell match at the previous Hell in a Cell event for the WWE Championship.[49] This led to The Shield's debut match at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 16, where they faced Ryback and Team Hell No in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match and emerged victorious.[50][51]\\r\\nAfter TLC, despite continuing to attack Punk's and Maddox's adversaries such as Ric Flair,[52] Brodus Clay[53] and Sheamus,[54] The Shield soon expanded their ambushes to other wrestlers, such as Mick Foley,[30] Tommy Dreamer and Ricardo Rodriguez.[55] The Shield's attacks were also used to write off wrestlers from television via injury angles, such as Randy Orton and Sin Cara, who were already suffering from legitimate injuries.[56][57]\\r\\nOn the January 2, 2013 episode of NXT (which was taped on December 6, 2012),[58] The Shield made their first appearance in NXT, though Rollins and Reigns had already wrestled there before and Rollins was the inaugural NXT Champion.[59][60][61] Rollins defended his title against Corey Graves, but as Graves was about to win the match Ambrose and Reigns attacked him to cause a disqualification so that Rollins retained his title and The Shield then fended off the entire NXT locker room, but retreated from Big E Langston.[62] On the January 9 episode of NXT (which was taped on the same date as the previous episode), Rollins faced Langston in a no disqualifucation match for the title in which the NXT locker room neutralized the other Shield members and Langston defeated Rollins to win the NXT Championship.[63]\\r\\nOn the January 7 episode of Raw, The Shield once again aided CM Punk by attacking Ryback during his Tables, Ladders and Chairs match for the WWE Championship, which resulted in Punk retaining the title.[64] On the January 21 episode of Raw, The Shield performed a triple-powerbomb on The Rock, Punk's WWE Championship contender at the event, resulting in Mr. McMahon declaring that their interference in the title match would result in Punk being stripped of the title.[65] Four days later on SmackDown, Punk denied an alliance with The Shield before calling them out and informing them that he did not want them to interfere in his upcoming title match.[66] However, during Punk's title match at the Royal Rumble on January 27 a blackout occurred, The Rock was attacked by The Shield in the darkness and when the lights came back on he had been put through the announce table, leading to Punk pinning The Rock and retaining the title, only for the match to be immediately restarted by McMahon with The Rock winning the WWE Championship.[67] The following night on Raw it was revealed through footage played by McMahon that Punk's manager Paul Heyman had been paying The Shield and Brad Maddox to work for him all along.[68]\\r\\nOn the January 28 episode of Raw, The Shield attacked John Cena, as well as Sheamus and Ryback when they attempted to save Cena.[68] The next week on Raw, Maddox called out The Shield and revealed that he was the one who had given McMahon the footage showing that they were working for Heyman, thus prompting The Shield to attack Maddox until they were forced to retreat due to an attack by Cena, Ryback and Sheamus.[69] The Shield justified their attacks due to a \\"decade of injustice\\" caused by Cena creating an environment where any wrestler would not face consequences for his actions and whose mentality they felt had spread to other wrestlers like Ryback and Sheamus.[70] This set up a six-man tag team match on February 17 at Elimination Chamber,[71] which The Shield won.[72][73]\\r\\nThe Shield had their first Raw match the following night, when they defeated the team of Ryback, Sheamus and Chris Jericho.[74] Sheamus then formed an alliance with Randy Orton to battle The Shield, which prompted The Shield to inadvertently provoke Big Show into attacking them while attacking Orton on the March 1 episode of SmackDown.[75] This led to The Shield's first singles match on the March 11 episode of Raw, when Rollins faced Big Show and lost by disqualification as Ambrose and Reigns interfered and beat Big Show down.[76] Despite twice helping Orton and Sheamus to fend off The Shield, Big Show on both occasions turned on the duo immediately afterwards.[77] The Shield then challenged Orton and Sheamus to find a partner for a match with them at WrestleMania 29, which resulted in Big Show volunteering, but Orton and Sheamus chose Ryback as their partner.[78] Meanwhile, Mark Henry's distraction of Ryback resulted in The Shield conducting a successful assault on Ryback,[78] resulting in Ryback being inserted into a WrestleMania 29 match against Henry.[79] Without a partner, Orton and Sheamus eventually accepted Big Show's offer to take on a common enemy despite their mistrust of him.[80] On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, The Shield took advantage of their opponents' inability to work together to win in their WrestleMania debut.[81][82]\\r\\nOn the April 8 episode of Raw, The Shield attempted to attack The Undertaker, but were ultimately forced to retreat by Team Hell No.[83] This led The Shield to face the combination of The Brothers of Destruction and Team Hell No (Undertaker, Kane and Bryan), which The Shield defeated on the April 22 episode of Raw.[84] On the April 26 episode of SmackDown, Ambrose made his singles debut against The Undertaker and lost via submission, but after the match The Shield attacked Undertaker and performed a triple-powerbomb on him through the announce table.[85] On the April 29 episode of Raw, The Shield defeated Team Hell No and WWE Champion John Cena in a six-man tag team match with Reigns pinning Cena for the win.[86] Ambrose then started a feud with United States Champion Kofi Kingston after pinning him in a six-man tag team match also involving The Usos (Jey and Jimmy Uso).[87][88] On the May 13 episode of Raw, The Shield's undefeated streak in televised six-man tag team matches ended in a disqualification loss in an elimination match against Cena, Kane and Bryan: with Kane and Bryan eliminated, Cena pinned Rollins and then Reigns was disqualified, with Ambrose also being disqualified when Reigns and Rollins attacked Cena.[89]\\r\\nOn May 19 at Extreme Rules, Ambrose defeated Kofi Kingston to win the United States Championship while later that same night Rollins and Reigns defeated Team Hell No to also win the WWE Tag Team Championship.[90] Ambrose faced Kingston on the May 24 episode of SmackDown in a rematch and retained the title when Rollins and Reigns interfered, thus causing a disqualification.[91] Ambrose defeated Kingston in another rematch for the title on the May 27 episode of Raw and Rollins and Reigns retained the WWE Tag Team Championship in a rematch against Team Hell No.[92] On the June 14 episode of SmackDown, The Shield's unpinned/unsubmitted streak in televised six-man tag team matches came to an end at the hands of Team Hell No and Randy Orton, when Daniel Bryan submitted Rollins.[93][94] On June 16 at Payback, Ambrose defeated Kane via countout to retain the United States Championship while Rollins and Reigns successful defended their WWE Tag Team Championship by defeating Bryan and Orton.[95][96] The following night on Raw, Ambrose had a title rematch against Kane, and once again retained after Rollins and Reigns interfered and Ambrose was disqualified.[97]\\r\\nAfter The Shield attacked Christian[98] and The Usos became the number one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship,[99] The Shield was defeated by them in a six-man tag match on the June 28 episode of SmackDown.[100] On July 14 during the Money in the Bank pre-show, Rollins and Reigns defeated The Usos to retain the WWE Tag Team Championship.[101] Later in the event, they interfered in Ambrose's World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match, but The Usos in turn attacked Reigns and Rollins and Ambrose failed to win the match.[102] The Shield then began a feud with Mark Henry[103] and they defeated Henry and The Usos in two six-man tag team matches,[104][105] but lost to the team of Henry, Big Show and Rob Van Dam.[106] Ambrose went on to retain the championship by disqualification against Van Dam during the SummerSlam kickoff show on August 18.[107]\\r\\nThe following night on the August 19 episode of Raw, The Shield began working for chief operating officer Triple H and they would aid WWE Champion and \\"the face of WWE\\" Randy Orton against his number one contender Daniel Bryan, while also attacking wrestlers like Big Show and Dolph Ziggler for speaking out against Triple H's regime.[108][109] At Night of Champions on September 15, The Shield enjoyed successful title defenses when Ambrose defeated Ziggler while Rollins and Reigns defeated The Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil).[110] At Battleground on October 6, after being kayfabe fired, Cody Rhodes and Goldust earned their jobs back by beating Rollins and Reigns in a non-title match.[111] On the September 23 episode of Raw, The Shield lost an eleven-on-three handicap elimination match during which every member was pinned, this being Reigns' first, as The Usos, Ziggler and Bryan contributed to the pins.[112] On the October 14 episode of Raw, Rollins and Reigns faced the Rhodes brothers again in a no disqualification match and lost the WWE Tag Team Championship after Big Show attacked them during the match.[113] On the October 16 episode of Main Event, Ambrose successfully retained the title against Ziggler.[114] At Hell in a Cell on October 27, Rollins and Reigns lost a triple threat tag team match for the WWE Tag Team Championship against the Rhodes Brothers and The Usos, while Ambrose retained the championship despite a countout loss to Big E Langston.[115]\\r\\nThe first seeds of dissension were sown in The Shield (especially between Ambrose and Reigns) with Ambrose's boasting of being the only member left with a championship,[116] but from then on Ambrose was frequently pinned during The Shield's matches.[117][118] At Survivor Series on November 24, The Shield teamed with The Real Americans (Antonio Cesaro and Jack Swagger ) to defeat the team of Rey Mysterio, the Rhodes Brothers and The Usos in a Survivor Series elimination tag team match, with Ambrose being the first man eliminated, Rollins (with one elimination) the fourth man eliminated for his team and Reigns the sole survivor after eliminating four opponents.[119]\\r\\nIn late November, CM Punk's criticism of Triple H earned him an attack by The Shield,[120] but Punk tasted revenge at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 15 when he overcame The Shield in a handicap match, capitalizing on The Shield's lack of co-ordination after Ambrose received a spear from Reigns aimed for Punk, thus making him the only person to beat The Shield in a handicap match.[121] Punk documented in an out-of-character interview a year later on how he was constantly reminded to make Reigns look \\"really, really strong\\" in the match at TLC to the point that Punk requested to lose the match, which was rejected.[122]\\r\\nGoing into 2014, Punk's taunts increased tension between The Shield members[123] and Reigns emerged as the only Shield member to defeat Punk in a singles match, albeit with Ambrose's interference.[124] All three members of The Shield competed in the 2014 Royal Rumble match, during which Ambrose tried to eliminate Reigns, who retaliated by eliminating both Ambrose and Rollins.[125] Reigns eventually finished as runner-up in the match while setting a new record for most eliminations in a single Royal Rumble match with 12, with Ambrose and Rollins scoring three eliminations each and Rollins spending the second longest amount of time in the match after CM Punk.[126]\\r\\nOn the January 27 episode of Raw, The Shield faced the team of Daniel Bryan, John Cena and Sheamus in a six-man tag-team match in which the winning team would enter the Elimination Chamber match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, but The Shield were denied that opportunity when The Wyatt Family attacked their opponents, causing The Shield to lose by disqualification.[127] The Shield vowed revenge, therefore a match was set up between The Shield and The Wyatt Family.[128] With both The Shield and The Wyatt Family being villainous teams, WWE positioned The Shield as the team the audience should root for on the February 10 episode of Raw, when The Shield was willing to engage in a confrontation while The Wyatt Family backed down.[129][130] Meanwhile on the February 10 episode of Raw, Ambrose's open challenge for the title was answered by Mark Henry, with Ambrose retaining by disqualification due to The Shield's interference[131] and Reigns continued his tension with Ambrose by defeating Henry without interference.[132] At Elimination Chamber on February 23, The Shield lost to The Wyatt Family as Ambrose and Bray Wyatt brawled into the crowd, but Wyatt later returned to the ring with no sign of Ambrose, which caused Rollins and Reigns to be outnumbered and overwhelmed.[133] On the March 3 episode of Raw, The Shield lost a rematch against The Wyatt Family when The Shield's poor teamwork led to Rollins walking out during the match, with Rollins claiming that he had enough of being the glue holding the group together.[134]\\r\\nOn the March 7 episode of SmackDown, the members of The Shield met in the ring to clear the air on their disharmony and Rollins said that his actions achieved his purpose of getting Ambrose and Reigns to finally see eye-to-eye, which led Ambrose and Rollins hit each other and the trio ultimately reconciled.[135]\\r\\nThe Shield's next feud was against Kane, who was now acting as the Director of Operations for The Authority and had ordered The Shield to attack commentator Jerry Lawler on the March 17 episode of Raw, but The Shield attacked Kane instead, thus turning all of them into fan favorites (heroic characters).[136][137] In retaliation, Kane and The New Age Outlaws attacked The Shield on the March 21 episode of SmackDown while the group was already being double-teamed by Rybaxel (Curtis Axel and Ryback) and The Real Americans after an inconclusive fatal four-way tag team match meant to determine the contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship.[138] The Shield got their revenge when they cost Rybaxel their match on the following Raw and attacked them before defeating The Real Americans on the same night, while immediately afterwards Kane and The New Age Outlaws challenged them to a match at WrestleMania XXX,[139] which The Shield won quickly and decisively.[140]\\r\\nThe following night on the post-WrestleMania episode of Raw, Kane inadvertently revealed that Triple H had masterminded the attack on The Shield on the previous month's SmackDown and as a result, when Triple H faced the new WWE World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan in a title match after Bryan had already been attacked by Kane, Orton and Batista, The Shield interrupted the match to turn on Triple H, chasing the other wrestlers away to protect Bryan.[141] The Shield finally defeated The Wyatt Family in a six-man tag match on the April 8 episode of Main Event.[142] On the April 14 episode of Raw, Triple H forced The Shield to wrestle an 11-on-3 handicap match, which ended in a no contest and left The Shield outnumbered and beaten down before being further attacked by Triple H, Orton and Batista, who reformed the group Evolution.[143] Booked to wrestle another 11-on-3 handicap match on the April 25 episode of SmackDown, The Shield attacked and took out six of their opponents throughout SmackDown and defeated the remaining five in the handicap match.[144] On the May 2 episode of SmackDown, Ambrose retained the United States Championship in a fatal four-way match against Alberto Del Rio, Curtis Axel and Ryback.[145]\\r\\nAt Extreme Rules on May 4, The Shield defeated Evolution.[146] The next night on Raw, Ambrose was forced to defend the title in a 20-man battle royal with Rollins and Reigns not part of the match (they were outside the ring all through the match, but were not allowed to interfere) anddespite surviving until the final twolost to Sheamus, thus ending Ambrose's record reign (under the WWE banner) with the United States Championship at 351 days.[147][148] A rematch between The Shield and Evolution was arranged for Payback on June 1, with a stipulation of being No Holds Barred and an elimination match, in which The Shield prevailed again over Evolution with no Shield member being eliminated.[149]\\r\\nOn the June 2 episode of Raw following Payback, Triple H announced his intention to continue Evolution's feud with The Shield, but Batista quit WWE for a second time, officially ending Evolution's feud with The Shield.[150] Later that night with The Shield in the ring, Triple H's \\"plan B\\" for destroying The Shield turned out to be Rollins suddenly attacking Ambrose and Reigns with a steel chair, signalling Rollins' official departure from the group and re-alignment with The Authority while also turning back into a villain in the process.[23] On the June 9 episode of Raw, Rollins described his betrayal as severing a business relationship and that he had destroyed \\"his own creation\\" to further his own interests, while Ambrose and Reigns (still labelled as The Shield)[151] addressed Rollins' betrayal with the former describing Rollins as a \\"cancer\\" in The Shield, while the latter said Rollins \\"committed the most unforgivable sin\\".[152] Later that night, Ambrose and Reigns had what would be their final match as The Shield, teaming up with John Cena to defeat The Wyatt Family.[153]\\r\\nWhile Ambrose and Reigns did not fall out with each other, they did begin to take separate paths as Ambrose declared his intentions to take revenge on Rollins, while Reigns set his sights on the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.[153] While the duo were still referred to as The Shield on the June 13 episode of SmackDown,[154] Ambrose debuted new theme music while no longer wearing The Shield's attire and entering the ring through the traditional entrance on the June 16 episode of Raw,[6][155] while Reigns largely retained The Shield's ring attire and theme music as well as continuing to enter the ring through the live audience, which indicated that Ambrose and Reigns were now working on their own and that The Shield had quietly disbanded.[156][157][158] On the June 24 episode of Main Event, Reigns confirmed that he was on his own and no longer with The Shield, thus confirming that The Shield had dissolved.[159]\\r\\nThroughout July 2017, Ambrose and Rollins teased a potential and partial Shield reunion for several weeks, but Ambrose continuously declined Rollins' offer to reunite, primarily due to trust issues from Rollins' betrayal three years prior.[160][161][162]\\r\\nOn the July 31 episode of Raw, Rollins was confronted by Raw Tag Team Champions Cesaro and Sheamus and later won a match against Sheamus after which Cesaro and Sheamus attacked Rollins before Ambrose came down to make the save, though in the backstage Ambrose told Rollins that he would not help him if Rollins got outnumbered again.[163] The following week on Raw, after Rollins lost a rematch against Sheamus and was once again attacked after the match, Ambrose did not help him and later that night defeated Cesaro only to be subsequently attacked by the duo before being saved by Rollins, leading Ambrose to displayed signs of trust by offering a fist bump, but Rollins ultimately declined.[164][165] This led the two to argue in the ring on the August 14 episode of Raw, which culminated in Ambrose and Rollins brawling with each other only to fight off Cesaro and Sheamus and performing a fist bump to a loud ovation.[166] Raw General Manager Kurt Angle?scheduled a match between Cesaro and Sheamus and Ambrose and Rollins for the?Raw Tag Team Championship?at?SummerSlam on August 20,[167] which Ambrose and Rollins won.[26][168] This also made Ambrose the first member of the group to become a Triple Crown and Grand Slam champion.[169]\\r\\nAt No Mercy on September 24, Ambrose and Rollins made their first successful title defense in a rematch against Cesaro and Sheamus.[170]\\r\\nOn the September 25 episode of?Raw, Reigns was the guest on?Miz TV?for his victory over?John Cena?at No Mercy.[171]?The Miz?took jabs at The Shield and claimed that if he and The Miztourage (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel) were together back when The Shield were, they would have beaten them and after some more arguing a match between the two was scheduled which Reigns won, only to be attacked by The Miz and The Miztourage after the match.[172] The following week on Raw, Reigns was given an Intercontinental Championship match against Miz, but Cesaro and Sheamus got involved in the match and the three mocked Reigns by performing The Shield's triple powerbomb on him, with the show ending on Reigns being approached backstage by Ambrose and Rollins.[173] On the October 9 episode of?Raw, Miz opened the show with Cesaro and Sheamus, but they were interrupted by the officially reunited Shield, who attacked Cesaro and Sheamus and then performed the triple powerbomb on The Miz, leding to a?six-man tag team?Tables, Ladders and Chairs match?between The Shield and the team of Cesaro, The Miz and Sheamus for?TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs.[174] Later that same night, The Shield attacked?Braun Strowman?after Strowman's match against?Matt Hardy and they performed a triple powerbombe on Strowman through the announce table, leading The Miz to request that Strowman should be added to the match, which Angle reluctantly agreed.[7] On the October 16 episode of?Raw, all three members of the newly reformed Shield brought back their original attire, theme song and entrance and during the night Ambrose and Rollins retained the Raw Tag Team Championship against Cesaro and Sheamus while Reigns lost a?steel cage match?to Strowman, allowing a fifth member to be added to The Miz's team after?Kane?made his return by tearing through the ring and attacking Reigns.[175] The Miz then announced Kane as the fifth member for their team while Reigns was pulled out of the match on October 20 over an illness concern and Angle himself would take his place.[176]\\r\\nAt the event on October 22, Ambrose, Rollins and Angle, all dressed in The Shield's ring attire, would go on to win the match after performing a triple powerbomb on The Miz.[177] Due to Reigns illness, he was replaced by Triple H (who also wore the full Shield outfit) during the United Kingdom tour early in November tour as Reigns was still not medically cleared.[178] Ambrose and Rollins were due to face SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos in a non-title interbrand match at Survivor Series,[179] but they lost the title back to Cesaro and Sheamus after SmackDown's The New Day appeared and caused a distraction on the November 6 episode of Raw,[180] thus ending their reign at 78 days.[181] Reigns returned the following week on Raw and The Shield challenged The New Day to a match at Survivor Series on November 19,[182] which they won.[183] Later that same night on Raw, The Shield defeated Cesaro, The Miz and Sheamus in their first official match as a trio since their break up in 2014. [184] On the November 20 episode of Raw, Reigns won the Intercontinental Championship by defeating The Miz following an outside distraction by the other Shield members,[185] making him the second member of The Shield (after Ambrose) to become a Triple Crown and Grand Slam champion.[186]\\r\\nFor the remainder of 2014, Ambrose and Rollins feuded with each other due to Rollins' betrayal and alliance with the Authority, whereas Reigns was quickly inserted into world title contention while John Cena and Ambrose had a short alliance against the likes of the Authority[187][188] Ambrose and Rollins' prolonged feud won Pro Wrestling Illustrated's Feud of the Year award for 2014.[189] At the end of the year, Pro Wrestling Torch writer Shawn Valentino labelled The Shield as a \\"three-headed dragon\\" and the seventh top WWE story of the year and he wrote that The Shield \\"was one of the coolest acts in wrestling in recent years, and most fans believed they were broken up prematurely\\", adding that \\"each member of The Shield has made their mark, and they all look like they will be big stars in the future\\".[190] All three former Shield members main evented a WWE pay-per-view event as a singles competitor within four months of the group's dissolution.[191][192] In addition, Rollins won the 2014 Money in the Bank ladder match[193] and subsequently cashed in his contract to become the WWE World Heavyweight Champion during the main event of WrestleMania 31,[194] while Reigns won the 2015 Royal Rumble match[195] and competed for the world title in the same main event of Rollins' cash in.[196]\\r\\nDespite no longer formally operating as a team, Ambrose and Reigns continued to infrequently work together and maintained an on-screen friendship following The Shield's split.[197][198] On the January 9, 2015 episode of SmackDown, Reigns was about to be put into a handicap match against Rollins and Big Show until Ambrose came to the aid of Reigns and helped defeat them, with the two continuously helping each other against The Authority thereafter.[199] On the May 4 episode of Raw, Ambrose defeated Rollins and (as per pre-stipulation by the Director of Operations Kane) gained his first opportunity for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, being added to the title match at Payback on May 17 and making it a fatal four-way match, also including Reigns and Randy Orton,[200] with the latter being pinned by Rollins.[201] During the match, Ambrose, Reigns and Rollins briefly worked together to perform their signature triple powerbomb on Orton.[202] On May 31, Ambrose faced Rollins at Elimination Chamber, which saw Reigns' involvement after multiple interference by The Authority on Rollins' behalf to help Ambrose, who won by disqualification after Rollins pushed the referee in Ambrose's way as he tried to catch the standing Rollins with his signature diving elbow drop.[203] Despite the win, Ambrose did not gain the championship, but he still took the championship belt with him and challenged Rollins in a ladder match at Money in the Bank on June 14, which he would go on to lose.[204]\\r\\nAfter Rollins suffered legit multiple knee injuries (he tore the ACL, MCL and medial meniscus in his knee while attempting to execute a sunset flip powerbomb) at a live event in Dublin, Ireland on November 4, a tournament was set up to crown a new champion.[205] The tournament began on the November 9 episode of Raw, involving 16 wrestlers and with the final match scheduled for Survivor Series to determine the new champion, while Reigns became the number one contender after winning a fatal four-way match on the October 26 episode of Raw,[206] which led Triple H trying to persuade Reigns into joining The Authority (by doing so, Reigns would have automatically been placed in the championship match), but he refused, thus requiring him to compete in the tournament.[207] On the November 16 episode of Raw, Ambrose, Reigns, Alberto Del Rio and Kevin Owens advanced to the semifinals, setting up ReignsÿDel Rio and OwensÿAmbrose in the semifinals at the event.[208] At Survivor Series on November 22, Ambrose and Reigns won their respective matches and went on to face each other in the main event, in which Reigns defeated Ambrose to win the vacant title only to lose it five minutes, fifteen seconds later to Sheamus, who cashed in his Money in the Bank contract.[209]\\r\\nNearing the end of 2015, Ambrose won the Intercontinental Championship for the first time after defeating Kevin Owens at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 13,[210] while Reigns regained the WWE World Heavyweight Championship after defeating Sheamus on Raw the night after.[211] Reigns lost the WWE World Heavyweight Championship to the returning Triple H after being eliminated at the 2016 Royal Rumble event on January 24 while Ambrose also competed in the Royal Rumble match and was the runner-up, being eliminated last by Triple H.[212] At Fastlane on February 21, Ambrose and Reigns faced each other in a triple threat match also involving Brock Lesnar to face Triple H at WrestleMania 32 for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and when it looked like Ambrose was going to win Reigns hit a spear and came out victorious.[213] On April 3, Reigns defeated Triple H to win the title for a third time.[214]\\r\\nAfter Reigns successfully defended the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against AJ Styles at Extreme Rules on May 22, Rollins returned from injury and attacked Reigns to immediately set his sights on the title he never lost.[215] All three members of The Shield briefly reunited on the June 13 episode of Raw, when Ambrose hosted his Ambrose Asylum segment with Rollins and Reigns as guests in a lead up to their respective matches at Money in the Bank: Ambrose in the Money in the Bank ladder match, Reigns and Rollins in the main event for the championship.[216] At the event on June 19, Ambrose won the Money in the Bank ladder match and Rollins would go on to regain the title in the main event only to lose the title to Ambrose after he successfully cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase, thus all of the former Shield members were world champion on the same night.[217] As a result of the 2016 WWE draft on July 19, Ambrose was drafted to SmackDown while Rollins and Reigns were drafted to Raw, thus ending any possibility of a reunion.[218] All three members of The Shield competed in a triple threat match for the renamed WWE Championship at Battleground on July 24,[219][220] in which Ambrose came out victorious by pinning Reigns in a clean finish.[221]\\r\\nThe Shield members briefly reunited once again (this time with all three men as fan favorites) at Survivor Series on November 20 during its traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match, with Rollins and Reigns on Team Raw and Ambrose on Team SmackDown, when all three members executed their signature triple powerbomb on Ambrose's rival AJ Styles after Ambrose turned on his team to attack Styles.[222] In December 2016, they appeared together at Tribute to the Troops during a backstage segment with The Club (AJ Styles, Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows) and The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods).[223] In April 2017, Ambrose moved to the Raw brand as a result of the Superstar Shake-up, with Rollins and Reigns also staying on Raw.[224] Ambrose and Rollins would eventually reunite in July and won the Raw Tag Team Championship in August (making Ambrose the first member to complete the Triple Crown and Grand Slam), with Reigns also reuniting in October[7] and winning Intercontinential Championship for the first time in November, thus making two out of the three members of the group both a Triple Crown and Grand Slam champions.[186]","input":"Who was the leader of the shield wwe?"},{"output":"on the Gulf of Gonave","context":"Port-au-Prince (/?p??rto??pr?ns/; French pronunciation:??[p??op???s]; Haitian Creole: Ptoprens; Haitian Creole pronunciation:?[p?top???s]) is the capital and most populous city of Haiti. The city's population was estimated at 987,310 in 2015 with the metropolitan area (aire mtropolitaine) estimated at a population of 2,618,894.[2] The metropolitan area is defined by the IHSI as including the communes of Port-au-Prince, Delmas, Cite Soleil, Tabarre, Carrefour, and Ption-Ville.\\r\\nThe city of Port-au-Prince is on the Gulf of Gonave: the bay on which the city lies, which acts as a natural harbor, has sustained economic activity since the civilizations of the Arawaks. It was first incorporated under French colonial rule in 1749. The city's layout is similar to that of an amphitheatre; commercial districts are near the water, while residential neighborhoods are located on the hills above. Its population is difficult to ascertain due to the rapid growth of slums in the hillsides above the city; however, recent estimates place the metropolitan area's population at around 3.7 million, nearly half of the country's national population.[6] The city was catastrophically affected[7] by a devastating earthquake in 2010, with large numbers of structures damaged or destroyed. Haiti's government estimated the death toll to be 230,000.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is said that a captain named de Saint-Andr named the area in 1706, after he sailed into the bay in a ship named Le Prince, hence Port-au-Prince to mean, \\"Port of the Prince.\\" However, the port and the surrounding region continued to be known as H?pital, but the islets in the bay had already been known as Les ?lets du Prince as early as 1680. French colonial commissioner tienne Polverel named the city Port-Rpublicain on 23 September 1793 \\"in order that the inhabitants be kept continually in mind of the obligations which the French Revolution imposed on them.\\" It was later renamed back to Port-au-Prince by Jacques I, Emperor of Haiti.[9]\\r\\nWhen Haiti was divided between a kingdom in the north and a republic in the south, Port-au-Prince was the capital of the republic, under the leadership of Alexandre Ption. Henri Christophe renamed the city Port-aux-Crimes after the assassination of Jacques I at Pont Larnage (now known as Pont-Rouge, and located north of the city).\\r\\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus, the island of Hispaniola was inhabited by people known as the Tano, who arrived in approximately 2600?BC in large dugout canoes. They are believed to come primarily from what is now eastern Venezuela. By the time Columbus arrived in 1492?AD, the region was under the control of Bohechio, Tano cacique (chief) Xaragua.[10] He, like his predecessors, feared settling too close to the coast; such settlements would have proven to be tempting targets for the Caribes, who lived on neighboring islands. Instead, the region served as a hunting ground. The population of the region was approximately 400,000 at the time, but the Tanos were gone within 30 years of the arrival of the Spaniards.[11]\\r\\nWith the arrival of the Spaniards, the Amerindians were forced to accept a protectorate, and Bohechio, childless at death, was succeeded by his sister, Anacaona, wife of the cacique Caonabo. The Spanish insisted on larger tributes.[citation needed] Eventually, the Spanish colonial administration decided to rule directly, and in 1503, Nicolas Ovando, then governor, set about to put an end to the rgime headed by Anacaona. He invited her and other tribal leaders to a feast, and when the Amerindians had drunk a good deal of wine (the Spaniards did not drink on that occasion), he ordered most of the guests killed. Anacaona was spared, only to be hanged publicly some time later. Through violence and murders, the Spanish settlers decimated the native population.\\r\\nDirect Spanish rule over the area having been established, Ovando founded a settlement not far from the coast (west of Etang Saumatre), ironically named Santa Maria de la Paz Verdadera, which would be abandoned several years later. Not long thereafter, Ovando founded Santa Maria del Puerto. The latter was first burned by French explorers in 1535, then again in 1592 by the English. These assaults proved to be too much for the Spanish colonial administration, and in 1606, it decided to abandon the region.\\r\\nFor more than 50 years, the area that is today Port-au-Prince saw its population drop off drastically, when some buccaneers began to use it as a base, and Dutch merchants began to frequent it in search of leather, as game was abundant there. Around 1650, French pirates, or flibustiers, running out of room on the ?le de la Tortue began to arrive on the coast, and established a colony at Trou-Borded. As the colony grew, they set up a hospital not far from the coast, on the Turgeau heights. This led to the region being known as H?pital.\\r\\nAlthough there had been no real Spanish presence in H?pital for well over 50 years, Spain retained its formal claim to the territory, and the growing presence of the French flibustiers on ostensibly Spanish lands provoked the Spanish crown to dispatch Castilian soldiers to H?pital to retake it. The mission proved to be a disaster for the Spanish, as they were outnumbered and outgunned, and in 1697, the Spanish government signed the Treaty of Ryswick, renouncing any claims to H?pital. Around this time, the French also established bases at Ester (part of Petite Rivire) and Gona?ves.\\r\\nEster was a rich village, inhabited by merchants, and equipped with straight streets; it was here that the governor lived. On the other hand, the surrounding region, Petite-Rivire, was quite poor. Following a great fire in 1711, Ester was abandoned. Yet the French presence in the region continued to grow, and soon afterward, a new city was founded to the south, Logane.\\r\\nWhile the first French presence in H?pital, the region later to contain Port-au-Prince was that of the flibustiers; as the region became a real French colony, the colonial administration began to worry about the continual presence of these pirates. While useful in repelling Englishmen intent on encroaching upon French territory, they were relatively independent, unresponsive to orders from the colonial administration, and a potential threat to it. Therefore, in the winter of 1707, Choiseul-Beaupr, the governor of the region sought to get rid of what he saw as a threat. He insisted upon control of the hospital, but the flibustiers refused, considering that humiliating. They proceeded to close the hospital rather than cede control of it to the governor, and many of them became habitans (farmers) the first long-term European inhabitants in the region.\\r\\nAlthough the elimination of the flibustiers as a group from H?pital reinforced the authority of the colonial administration, it also made the region a more attractive target for the English. In order to protect the area, in 1706, a captain named de Saint-Andr sailed into the bay just below the hospital, in a ship named Le Prince. It is said that M. de Saint-Andr named the area Port-au-Prince (meaning \\"Port of the Le Prince\\"), but the port and the surrounding region continued to be known as H?pital, but the islets in the bay had already been known as les ?lets du Prince as early as 1680.\\r\\nThe English did not trouble the area, and various nobles sought land grants from the French crown in H?pital; the first noble to control H?pital was Sieur Joseph Randot. Upon his death in 1737, Sieur Pierre Morel gained control over part of the region, with Gatien Bretton des Chapelles acquiring another portion of it.\\r\\nBy then, the colonial administration was convinced that a capital needed to be chosen, in order to better control the French portion of Hispaniola (Saint-Domingue). For a time, Petit-Goave and Logane vied for this honor, but both were eventually ruled out for various reasons. Neither was centrally located. Petit-Goave's climate caused it to be too malarial, and Logane's topography made it difficult to defend. Thus, in 1749, a new city was built, Port-au-Prince.\\r\\nIn 1770, Port-au-Prince replaced Cap-Fran?ais (the modern Cap-Ha?tien) as capital of the colony of Saint-Domingue.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn November 1791, it was burned in a battle between attacking black revolutionists and defending white plantation owners.[12]\\r\\nIt was captured by British troops on June 4, 1794.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1804, it became the capital of newly independent Ha?ti.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring the American occupation of Haiti (1915ÿ1934), Port-au-Prince, garrisoned by American Marines and Haitian gendarmes, was attacked twice by caco rebels. The first battle, which took place in 1919, was a victory of the American and Haitian government forces, as was the second attack in 1920.\\r\\nOn 12 January 2010, a 7.0 earthquake struck Port-au-Prince, devastating the city. Most of the central historic area of the city was destroyed, including Haiti's prized Cathdrale de Port-au-Prince, the capital building, Legislative Palace (the parliament building), Palace of Justice (Supreme Court building), several ministerial buildings, and at least one hospital.[13] The second floor of the Presidential Palace was thrown into the first floor, and the domes skewed at a severe tilt. The seaport and airport were both damaged, limiting aid shipments. The seaport was severely damaged by the quake[14] and was unable to accept aid shipments for the first week.\\r\\nThe airport's control tower was damaged[15] and the US military had to set up a new control center with generators to get the airport prepared for aid flights. Aid has been delivered to Port-au-Prince by numerous nations and voluntary groups as part of a global relief effort. On Wednesday, January 20, 2010, an aftershock rated at a magnitude of 5.9 caused additional damage.[16]\\r\\nThe worst hurricane season experienced by Haiti occurred in 2008 when four storms Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike negatively impacted Haiti. Nearly 800 people were killed; 22,000 homes were destroyed; 70% of the country's crops were lost, according to reliefweb.org. Then, in 2012, Hurricane Sandy, while not making direct impact, resulted in 75 deaths, $250 million in damage and a resurgence of cholera that was estimated to infected 5,000 people.[17]\\r\\nThe metropolitan area is subdivided into various communes (districts). There is a ring of districts that radiates out from the commune of Port-au-Prince. Ption-Ville is an affluent suburban commune located southeast of the city. Delmas is located directly south of the airport and north of the central city, and the rather poor commune of Carrefour is located southwest of the city.\\r\\nThe commune harbors many low-income slums plagued with poverty and violence in which the most notorious, Cit Soleil, is situated. However, Cit Soleil has been recently split off from Port-au-Prince proper to form a separate commune. The Champ de Mars area has begun some modern infrastructure development as of recently. The downtown area is the site of several projected modernization efforts in the capital.\\r\\nPort-au-Prince has a tropical wet and dry climate and relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. Port-au-Princes wet season runs from March through November, though the city experiences a relative break in rainfall during the month of July. The citys dry season covers the remaining three months. Port-au-Prince generally experiences warm and humid conditions during the dry season and hot and humid conditions during the wet season.\\r\\nThe population of the area was 1,234,742.[19] The majority of the population is of African descent, but a prominent biracial minority controls many of the city's businesses.[citation needed] There are sizable numbers of Hispanic residents, Asians, as well as a number of Europeans (both foreign born and native born).\\r\\nCitizens of Arab (particularly Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian) ancestry are a minority with a presence in the capital.[citation needed] Arab Haitians (a large number of whom live in Port-au-Prince) are more often than not, concentrated in financial areas where the majority of them establish businesses. Most of the biracial residents of the city are concentrated and live within wealthier areas of Port-au-Prince.\\r\\nPort-au-Prince is one of the nation's largest centers of economy and finance. The capital currently exports its most widely consumed produce of coffee and sugar, and has, in the past, exported other goods, such as shoes and baseballs. Port-au-Prince has food-processing plants as well as soap, textile and cement factories. Despite political unrest, the city also relies on the tourism industry and construction companies to move its economy. Port-au-Prince was once a popular place for cruises, but has lost nearly all of its tourism, and no longer has cruise ships coming into port.\\r\\nUnemployment in Port-au-Prince is high, and compounded further by underemployed. Levels of economic activity remain prominent throughout the city, especially among people selling goods and services on the streets. Informal employment is believed to be widespread in Port-au-Prince's slums, as otherwise the population could not survive.[20] Port-au-Prince has several upscale districts in which crime rates are significantly lower than in the city center.[citation needed]\\r\\nPort-au-Prince has a tourism industry. The Toussaint Louverture International Airport (referred to often as the Port-au-Prince International Airport) is the country's main international gateway for tourists. Tourists often visit the Ption-Ville area of Port-au-Prince, with other sites of interest including gingerbread houses.\\r\\nThere are a number of hospitals including le Centre Hospitalier du Sacr-C?ur,[21] H?pital de l'Universit d'tat d'Ha?ti, Centre Obstetrico Gyncologique Isaie Jeanty-Lon Audain, H?pital du Canap-Vert, H?pital Fran?ais (Asile Fran?ais), H?pital Saint-Fran?ois de Sales, H?pital-Maternit Sapiens, H?pital OFATMA, Clinique de la Sant, Maternit de Christ Roi, Centre Hospitalier Rue Berne and Maternit Mathieu.\\r\\nAfter the 2010 earthquake, two hospitals remained that were operational. The University of Miami in partnership with Project Medishare has created a new hospital, L'H?pital Bernard Mevs Project Medishare, to provide inpatient and outpatient care for those impacted by the January 2010 earthquake. This hospital is volunteer staffed and provides level 1 trauma care to Port-au-Prince and the surrounding regions.[22]\\r\\nCDTI (Centre de Diagnostique et de Traitement Intgr) closed in April 2010 when international aid failed to materialize. It had been considered the country's premiere hospital.[23]\\r\\nThe culture of the city lies primarily in the center around the National Palace as well as its surrounding areas. The National Museum is located in the grounds of the palace, established in 1938. The National Palace was one of the early structures of the city but was destroyed and then rebuilt in 1918. It was destroyed again by the earthquake on 12 January 2010 which collapsed the center's domed roof.\\r\\nAnother popular destination in the capital is the Hotel Oloffson, a 19th-century gingerbread mansion that was once the private home of two former Haitian presidents. It has become a popular hub for tourist activity in the central city. The Cathdrale de Port-au-Prince is a famed site of cultural interest and attracts foreign visitors to its Neo-Romantic architectural style.\\r\\nThe Muse d'Art Ha?tien du Collge Saint-Pierre contains work from some of the country's most talented artists, and the Muse National is a museum featuring historical artifacts such as King Henri Christophe's actual suicide pistol and a rusty anchor that museum operators claim was salvaged from Christopher Columbus's ship, the Santa Mara. Other notable cultural sites include the Archives Nationales, the Bibliothque Nationale (National Library) and Expressions Art Gallery. The city is the birthplace of internationally known na?ve artist Gesner Abelard, who was associated with the Centre d'Art.\\r\\nOn April 5, 2015, the construction of a new LDS Temple in Port-au-Prince was announced.[24]\\r\\nThe current mayor of Port-au-Prince is Ralph Youri Chevry, who headed the city at the time of the 2010 earthquake.[25] The city's separate districts (primarily the districts of Delmas, Carrefour, and Ption-Ville) are all administered by their own local mayors who in turn fall under the jurisdiction of the city's general mayor. The seat of the state, the Presidential Palace, is located in the Champ de Mars, square plaza of the city. The PNdH (Police Nationale dHa?ti) is the authority governing the enforcement of city laws.\\r\\nThe national police force as of recently, have been increasing in number. However, because of its ailing ineffectiveness and insufficient manpower, a significant number of UN personnel is present throughout the city as part of the stabilization mission in Haiti.\\r\\nThe City Hall (Mairie de Port-au-Prince) and most of the city's other government municipal buildings were destroyed in the 2010 earthquake.[26]\\r\\nPort-au-Prince various educational institutions, ranging from small vocational schools to universities. Influential international schools in Port-au-Prince include Union School,[27] founded in 1919, and Quisqueya Christian School,[28] founded in 1974. Both schools offer an American-style pre-college education. French-speaking students can attend the Lyce Fran?ais (Lyce Alexandre Dumas), located in Bourdon. Another school is Ans Zun~z Bah' School north west of Port-au-Prince which opened its doors in 1980[29] which survived the 2010 Haiti earthquake[30] and its staff were cooperating in relief efforts and sharing space and support with neighbors.[31]\\r\\nA clinic was run at the school by a medical team from the United States and Canada.[32] Its classes offered transition from Haitian Creole to the French language but also a secondary language in English.[33] The State University of Haiti (Universit d'tat d'Ha?ti in French or UEH), is located within the capital along other universities such as the Quisqueya University and the Universit des Cara?bes. There are many other institutions that observe the Haitian scholastic program. Many of them are religious academies led by foreign missionaries from France or Canada. These include Institution Saint-Louis de Gonzague, cole Sainte-Rose-de-Lima, cole Saint-Jean-Marie Vianney, Institution du Sacr-Coeur, and Collge Anne-Marie Javouhey.\\r\\nThe Ministry of Education is also located in downtown Port-au-Prince at the Palace of Ministries, adjacent to the National Palace in the Champ de Mars plaza.\\r\\nThe Haitian Group of Research and Pedagogical Activities (GHRAP) has set up several community centers for basic education. UNESCO's office at Port-au-Prince has taken a number of initiates in upgrading the educational facilities in Port-au-Prince.\\r\\nA 2012 independent study found that the murder rate in the capital Port-au-Prince was 60.9 murders per 100,000 residents in February 2012.[34] In the 22 months after the end of the President Aristide era in 2004, the murder rate for Port-au-Prince reached a high of 219 murders per 100,000 residents per year.[35]\\r\\nHigh-crime zones in the Port-au-Prince area include Croix-des-Bouquets, Cit Soleil, Carrefour, Bel Air, Martissant, the port road (Boulevard La Saline), urban route Nationale 1, the airport road (Boulevard Toussaint L'Ouverture) and its adjoining connectors to the New (\\"American\\") Road via Route Nationale 1. This latter area in particular has been the scene of numerous robberies, carjackings, and murders.[36]\\r\\nIn the Bel Air neighbourhood of Port-au-Prince, the murder rate reached 50 murders per 100,000 residents at the end of 2011, up from 19 murders per 100,000 residents in 2010.[37]\\r\\nAll of the major transportation systems in Haiti are located near or run through the capital. The northern highway, Route Nationale #1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince. The southern highway, Route Nationale #2 also runs through Port-au-Prince. Maintenance for these roads lapsed after the 1991 coup, prompting the World Bank to lend US$50 million designated for road repairs. The project was canceled in January 1999, however, after auditors revealed corruption.[citation needed] A third major highway, the Haitian Route Nationale #3, which connects Port-au-Prince which links the capital to the central plateau; however, due to its poor condition, it sees limited use.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe most common form of public transportation in Haiti is the use of brightly painted pickup trucks as taxis called \\"tap-taps.\\"\\r\\nThe seaport, Port international de Port-au-Prince, has more registered shipping than any of the over dozen ports in the country.[citation needed] The port's facilities include cranes, large berths, and warehouses, but these facilities are in universally poor shape. The port is underused,[citation needed] possibly due to the substantially high port fees compared to ports in the Dominican Republic.\\r\\nThe Toussaint Louverture International Airport (Aroport International Toussaint Louverture also known as Ma?s Gat), which opened in 1965 (as the Fran?ois Duvalier International Airport), is located north of the city. It is Haiti's major jetway, and as such, handles the vast majority of the country's international flights. Transportation to smaller cities from the major airport is done via smaller aircraft. Companies providing this service include Caribintair and Sunrise Airways.","input":"Where is port au prince located in haiti?"},{"output":"432 Park Avenue","context":"432 Park Avenue is a residential skyscraper in New York City that overlooks Central Park.

It is also the first, and so far only, building in New York City outside the World Trade Center Complex to be taller than the original twin towers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n432 Park Avenue officially topped out on October 10, 2014, at 1,398 feet (426?m)[5][10] making it the second-tallest building in New York City after One World Trade Center and the fifteenth-tallest building in the world.[11] Because much of One World Trade Center's height is in its spire and its base is nearly 40 feet (12?m) lower, the rooftop of 432 Park Ave is, as of 2017[update], the highest in the city.\\r\\nThe tower sits in the middle of the block bound by East 56th Street, Madison Avenue, East 57th Street, and Park Avenue. The building's 100-foot (30?m) base covers most of the 41,000-square-foot (3,800?m2) lot.[12] The tower is a 93-foot (28?m) square in plan, giving each floorplate an occupiable area of 8,255 square feet (766.9?m2).[13] At 15:1, 432 Park has one of the greatest height-to-width ratios of any skyscraper in the world. It is currently the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere.[14]\\r\\nThe design of the structure was conceived by architect Rafael Vi?oly who was inspired by a trash can designed in 1905 by an Austrian designer.[16] The tower has eighty-four 8,255-square-foot (766.9?m2) stories, each with six 100-square-foot (9.3?m2) windows per face. Interiors are designed by Deborah Berke and the firm Bentel & Bentel, which also designed Eleven Madison Park and the Gramercy Tavern.[17] To support its thin orthogonal frame, the structure features larger columns at its base than on the upper floors.[16]\\r\\nThe tower's condominium units feature high ceilings, and range from a 351-square-foot (32.6?m2) studio to an 8,255-square-foot (766.9?m2), six-bedroom, seven-bath penthouse with a library, which sold for $95 million to real estate mogul Fawaz Al Hokair.[18][19][20][21] The building's amenities include 12-foot (3.7?m) golf training facilities and private dining and screening rooms.[22]\\r\\nThe first sale of apartment #35B was reported in January 2016 for $18.116 million, more than the $17.75 million asking price. Ten additional apartments were available at the time ranging from $17.4 to $44.25 million. #35B covers 4,000 square feet (370?m2), one half of the 35th floor of the tower, and contains three bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths. Each face has six 10 by 10?ft (3.0 by 3.0?m) windows, which for #35B, face south and west with views of Central Park.[23][24]\\r\\nThe structure of the tower is composed of a 30-foot (9.1?m) square, reinforced concrete core with 30-inch-thick (76?cm) walls, which the engineer, Silvian Marcus, describes as \\"like the backbone of a body.\\" This core houses the elevator shafts and all the building mechanical services. The outer structural skin is composed of a grid of 3?ft 8?in (1.12?m) wide columns and equal width spandrel (horizontal, exterior) beams of reinforced concrete that encloses the symmetrical \\"basket grid\\" of window openings. The columns begin with a depth of 5?ft 4?in (1.63?m) at the bottom of the tower, to as little as 20?in (51?cm) at the top. This layout permits all of the interior space on each floor to remain fully open for the complete 27 feet (8.2?m) span between the core and shell.[25][26]\\r\\nThe facade, with the formed surface left as the final finish without any added facia, was poured in place from concrete using 14,000 psi white Portland cement, and cast around preassembled full-floor cages of #20 rebars with articulated steel formwork. The floor-to-floor height of each of the 85 stories is 15?ft 6?in (4.72?m), with 10?in (25?cm) thick floor slabs, although to damp the acceleration from wind loads, upper floors have slabs up to 18?in (46?cm) thick to add more mass. Also aimed at reducing the potentially uncomfortable effects of swaying due to wind vortex loading on such a flexible tower, the window grid and interior space of 2 floors between every 12 occupied floors are left open to allow the wind to pass through. These floors also contain modularized mechanical services for the six floors above and below to reduce ductwork. In addition two tuned mass dampers are located at the top of the tower and in the outriggers of some of the mechanical floors to help damp the motion.[26]\\r\\nThe skyscraper has received mixed reviews from both professionals and laymen alike since not everyone agreed with the artistic value of the building.[27][16]\\r\\nGround up view from 56th Street in July 2014\\r\\nUnder construction in March 2015\\r\\n432 Park Avenue on April 1, 2016\\r\\n432 Park Avenue viewed at night\\r\\n432 Park Avenue is the skinniest supertall skyscraper in the world, though a full profile view is blocked by surrounding buildings.\\r\\nTallest buildings in New York City by pinnacle height, including all masts, antennas, poles, etc. 432 Park Avenue is third from the left","input":"What is the tallest residential building in nyc?"},{"output":"saguaro","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saguaro (/s??w?ro?/, Spanish pronunciation:?[sa??wa?o]) (Carnegiea gigantea) is an arborescent (tree-like) cactus species in the monotypic genus Carnegiea, which can grow to be over 40 feet (12?m) tall. It is native to the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, the Mexican State of Sonora, and the Whipple Mountains and Imperial County areas of California. The saguaro blossom is the state wildflower of Arizona. Its scientific name is given in honor of Andrew Carnegie. In 1994, Saguaro National Park, near Tucson, Arizona, was designated to help protect this species and its habitat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe image of the saguaro is indelibly linked with that of the American Southwest, especially in western films.  The common name saguaro came into the English language through the Spanish language, originating in the Mayo language.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaguaros have a relatively long lifespan, often exceeding 150?years. They may grow their first side arm any time from 75ÿ100?years of age, but some never grow any arms. A saguaro without arms is called a spear.  Arms are developed to increase the plant's reproductive capacity, as more apices lead to more flowers and fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe growth rate of saguaros is strongly dependent on precipitation; saguaros in drier western Arizona grow only half as fast as those in and around Tucson. Saguaros grow slowly from seed, never from cuttings, and grow to be over 40 feet (12.2 metres) in height.[3] The largest known living saguaro is the Champion Saguaro growing in Maricopa County, Arizona, measuring 45.3 feet (13.8 metres) high with a girth of 10 feet (3.1 metres). The tallest saguaro ever measured was an armless specimen found near Cave Creek, Arizona.  It was 78 feet (23.8 metres) in height before it was toppled in 1986 by a windstorm.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nA saguaro is able to absorb and store considerable amounts of rainwater, visibly expanding in the process, while slowly using the stored water as needed.  This characteristic enables the saguaro to survive during periods of drought.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen rain is plentiful and the saguaro is fully hydrated it can weigh between 3,200ÿ4,800 pounds (1,500ÿ2,200?kg).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saguaro genome is around 1 billion base pairs long.[5] Sequencing has revealed that the genome of the saguaro's chloroplast is the smallest known among non-parasitic flowering plants.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spines on a saguaro can grow up to 1 millimetre (0.039?in) per day. When held up to the light or bisected, alternating light and dark bands transverse to the long axis of spines can be seen. These transverse bands have been correlated to daily growth. In columnar cacti, spines almost always grow in areoles which originate at the apex of the plant.  A spine stops growing in its first season.  Areoles are moved to the side and the apex continues to grow upwards. Thus, older spines are towards the base of a columnar cactus and newer spines are near the apex. Studies are underway to examine the relationship of carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in the tissues of spines of an individual to its climate and photosynthetic history (acanthochronology).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlowers appear in April through June. They are white and open well after sunset and close in mid-afternoon. They continue to produce nectar after sunrise.[8]\\r\\nFlowers are self-incompatible, thus require cross-pollination.  Large quantities of pollen are required for complete pollination because many ovules are present. This pollen is produced by the extremely numerous stamens which in one case totaled 3,482 in a single flower.[9]  A well-pollinated fruit contains several thousand tiny seeds. Saguaros have a redundant pollination system, i.e. full fruit set is possible even if only a fraction of the pollinating species are present.\\r\\n\\r\\nMain pollinators are honey bees, bats, and white-winged doves. In most years, diurnal visitors are the main contributors for fruit, most of them honey bees. Other diurnal pollinators are birds such as Costa's hummingbird, the black-chinned hummingbird, the broad-billed hummingbird, the hooded oriole, Scott's oriole, the Gila woodpecker, the gilded flicker, the verdin, and the house finch.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main nocturnal pollinator is the lesser long-nosed bat, feeding on the nectar. A number of floral characteristics are geared toward bat pollination: nocturnal opening of the flowers, nocturnal maturation of pollen, very rich nectar, position high above ground, durable blooms that can withstand a bat's weight, and fragrance emitted at night. Further, the amino acids in the pollen appear to help sustain lactation in bats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ruby red fruits are 2.4 to 3.5 inches (6 to 9?cm) long and ripen in June. Each fruit contains around 2,000 seeds plus sweet fleshy connective tissue. The fruits are edible and prized by local people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fruits cannot be picked by hand, but must be harvested using a pole (often a saguaro rib) 7 to 16 feet (2 to 5?m) long, to the end of which is attached another pole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe O'odham tribes have a long history of saguaro fruit use.[11] The Tohono Oodham tribes celebrate the beginning of their summer growing season with a ceremony using a fermented drink made from the bright red fruit to summon rains, vital for the crops.\\r\\n\\r\\nNative birds such as Gila woodpeckers, purple martins, house finches, and gilded flickers live inside holes in saguaros. Flickers excavate larger holes higher on the stem.[12]  The nest cavity is deep, and the parents and young are entirely hidden from view.  The saguaro creates callus tissue on the wound.  When the saguaro dies and its soft flesh rots, the callus remains as a so-called saguaro boot, which was used by natives for storage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gila woodpeckers (Melanerpes uropygialis) create new nest holes each season rather than reuse the old ones, leaving convenient nest holes for other birds, such as elf owls, flycatchers, and wrens.[13] In recent years, early-breeding, aggressive, non-native birds have taken over the nests to the detriment of elf owls that breed and nest later.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarming a saguaro in any manner, including cactus plugging, is illegal by state law in Arizona, and when houses or highways are built, special permits must be obtained to move or destroy any saguaro affected.[14] Exceptions to this general understanding exist; for example, a private landowner whose property is 10 acres (4.0?ha) or less, where the initial construction has already occurred, may remove a saguaro from the property.[15] This is common when the cactus falls over in a storm, its location interferes with a house addition, or it becomes a potential hazard to humans.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary to published statements,[17] there is no law mandating prison sentences of 25 years for cutting a cactus down; however it is considered a class four felony with a possible 3 year, 9 month maximum sentence.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saguaro is often used as an emblem in commercials and logos that attempt to convey a sense of the Southwest, even if the product has no connection to Arizona or the Sonoran Desert. For instance, no naturally occurring saguaros are found within 250?miles (400?km) of El Paso, Texas, but the silhouette is found on the label of Old El Paso brand products.[19][20] Though the geographic anomaly has lessened in recent years, Western films once enthusiastically placed saguaros in the Monument Valley of Arizona, as well as New Mexico, Utah, and Texas. The Dallas, Texas-based band, Reverend Horton Heat, pokes fun at this phenomenon in their song \\"Ain't no Saguaro in Texas\\".[21] No wild saguaros are found anywhere in New Mexico,  Texas, Colorado, Utah, or Nevada, nor in the high deserts of northern Arizona.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaguaro silhouette at sunset\\r\\n\\r\\nSaguaro towering over a 6-ft man\\r\\n\\r\\nMature five-armed in flower\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow-covered saguaro near Tucson.

He was the longest held American prisoner of war in U.S. history, spending nearly nine years in captivity in the jungle camps and mountains of South Vietnam and Laos, and in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Thompson was born July 8, 1933, in Bergenfield, New Jersey, as the son of a bus driver. He graduated from Bergenfield High School in 1951.[1] Thompson worked for the A&P supermarket [2]:19 before he was drafted by the United States Army on June 14, 1956.[2]:28 He was at first a very truculent, rebellious soldier, but then decided that he liked the military. After basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, he decided to make the military his career.\\r\\nAfter completing Officer Candidate School,[2]:32 Thompson served stateside and also spent a year in Korea.[2]:37 He was stationed at Fort Bragg when he was recruited into the Army Special Forces as a Green Beret.[2]:41 After completing Ranger School and Jump School, he served as an instructor with the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, from August 1958 to June 1960. His next assignment was as a Platoon Leader in the 2nd Brigade of the 34th Infantry Regiment, stationed in South Korea from June 1960 to July 1961. Thompson then served as a reenlistment officer with Headquarters XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, from September 1961 to September 1962, and then as a staff officer with 1st Special Forces at Fort Bragg, from September 1962 to December 1963.[3]\\r\\nCaptain Thompson went to Vietnam in December 1963.[2]:52 Prior to his deployment, he hadn't heard of the country. He was to serve only a six-month tour of duty but was captured on March 26, 1964. He was released on March 16, 1973, 10 days short of 9 years.\\r\\nOn March 26, 1964, Thompson was a passenger on an observation plane (an L-19/O-1 Bird Dog) flown by Captain Richard L. Whitesides when it was downed by enemy small arms fire at 163912N 1064621E? / ?16.65333N 106.77250E? / 16.65333; 106.77250, about 20 kilometers from Thompson's Special Forces Camp near Quang Tri, South Vietnam.\\r\\nThompson survived the crash with burns, a bullet wound across the cheek, and a broken back. He was quickly captured by the Viet Cong. Whitesides was never found; he was awarded the Air Force Cross for a previous mission but was killed before it could be presented to him. He was the first American to be killed in action at Khe Sanh, South Vietnam.[4]\\r\\nAerial search and ground patrols failed to find any trace of the aircraft.[2]:94\\r\\nOn March 27, 1964, an Army officer visited Thompson's home and told his pregnant wife Alyce that he was missing. The trauma sent her into labor and their son was born that evening.\\r\\nThompson spent the next nine years (3,278 days) as a prisoner of war, first at the hands of the Viet Cong in the South Vietnam jungles, until he was moved in 1967 to the Hanoi prison system.[5] During his captivity, he was tortured, starved, and isolated from other American POWs.[6] At one point, Thompson did not speak to another American for over five years. He was released with the other POWs in mid-March 1973 in Operation Homecoming.\\r\\nHowever, the year following Thompson's release were not happy ones. His troubled life was chronicled in an oral biography called Glory Denied by Tom Philpott. Although Thompson was promoted to lieutenant colonel upon release and then to full colonel, he had missed the most important years of his military career while in prison. He had no formal military education beyond OCS and lacked even a college degree or experience as a company commander.[2]:295\\r\\nHe had difficulty adjusting to a vastly changed peacetime Army. In addition, Thompson's marriage had been troubled even before his captivity, and his wife Alyce, believing him dead, was living with another man at the time he was repatriated. He and his wife divorced in 1975. Alyce told author Tom Philpott that she believed prison had affected her husband's mind. She said he suffered from nightmares and was abusive towards both her and the children.[7] Thompson later remarried but divorced soon afterwards. Thompson never formed any kind of a relationship with his children. His daughters were 6, 5 and 4 when he left, and his son was born the day of his capture. Only his eldest child barely remembered him. He eventually became completely estranged from all of them.\\r\\nSadly, Thompson said that one of the things that helped him cope with his brutal imprisonment was thinking of the fine family that awaited his return. He developed a very serious drinking problem and was in several military hospitals for treatment.[2]:349\\r\\nIn 1977, Thompson attempted suicide with an overdose of pills and alcohol.[2]:430 His superiors told author Philpott that had it not been for Thompson's status as a hero, he would have been dismissed from service because of his alcoholism. In 1981, while still on active duty, Thompson suffered a massive heart attack and a severe stroke. He was in a coma for months and was left seriously disabled. He was paralyzed on one side and could speak only in brief phrases for the rest of his life.\\r\\nThe stroke that left Thompson's left side paralyzed[2]:431 and his age contributed to his forced retirement from active duty in the Army. A ceremony was held for him in The Pentagon on January 28, 1982. Thompson received the Distinguished Service Medal in appreciation for his 25 years of service to his country as an Army officer.[8] Because of his recent stroke, he had a hard time speaking, so Michael Chamowitz, his close friend and lawyer, read his retirement speech.\\r\\nIn 1981, Thompson moved to Key West, where he remained active in the community, according to the Monroe County Office of Veterans Affairs. In 1988, Thompson and a number of other former prisoners of war were awarded medals by President Ronald Reagan.\\r\\nIn 1990, Thompson's son Jim was convicted of murder and imprisoned for sixteen years.[10]\\r\\nOn July 8, 2002, the staff of JIATF (Joint Interagency Task Force) East and some of his close friends threw Thompson a birthday party. He was described as being in high spirits and full of excitement. During the celebration, he quoted General Douglas MacArthur: \\"Old soldiers never die, they just fade away.\\"\\r\\nEight days later, Thompson was found dead in his Key West By the Sea Condominium on July 16, 2002, at the age of 69. His body was cremated, and his ashes scattered at sea off the coast of Florida. There is a memorial marker for him at Andersonville National Cemetery.\\r\\nIn an update to Glory Denied, Tom Philpott reported that Alyce Thompson died of cancer in 2009. He also mentioned that Thompson's daughter Ruth had suffered three disabling heart attacks and had lost a son to suicide. Philpott reported that Ruth had told him the strength of character that she inherited from both her parents had helped her though the difficult times. Glory Denied was later turned into an opera.\\r\\nOn November 2014, Thompson's pilot Richard L. Whitesides' remains were recovered in the area where he was lost on March 26, 1964 and have been identified. They were returned to his family for burial with full military honors at West Point Cemetery.[11]\\r\\nIn October 1974, Thompson started to receive medals and awards in recognition for his service and sacrifice in Vietnam. South Vietnam was the first to honor Thompsons service and sacrifice with the countrys highest award to Allied enlisted military personnel for valor, the Republic of Vietnam Military Merit Medal, the Vietnamese equivalent to the United States Medal of Honor.[12]\\r\\nIn recognition of his escape from Viet Cong POW camp for two days in October 1971, Thompson received the Silver Star.[2] For his nine years in captivity, Thompson received the Army Distinguished Service Medal, Bronze Star Medal, and Legion of Merit. The Bronze Star recognized his continuous resistance to the enemy. The Legion of Merit recognized his suffering for his nine years in captivity.[2]\\r\\nA ceremony was held on June 24, 1988, in the White House honoring POWs from World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Two representatives were picked from each war to receive the Prisoner of War Medal. Thompson and Everett Alvarez were chosen to represent POWs from Vietnam.[13]\\r\\nHis military decorations and awards include:","input":"Who was the longest held pow in vietnam?"},{"output":"54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition","context":"Africa is the world's second largest and second most-populous continent (the first being Asia in both categories). At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square?miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its total land area.[3] With 1.2 billion people[1] as of 2016, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.[4] The majority of the continent and its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere.\\r\\nAfrica's average population is the youngest amongst all the continents;[5][6] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[7] Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors as well as later ones that have been dated to around 7 million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergasterwith the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.[8] Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.[9]\\r\\nAfrica hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century, European countries colonised almost all of Africa; most present states in Africa originated from a process of decolonisation in the 20th century. African nations cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).[10][11] This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician ?afar 'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis[12] has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) \\"cave\\", in reference to cave dwellers.[13] The same word[13] may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.[14]\\r\\nUnder Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.[15] The Latin suffix -ica can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, located in modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.\\r\\nAccording to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while \\"Asia\\" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85ÿ165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of \\"Africa\\" expanded with their knowledge.\\r\\nOther etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name \\"Africa\\":\\r\\nAfrica is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on Earth, with the human species originating from the continent.[19][20] During the mid-20th century, anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (BP=before present). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man, such as Australopithecus afarensis (radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9ÿ3.0?million years BP,[21] Paranthropus boisei (c. 2.3ÿ1.4?million years BP)[22] and Homo ergaster (c. 1.9?millionÿ600,000 years BP) have been discovered.[3]\\r\\nAfter the evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years BP in Africa, the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers.[23][24][25] These first modern humans left Africa and populated the rest of the globe during the Out of Africa II migration dated to approximately 50,000 years BP, exiting the continent either across Bab-el-Mandeb over the Red Sea,[26][27] the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco,[28] or the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt.[29]\\r\\nOther migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern Africa, Southeast Africa, North Africa, and the Sahara.[30]\\r\\nThe size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.[31] At the end of the Ice ages, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in Sub-Saharan Africa, with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in Tassili n'Ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia.[32] However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.[33] The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.\\r\\nThe domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.[34] In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia.\\r\\nAround 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.[35] This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa.[35]\\r\\nBy the first millennium BC, ironworking had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,[36] and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. Copper objects from Egypt, North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that Trans-Saharan trade networks had been established by this date.[35]\\r\\nAt about 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Northern Africa with the rise of literacy in the Pharaonic civilization of Ancient Egypt.[37] One of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, the Egyptian state continued, with varying levels of influence over other areas, until 343 BC.[38][39] Egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day Libya and Nubia, and, according to Martin Bernal, as far north as Crete.[40]\\r\\nAn independent centre of civilization with trading links to Phoenicia was established by Phoenicians from Tyre on the north-west African coast at Carthage.[41][42][43]\\r\\nEuropean exploration of Africa began with Ancient Greeks and Romans.[citation needed] In 332 BC, Alexander the Great was welcomed as a liberator in Persian-occupied Egypt. He founded Alexandria in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty after his death.[44]\\r\\nFollowing the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the Roman Empire, the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. Roman settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first Roman emperor native to North Africa was Septimius Severus, born in Leptis Magna in present-day Libyahis mother was Italian Roman and his father was Punic.[45]\\r\\nChristianity spread across these areas at an early date, from Judaea via Egypt and beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia;[46] by AD 340 at the latest, it had become the state religion of the Aksumite Empire. Syro-Greek missionaries, who arrived by way of the Red Sea, were responsible for this theological development.[47]\\r\\nIn the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to Qayrawan in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.[48]\\r\\nPre-colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities[50] characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule. These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the San people of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu-speaking peoples of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of Africa; the large Sahelian kingdoms; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the Akan; Edo, Yoruba, and Igbo people in West Africa; and the Swahili coastal trading towns of Southeast Africa.\\r\\nBy the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest Hausa states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire. Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.\\r\\nIn the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north. The Kingdom of Nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes, found at the town of Igbo-Ukwu. The bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century.[51]\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Ife, historically the first of these Yoruba city-states or kingdoms, established government under a priestly oba ('king' or 'ruler' in the Yoruba language), called the Ooni of Ife. Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture. The Ife model of government was adapted at the Oyo Empire, where its obas or kings, called the Alaafins of Oyo, once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.\\r\\nThe Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century.[52] The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers, where the locals were Arabized,[53] and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of Islam.[54]\\r\\nFollowing the breakup of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464ÿ1492) founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493ÿ1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.[55] By the eleventh century, some Hausa states ÿ such as Kano, jigawa, Katsina, and Gobir ÿ had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.\\r\\nMansa Musa ruled the Mali Empire in the 14th century.[56]\\r\\nSlavery had long been practiced in Africa.[57][58] Between the 7th and 20th centuries, Arab slave trade (also known as slavery in the East) took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean routes. Between the 15th and the 19th centuries, the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7ÿ12 million slaves to the New World.[59][60][61] More than 1 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa between the 16th and 19th centuries.[62]\\r\\nIn West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.[63]\\r\\nAction was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against \\"the usurping King of Lagos\\", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.[64] The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of \\"legitimate commerce\\" in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.[65]\\r\\nIn the late 19th century, the European imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: Ethiopia (known to Europeans as \\"Abyssinia\\"), and Liberia. Egypt and Sudan were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922.\\r\\nThe Berlin Conference held in 1884ÿ85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King Leopold II of Belgium, and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. The Berlin Conference sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.\\r\\nImperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France.[66] Ghana followed suit the next year (March 1957),[67] becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.\\r\\nPortugal's overseas presence in Sub-Saharan Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and S?o Tom and Prncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, under the white minority government of Ian Smith, but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as Zimbabwe) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war. Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994.\\r\\nToday, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.\\r\\nGreat instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups, and graft under these leaders. For political gain, many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.\\r\\nCold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the policies of the International Monetary Fund,[citation needed] also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers. Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In Rhodesia, Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the Zimbabwe Patriotic Front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the country's white government. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.[68][69][70] The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War; this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people.[71] Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster. Another notable tragic event is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. AIDS in post-colonial Africa has also been a prevalent issue.\\r\\nIn the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China,[72] which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2016. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as Africa Rising, can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.[73]\\r\\nAfrica is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the Earth. Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea, it is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (transected by the Suez Canal), 163?km (101?mi) wide.[74] (Geopolitically, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula east of the Suez Canal is often considered part of Africa, as well.)[75]\\r\\nThe coastline is 26,000?km (16,000?mi) long, and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is illustrated by the fact that Europe, which covers only 10,400,000?km2 (4,000,000?sq?mi) ÿ about a third of the surface of Africa ÿ has a coastline of 32,000?km (20,000?mi).[76] From the most northerly point, Ras ben Sakka in Tunisia (3721' N), to the most southerly point, Cape Agulhas in South Africa (3451'15\\" S), is a distance of approximately 8,000?km (5,000?mi).[77] Cape Verde, 1733'22\\" W, the westernmost point, is a distance of approximately 7,400?km (4,600?mi) to Ras Hafun, 5127'52\\" E, the most easterly projection that neighbours Cape Guardafui, the tip of the Horn of Africa.[76]\\r\\nAfrica's largest country is Algeria, and its smallest country is Seychelles, an archipelago off the east coast.[78] The smallest nation on the continental mainland is The Gambia.\\r\\nThe African Plate is a major tectonic plate straddling the equator as well as the prime meridian. It includes much of the continent of Africa, as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges. Between 60?million years ago and 10?million years ago, the Somali Plate began rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift.[80] Since the continent of Africa consists of crust from both the African and the Somali plates, some literature refers to the African Plate as the Nubian Plate to distinguish it from the continent as a whole.[81]\\r\\nGeologically, Africa includes the Arabian Peninsula; the Zagros Mountains of Iran and the Anatolian Plateau of Turkey mark where the African Plate collided with Eurasia. The Afrotropic ecozone and the Saharo-Arabian desert to its north unite the region biogeographically, and the Afro-Asiatic language family unites the north linguistically.\\r\\nThe climate of Africa ranges from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily desert, or arid, while its central and southern areas contain both savanna plains and dense jungle (rainforest) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as sahel and steppe dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.[82] The record for the highest-ever recorded temperature, in Libya in 1922 (58?C (136?F)), was discredited in 2013.[83][84]\\r\\nAfrica boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and \\"range of freedom\\" of wild animal populations and diversity, with wild populations of large carnivores (such as lions, hyenas, and cheetahs) and herbivores (such as buffalo, elephants, camels, and giraffes) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of \\"jungle\\" animals including snakes and primates and aquatic life such as crocodiles and amphibians. In addition, Africa has the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna.\\r\\nAfrica has over 3,000 protected areas, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity and arable land. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.[82]\\r\\nDeforestation is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).[85] According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center, 31% of Africa's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world.[82] Some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in West Africa have been destroyed.[86] Over 90% of Madagascar's original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago.[87] About 65% of Africa's agricultural land suffers from soil degradation.[88]\\r\\nThere are clear signs of increased networking among African organizations and states. For example, in the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (former Zaire), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, neighbouring African countries became involved (see also Second Congo War). Since the conflict began in 1998, the estimated death toll has reached 5 million.\\r\\nThe African Union (AU) is a 55-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states. The union was formed, with Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002[89] as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South Africa, but the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.\\r\\nThe African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union, which aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan-African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.\\r\\nPolitical associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and C?te d'Ivoire.\\r\\nAlthough it has abundant natural resources, Africa remains the world's poorest and most underdeveloped continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide).[90] According to the United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.[91]\\r\\nPoverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent. In August 2008, the World Bank[92] announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). 80.5% of the Sub-Saharan Africa population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 85.7% for India.[93]\\r\\nSub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973,[94] indicating increasing poverty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.[95][96][97]\\r\\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity. The continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite,[98] 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium.[99] The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves.[100] Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite.[101] As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis pushed 100 million people into food insecurity.[102]\\r\\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.[72]\\r\\nA Harvard University study led by professor Calestous Juma showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. \\"African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity.\\"[103]\\r\\nDuring US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a US$7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new programme named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US.[104]\\r\\nAfrica's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young. In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age.[105] The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990.[106] As of 2016, the population of Africa is estimated at 1.2 billion[1]. Africa's total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; African population surpassed Europe in the 1990s, while the Americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000; Africa's rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population, at roughly the same time ÿ India and China's 1.4 billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022.[107]\\r\\nSpeakers of Bantu languages (part of the NigerÿCongo family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu-speaking peoples from the Sahel progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.[108] But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan (\\"San\\" or \\"Bushmen\\") and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also \\"San\\", closely related to, but distinct from \\"Hottentots\\") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.[109]\\r\\nThe peoples of West Africa primarily speak NigerÿCongo languages, belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The NigerÿCongo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa.\\r\\nThe peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo- European Greeks, Romans, and Vandals settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and Algeria in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.[110] The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and NigerÿCongo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the Horn of Africa, some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the Amhara and Tigrayans, collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic.\\r\\nPrior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.[111] Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers ÿ especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million pieds-noirs in North Africa),[112] Kenya, Congo,[113] Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.[114] Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone.[115] Nevertheless, white Africans remain an important minority in many African states, particularly Zimbabwe, Namibia, Runion, and the Republic of South Africa.[116] The country with the largest white African population is South Africa.[117] Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.[118]\\r\\nEuropean colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese[72] have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively.[119]\\r\\nBy most estimates, well over a thousand languages (UNESCO has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.[120] Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major language families indigenous to Africa:\\r\\nFollowing the end of colonialism, nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (see African French) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portuguese, Afrikaans and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in Africa. German is spoken in Namibia, as it was a former German protectorate.\\r\\nSome aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.[122] Leopold II of Belgium attempted to \\"civilize\\" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.[122]\\r\\nObidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art.[123] According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, \\"The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art.\\" [124] Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects \\"lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions.[124] Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that \\"the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art.\\" [125] In Soweto, the West Rand Administrative Board established a Cultural Section to collect, read, and review scripts before performances could occur.[126][self-published source] Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the \\"traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe.\\" [127] On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)asset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies.\\" [128]\\r\\nThere is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the African Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, Afrocentrism, led by a group of scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality.\\r\\nAfrican art and architecture reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known beads were made from Nassarius shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.[129] The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt was the world's tallest structure for 4,000 years, until the completion of Lincoln Cathedral around the year 1300. The stone ruins of Great Zimbabwe are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the monolithic churches at Lalibela, Ethiopia, such as the Church of Saint George.\\r\\nEgypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the Atlantic slave trade to modern samba, blues, jazz, reggae, hip hop, and rock. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of Afrobeat and Highlife music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous, dominated by the music of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of North Africa and Southern Africa. Arab influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, Western influences are apparent due to colonization.\\r\\nFifty-four African countries have football (soccer) teams in the Confederation of African Football. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups. South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup tournament, becoming the first African country to do so.\\r\\nCricket is popular in some African nations. South Africa and Zimbabwe have Test status, while Kenya is the leading non-test team and previously had One-Day International cricket (ODI) status (from 10 October 1997, until 30 January 2014). The three countries jointly hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Namibia is the other African country to have played in a World Cup.

Along with his collaborator Thodore Simon, Binet published revisions of his test in 1908 and 1911, the last of which appeared just before his death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBinet attended law school in Paris, and received his degree in 1878. He also studied physiology at the Sorbonne. His first formal position was as a researcher at a neurological clinic, Salptrire Hospital, in Paris from 1883ÿ1889. From there, Binet went on to being a researcher and associate director of the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology at the Sorbonne from 1891ÿ1894. In 1894, he was promoted to being the director of the laboratory until 1911 (his death). Binet also educated himself by reading psychology texts at the National Library in Paris. He soon became fascinated with the ideas of John Stuart Mill, who believed that the operations of intelligence could be explained by the laws of associationism. Binet eventually realized the limitations of this theory, but Mill's ideas continued to influence his work.\\r\\nIn 1883, years of unaccompanied study ended when Binet was introduced to Charles Fr, who introduced him to Jean-Martin Charcot, the director of a clinic called La Salptrire, Paris. Charcot became his mentor and in turn, Binet accepted a job offer at the clinic, working in his neurological laboratory. At the time of Binet's tenure, Charcot was experimenting with hypnotism. Binet was strongly influenced by Charcot, and published four articles about his work in this area. Unfortunately, Charcot's conclusions did not hold up under professional scrutiny, and Binet was forced to make an embarrassing public admission that he had been wrong in supporting his teacher. Nevertheless, he had established his name internationally in the field, Morton Prince for example stating in 1904 that \\"certain problems in subconscious automatism will always be associated with the names of Breuer and Freud in Germany, Janet and Alfred Binet in France\\".[3]\\r\\nWhen his involvement with hypnosis waned as a result of failure to establish professional acceptance, he turned to the study of development spurred on by the birth of his two daughters, Marguerite and Armande (born in 1885 and 1887, respectively), calling Armande a subjectivist and Marguerite an objectivist, and developing the concepts of introspection and externospection in an anticipation of Carl Jung's psychological types.[4] In the 21-year period following his shift in career interests, Binet \\"published more than 200 books, articles, and reviews in what now would be called experimental, developmental, educational, social, and differential psychology\\" (Siegler, 1992). Bergin and Cizek (2001) suggest that this work may have influenced Jean Piaget, who later studied with Binet's collaborator Thodore Simon in 1920. Binet's research with his daughters helped him to further refine his developing conception of intelligence, especially the importance of attention span and suggestibility in intellectual development.\\r\\nDespite Binet's extensive research interests and wide breadth of publications, today he is most widely known for his contributions to intelligence. Wolf (1973) postulates that this is the result of his not being affiliated with a major university. Because Binet did not have any formalized graduate study in psychology, he did not hold a professorship with a prestigious institution where students and funds would be sure to perpetuate his work (Siegler, 1992). Additionally, his more progressive theories did not provide the practical utility that his intelligence scale would evoke.\\r\\nBinet and his coworker Fere discovered what they called transfer and they also recognized perceptual and emotional polarization. Binet and Fere thought their findings were a phenomenon and of utmost importance. After investigations by many, the two men were forced to admit that they were wrong about their concepts of transfer and polarization. Basically, their patients had known what was expected, what was supposed to happen, and so they simply assented. Binet had risked everything on his experiment and its results, and this failure took a toll on him.\\r\\nIn 1890, Binet resigned from La Salptrire and never mentioned the place or its director again. His interests then turned towards the development of his children, Madeleine and Alice, who were two years apart. This research presages that done by Jean Piaget just a short time later, regarding the development of cognition in children.\\r\\nA job presented itself for Binet in 1891 at the Laboratory of Physiological Psychology at the Sorbonne. He worked for a year without pay and by 1894, he took over as the director. This was a position that Binet held until his death, and it enabled him to pursue his studies on mental processes. While directing the Laboratory, Theodore Simon applied to do doctoral research under Binet's supervision. This was the beginning of their long, fruitful collaboration. During this time he also co-founded the French journal of psychology, L'Annee psychologique, serving as the director and editor-in-chief of the journal that was the first scientific journal in this domain.\\r\\nIn 1899, Binet was asked to be a member of the Free Society for the Psychological Study of the Child. French education changed greatly during the end of the nineteenth century, because of a law that passed which made it mandatory for children ages six to fourteen to attend school. This group to which Binet became a member hoped to begin studying children in a scientific manner. Binet and many other members of the society were appointed to the Commission for the Retarded. The question became \\"What should be the test given to children thought to possibly have learning disabilities, that might place them in a special classroom?\\" Binet made it his problem to establish the differences that separate the normal child from the abnormal, and to measure such differences. L'Etude experimentale de l'intelligence (Experimental Studies of Intelligence) was the book he used to describe his methods and it was published in 1903.\\r\\nDevelopment of more tests and investigations began soon after the book, with the help of a young medical student named Theodore Simon. Simon had nominated himself a few years before as Binet's research assistant and worked with him on the intelligence tests that Binet is known for, which share Simon's name as well. In 1905, a new test for measuring intelligence was introduced and simply called the BinetÿSimon scale. In 1908, they revised the scale, dropping, modifying, and adding tests and also arranging them according to age levels from three to thirteen.\\r\\nIn 1904 a French professional group for child psychology, La Socit Libre pour l'Etude Psychologique de l'Enfant, was called upon by the French government to appoint a commission on the education of retarded children. The commission was asked to create a mechanism for identifying students in need of alternative education. Binet, being an active member of this group, found the impetus for the development of his mental scale.\\r\\nBinet and Simon, in creating what historically is known as the Binet-Simon Scale, comprised a variety of tasks they thought were representative of typical children's abilities at various ages. This task-selection process was based on their many years of observing children in natural settings. They then tested their measurement on a sample of fifty children, ten children per five age groups. The children selected for their study were identified by their school teachers as being average for their age. The purpose of this scale of normal functioning, which would later be revised twice using more stringent standards, was to compare children's mental abilities relative to those of their normal peers (Siegler, 1992).\\r\\nThe scale consisted of thirty tasks of increasing difficulty. The easier ones could be done by everyone. Some of the simplest test items assessed whether or not a child could follow a beam of light or talk back to the examiner. Slightly harder tasks required children to point to various named body parts, repeat back a series of 2 digits, repeat simple sentences, and define words like house, fork or mama. More difficult test items required children to state the difference between pairs of things, reproduce drawings from memory or to construct sentences from three given words such as \\"Paris, river and fortune.\\" The hardest test items included asking children to repeat back 7 random digits, find three rhymes for the French word \\"obisance\\" and to answer questions such as \\"My neighbor has been receiving strange visitors. He has received in turn a doctor, a lawyer, and then a priest. What is taking place?\\" (Fancher, 1985).\\r\\nFor the practical use of determining educational placement, the score on the Binet-Simon scale would reveal the child's mental age. For example, a 6-year-old child who passed all the tasks usually passed by 6 year-oldsbut nothing beyondwould have a mental age that exactly matched his chronological age, 6.0. (Fancher, 1985).\\r\\nBinet was forthright about the limitations of his scale. He stressed the remarkable diversity of intelligence and the subsequent need to study it using qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, measures. Binet also stressed that intellectual development progressed at variable rates and could be influenced by the environment; therefore, intelligence was not based solely on genetics, was malleable rather than fixed, and could only be found in children with comparable backgrounds (Siegler, 1992). Given Binet's stance that intelligence testing was subject to variability and was not generalizable, it is important to look at the metamorphosis that mental testing took on as it made its way to the U.S.\\r\\nWhile Binet was developing his mental scale, the business, civic, and educational leaders in the U.S. were facing issues of how to accommodate the needs of a diversifying population, while continuing to meet the demands of society. There arose the call to form a society based on meritocracy (Siegler,1992) while continuing to underline the ideals of the upper class. In 1908, H.H. Goddard, a champion of the eugenics movement, found utility in mental testing as a way to evidence the superiority of the white race. After studying abroad, Goddard brought the Binet-Simon Scale to the United States and translated it into English.\\r\\nFollowing Goddard in the U.S. mental testing movement was Lewis Terman, who took the Simon-Binet Scale and standardized it using a large American sample. The new Stanford-Binet scale was no longer used solely for advocating education for all children, as was Binet's objective. A new objective of intelligence testing was illustrated in the Stanford-Binet manual with testing ultimately resulting in \\"curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness and in the elimination of an enormous amount of crime, pauperism, and industrial inefficiency\\".[5]\\r\\nIt follows that we should question why Binet did not speak out concerning the newfound uses of his measure. Siegler (1992) pointed out that Binet was somewhat of an isolationist in that he never traveled outside France and he barely participated in professional organizations. Additionally, his mental scale was not adopted in his own country during his lifetime and therefore was not subjected to the same fate. Finally, when Binet did become aware of the \\"foreign ideas being grafted on his instrument\\" he condemned those who with 'brutal pessimism' and 'deplorable verdicts' were promoting the concept of intelligence as a single, unitary construct (White, 2000).\\r\\nHe did a lot of studies of children. His experimental subjects ranged from 3 to 18 years old. Binet published the third version of the Binet-Simon scale shortly before his death in 1911. The Binet-Simon scale was and is hugely popular around the world, mainly because of the vast literature it has fostered, as well as its relative ease of administration.\\r\\nSince his death, many people in many ways have honored Binet, but two of these stand out. In 1917, the Free Society for the Psychological Study of the Child, of which Binet became a member in 1899 and which prompted his development of the intelligence tests, changed their name to La Socit Alfred Binet, in memory of the renowned psychologist. The second honor was not until 1984, when the journal Science 84 picked the Binet-Simon scale as one of twenty of the century's most significant developments or discoveries.\\r\\nHe studied sexual behavior, coining the term erotic fetishism to describe individuals whose sexual interests in nonhuman objects, such as articles of clothing,[6] and linking this to the after-effects of early impressions in an anticipation of Freud.[7]\\r\\nHe also studied abilities of Valentine Dencausse, the most famous chiromancer in Paris in those days.\\r\\nBinet had done a series of experiments to see how well chess players played when blindfolded.[8] He found that only some of the master chess players could play from memory and a few could play multiple games simultaneously without looking at the boards. To remember the positions of the pieces on the boards, some players envisioned exact replicas of specific chess sets, while others envisioned an abstract schema of the game. Binet concluded that extraordinary feats of memory such as blind chess playing could take a variety of mnemonic forms. He recounted his experiments in a book entitled Psychologie des grands calculateurs et joueurs en echec (Paris: Hachette, 1894).[9]\\r\\nAlfred Binet was one of the founding editors of L'anne psychologique, a yearly volume comprising original articles and reviews of the progress of psychology still in print.","input":"What was the original purpose of the binet test?"},{"output":"10 months","context":"","input":"How long was the israeli war of independence?"},{"output":"5.7G28mm","context":"See Variants:\\r\\nThe FN P90, also known as the FN Project 1990, is a personal defense weapon (PDW) designed and manufactured by FN Herstal in Belgium.[9] Created in response to NATO requests for a replacement for 9G19mm Parabellum firearms, the P90 was designed as a compact but powerful firearm for vehicle crews, operators of crew-served weapons, support personnel, special forces, and counter-terrorist groups.[9][10]\\r\\nDesigned in conjunction with the FN Five-seven pistol and FN 5.7G28mm ammunition,[4] development of the weapon began in 1986, and production commenced in 1990 (from which the \\"90\\" in its name is derived[4]), whereupon the 5.7G28mm ammunition was redesigned and shortened.[1] A modified version of the P90 with a magazine adapted to use the new ammunition was introduced in 1993, and the Five-seven pistol was subsequently introduced as a companion weapon using the same 5.7G28mm ammunition.[11]\\r\\nFeaturing a compact bullpup design with an integrated reflex sight and fully ambidextrous controls, the P90 is an unconventional weapon with a futuristic appearance.[12] Its design incorporates several innovations such as a unique top-mounted magazine and FN's small-caliber, high-velocity 5.7G28mm ammunition.[12]\\r\\nThe P90 is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations, such as Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Greece, India, Malaysia, Poland, and the United States.[13] In the United States, the P90 is in use with over 200 law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service.[14] While developed and initially marketed as a PDW, it can also be considered a submachine gun or compact assault rifle.[12] The standard selective fire P90 is restricted to military and law enforcement customers, but since 2005, a semi-automatic version has been offered to civilian shooters as the PS90.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe P90 and its 5.7G28mm ammunition were developed by FN Herstal in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9G19mm Parabellum cartridge and associated pistols and submachine guns.[16] NATO called for two types of weapons chambered for a new cartridgeone a shoulder-fired weapon, and the other a handheld weapon.[16] According to NATO, these new weapons, termed personal defense weapons (PDWs), were to provide \\"personal protection in last-resort situations when the user is directly endangered by the enemy [...].\\"[16] In 1989, NATO published document D/296, outlining a number of preliminary specifications for these weapons:\\r\\nFN Herstal was the first small arms manufacturer to respond to NATO's requirement; FN started by developing a shoulder-fired personal defense weapon, the P90, along with a small caliber, high velocity 5.7G28mm cartridge type.[16] The original 5.7G28mm cartridge, called the SS90, went into production with the P90 in 1990.[17] The SS90 propelled a 1.5?g (23?grain) plastic-core projectile from the P90 at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850?m/s (2,800?ft/s).[17] Shortly after its introduction, the P90 was adopted and used in service with the Belgian special forces group in the 1991 Gulf War.[1]\\r\\nFollowing the P90's introduction, FN revised the 5.7G28mm ammunition.[11] The new variation, designated the SS190, used a projectile 2.7?mm (0.11?in) shorter in length than that of the SS90.[17] This allowed it to be used more conveniently in the 5.7G28mm FN Five-seven pistol, which was under development at that time.[11] The SS190 projectile had a greater weight, and a more conventional construction with an aluminium and steel core.[11][17] The first prototypes of the SS190 were created in 1992, and the design was finalized in 1993, replacing the SS90.[11] A modified version of the P90, with a magazine adapted to use the shortened ammunition, was then introduced in the same year.[11] Several special cartridge variations were developed, such as the L191 tracer round and the SB193 subsonic round for use with a sound-suppressed P90.[7]\\r\\nIn 2002 and 2003, NATO conducted a series of tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9G19mm Parabellum cartridge.[10] The tests compared the relative merits of the FN 5.7G28mm cartridge and the HK 4.6G30mm cartridge, which was created by German small arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7G28mm.[10] The results of the NATO tests were analyzed by a group formed of experts from Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the group's conclusion was that the 5.7G28mm was \\"undoubtedly\\" the more efficient cartridge.[10] However, the German delegation and others rejected the NATO recommendation that 5.7G28mm be standardized, halting the standardization process indefinitely.[10][16] As a result, both the 4.6G30mm and 5.7G28mm cartridges (and the associated weapons) have been independently adopted by various NATO countries, according to preference; the P90 is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 countries throughout the world.[13][16]\\r\\nFurther development of the P90 led to the creation of the P90 TR model, which has a MIL-STD-1913 triple rail interface for mounting accessories.[16] This model was introduced in late 1999 and continues to be offered alongside the standard P90.[16] More recently, the P90 has been offered to civilian shooters as the PS90, a semi-automatic carbine intended for personal protection and sporting use.[18]\\r\\nThe P90 is a selective fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic rate of fire of 900 RPM (rounds per minute).[7][8] The weapon is chambered for FN's 5.7G28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape is based on extensive ergonomic research.[7][9] The weapon is grasped by means of a thumbhole in the frame that acts as a pistol grip, as well as an oversized trigger guard that acts as a foregrip for the shooter's support hand.[17] The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost.[15] Overall, the weapon is relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5?kg (5.6?lb) empty, or 3?kg (6.6?lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.[9][17]\\r\\nThe P90 is notable for being fully ambidextrousit can be operated by right or left-handed shooters with equal ease, and without making any modifications to the weapon.[17] FN Herstal has described it as the \\"first fully ambidextrous individual automatic weapon.\\"[19] The charging handle, magazine release and backup iron sights are symmetrically distributed on both sides of the weapon, and the firing selector is located directly at the foot of the trigger, where it can be operated from either side by the shooter's trigger finger or support hand thumb.[8] When fired, the P90 ejects spent cartridge casings downward through a chute located behind the grip, so spent cases are kept out of the shooter's line of sight.[17]\\r\\nThe P90 can be fitted with a sling for greater ease of carry, and since the weapon has a fixed stock (as opposed to having a collapsing or folding stock), it can be quickly deployed when needed.[17][20] The weapon's smooth, rounded contours prevent it from snagging on the shooter's clothing or equipment, and a small vertical protrusion is provided at the front end of the weapon's frame to prevent the shooter's hand from accidentally slipping in front of the muzzle while shooting.[9][17] A hollow compartment inside the rear of the weapon's frameaccessed by removing the buttplateallows for convenient storage of a cleaning kit.[17]\\r\\nThe P90 was designed to have a length no greater than a man's shoulder width, to allow it to be easily carried and maneuvered in tight spaces, such as the inside of an armored vehicle.[12] To achieve this, the weapon's design uses the unconventional bullpup configuration, in which the action and magazine are located behind the trigger and alongside the shooter's face so that there is no wasted space in the stock.[15] The P90's dimensions are minimized by its unique horizontally mounted feeding system, wherein the box magazine sits parallel to the barrel on top of the weapon's frame.[12] The weapon overall has an extremely compact profileit is the most compact fixed-stock submachine gun to be made.[12] The standard version of the weapon has an overall length of 500?mm (19.7?in), a height of 210?mm (8.3?in), and a width of 55?mm (2.2?in).[7]\\r\\nThe P90 requires minimal maintenance, and it can be disassembled quickly and easily.[7][21] It is a modular firearm, consisting of four main component groups: the barrel and optical sight group, the moving parts group, the frame and trigger group, and the hammer group. The P90's barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with an overall length of 263?mm (10.4?in).[8] The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231?mm (1:9.1?in), and it is equipped with a diagonally cut flash suppressor that also acts as a recoil compensator.[7][8] The stated service life of the barrel is 20,000 rounds.[12]\\r\\nThe P90 uses an internal hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, located at the foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S?ÿ safe, 1?ÿ semi-automatic fire, and A?ÿ fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault riflepulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.[17]\\r\\nParticularly significant to the design of the P90 is the small-caliber, high-velocity bottlenecked cartridge it uses. The 5.7G28mm cartridge was created by FN Herstal in response to a NATO requirement that called for a replacement for the 9G19mm Parabellum cartridge, which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns.[10] The 5.7G28mm cartridge weighs 6.0?g (93?grains)roughly half as much as a typical 9G19mm cartridgeallowing the same number of rounds to be carried for less weight, or allowing more rounds to be carried for the same weight.[15][22][23] Since the 5.7G28mm cartridge has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine.[24] The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it produces roughly 30?percent less recoil than the 9G19mm cartridge, improving controllability.[23] Due to its high velocity, the 5.7G28mm exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory, compared to typical pistol ammunition.[12][21]\\r\\nOne of the design intents for the standard 5.7G28mm cartridge type, the SS190, was that it have the ability to penetrate Kevlar protective vests that stop conventional pistol bullets.[23] Fired from the P90, the 5.7G28mm SS190 has a muzzle velocity of roughly 716?m/s (2,350?ft/s, Mach 2) and can penetrate the NATO CRISAT vest or a Level IIIA Kevlar vest at a range of 200 m (219 yd).[21][23] FN states an effective range of 200?m (219?yd) and a maximum range of 1,800?m (1,969?yd) for the 5.7G28mm cartridge when fired from the P90.[7]\\r\\nIn testing conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1999, the SS190 fired from the P90 at a distance of 25?m (27?yd) exhibited an average penetration depth of 25?cm (9.85?in) in ballistic gelatin covered with a Level II vest.[25] The SS190 exhibited penetration depths ranging from 28 to 34?cm (11 to 13.5?in) when fired from the P90 into bare ballistic gelatin, in tests conducted by Houston Police Department SWAT.[21] In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7G28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point (\\"tumble\\") as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85?in) projectile length[26] to create a larger wound cavity.[9][15][21][27] However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, and it is a subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.[27]\\r\\nThe 5.7G28mm projectile potentially poses less risk of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, as well as risk of ricochet.[25][28] The lightweight projectile loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437?yd), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9G19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875?yd), posing greater risk of collateral damage in the event of a miss.[12] This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7G28mm cartridge's intended applications, so the cartridge's limited energy at long range is not considered to be disadvantageous.[12] Since the SS190 projectile does not rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow point, the cartridge (and 5.7G28mm weapons) is considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare.[27]\\r\\nThe P90 uses a unique horizontally mounted feeding systempatented in the United Statesthat contributes to the weapon's compact profile and unusual appearance.[12] U.S. Patent 4,905,394 (\\"Top mounted longitudinal magazine\\") was awarded in 1990, naming Ren Predazzer as the sole inventor.[31] The detachable box magazine is mounted parallel to the P90's barrel, fitting flush with the top of the weapon's frame, and it contains 50 rounds of ammunition which lie in two rows facing left, offset 90 from the bore axis.[17] As the cartridges are pushed back by spring pressure and arrive at the rear end of the magazine, they are fed as a single row into a spiral feed ramp and rotated 90 degrees, aligning them with the chamber.[17] The magazine body is composed of polymer, and it is semi-transparent to allow the shooter to see the amount of ammunition remaining at any time.[17]\\r\\nThe P90 was originally equipped with the Ring Sights HC-14-62 reflex sight, but the current weapon is instead fitted with the Ring Sights MC-10-80 sight, which was specifically designed for it.[16][33] The HC-14-62 has a polymer housing and uses a forward-aimed fiber optic collector to illuminate the white daytime reticle, which consists of a large circle of about 180 minutes of arc (MOA), with a 20 MOA circle surrounding a 3.5 MOA dot in the center. The MC-10-80 has an anodized aluminium housing, and has a similar black reticle. The night reticle for both the HC-14-62 and the MC-10-80 consists of an open T that is primarily illuminated by a tritium module, and, in the HC-14-62, ambient light drawn in by an upward-facing collector. The sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation, and it can be used in conjunction with night vision equipment.[33] As backup in case the reflex sight is damaged, a set of fixed iron sights is provided on each side of the reflex sight housing.[33]\\r\\nThe P90 has provisions for mounting a number of different types of accessories, including tactical lights and laser aiming devices. A sling can be attached to the P90 for greater ease of carry, or it can be fitted with various sound suppressors such as the Gemtech SP90, which was designed specifically for the weapon in cooperation with FN Herstal.[7] This stainless steel suppressor with a black oxide finish is built according to MIL-SPECs, including saltwater corrosion resistance.[7] It has a length of 184?mm (7.2?in), a diameter of 35?mm (1.4?in) and a weight of 680 g (1.5?lb).[7] When subsonic ammunition is used in conjunction with the suppressor, it reduces the sound signature of the P90 by 33?dB.[7] A small case collector pouch for the P90 is available which fits over the ejection port and collects spent cases as they are ejected downward; the pouch will collect up to one hundred cases before filling.[16][21]\\r\\nThe Laserex P90 laser systems have a weight of 131 g (0.29?lb), and they are activated by means of a green pressure switch located on the underside of the weapon's pistol grip.[35] The lasers can be configured for three different internal settings: Off?ÿ disabled to prevent accidental activation, Training?ÿ low intensity for eye safety and extended battery life in training, or Combat?ÿ high intensity for maximum visibility.[35] The Laserex P90 laser systems have a battery life of 250 hours when used on the Training setting, or a life of 50 hours when used on the Combat setting.[35]\\r\\nThe PS90 is a carbine version of the P90, intended for civilian shooters for personal protection and sporting use; it was introduced in 2005, and continues to be offered in several configurations.[18][36] The PS90 will accept the standard 50-round P90 magazines, but the gun is supplied with a magazine that is blocked to a capacity of 10 or 30 rounds, allowing it to be sold in jurisdictions where magazine capacities are restricted by law.[36]\\r\\nIn order to be legal for purchase by civilians without obtaining a tax stamp for a Short Barreled Rifle (SBR) as defined by the United States National Firearms Act, the PS90 carbine has an extended 407?mm (16?in) barrel and is semi-automatic, with a trigger pull of approximately 31ÿ36 newtons (7.0ÿ8.1?lbf).[32][36] The lengthened barrel has eight rifling grooves, with a right-hand twist rate of 1:229?mm (1:9 in) and a rifled length of 376?mm (14.8?in); the muzzle is equipped with a fixed \\"birdcage\\" type flash suppressor.[36]\\r\\nDespite the added barrel length, the PS90 is relatively compact and lightweight, with an overall length of 667?mm (26.3?in), and a weight of 3.4?kg (7.5?lb) with a fully loaded 50-round magazine.[36] Due to the added barrel length, the PS90 can achieve a muzzle velocity of up to 777?m/s (2,550?ft/s) with SS195LF ammunition, or up to 930?m/s (3,050?ft/s) with third-party ammunition.[29][30]\\r\\nDespite being originally intended as a defensive weapon for military personnel whose primary role is not fighting with small arms (such as vehicle drivers), most sales of the P90 have been to special forces and counter-terrorist groups who use it for offensive roles.[16] The P90 first saw operational use in the 1991 Gulf War, where it was used by the Belgian special forces group.[1]\\r\\nIn 1997, suppressed P90s were used in combat by the Peruvian special forces group (Grupo de Fuerzas Especiales) in Operation Chavn de Huantar, the hostage rescue siege that ended the Japanese embassy hostage crisis.[37] The operation was a success: all 14 MRTA revolutionaries were killed, and 71 hostages were rescued.[37] The MRTA revolutionaries who had taken the hostages were equipped with body armor, but it was defeated by the Peruvian special forces' P90s.[38] In 2011, P90s were used by Muammar Gaddafi's military forces in the 2011 Libyan civil war, and some of these examples were captured and used in the war by Libyan rebel forces.[3]\\r\\nBy 2009, the P90 was in service with military and police forces in over 40 countries.[13] In the United States, Houston Police Department was the first local law enforcement agency to adopt the P90, acquiring it for their SWAT team in 1999.[21] In 2003, the Houston SWAT team became one of the first agencies in the country to use the weapon in a shootout.[21] By 2009, the P90 was in use with over 200 law enforcement agencies in the United States,[14] including the Secret Service and Federal Protective Service.[7][39] In response, the National Rifle Association added the P90 and PS90 to its NRA Tactical Police Competition standards, allowing law enforcement agencies to compete in the event using either weapon.[40]\\r\\nMilitary and law enforcement organizations using the P90 include:","input":"What kind of ammo does a p90 use?"},{"output":"Yogi Adityanath","context":"The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP), a North Indian state, is the head of the Government of Uttar Pradesh.

It often involves striking the student either across the buttocks[1] or on the hands,[2] with an implement such as a rattan cane, wooden paddle, slipper, leather strap or wooden yardstick. Less commonly, it could also include spanking or smacking the student with the open hand, especially at the elementary school level.\\r\\nIn the English-speaking world, the use by schools of corporal punishment has historically been justified by the common-law doctrine in loco parentis, whereby teachers are considered authority figures granted the same rights as parents to punish children in their care.\\r\\nAdvocates of school corporal punishment argue that it provides an immediate response to indiscipline and that the student is quickly back in the classroom learning, as opposed to suspension from school. Opponents, including a number of medical and psychological societies, along with human-rights groups, argue that physical punishment is ineffective in the long term, interferes with learning, leads to antisocial behaviour as well as various forms of mental distress, and is a form of violence that breaches the rights of children.\\r\\nPoland in 1783 was the first nation to outlaw corporal punishment in schools. School corporal punishment is no longer practised in any European country. As of 2015, most developed countries have abolished the practice, with the exception of some parts of the United States, some Australian states, and Singapore. It is still in common use in a number of countries in Africa and Asia. It was banned in state-funded schools, throughout the United Kingdom, in 1986. It was banned in UK Public and private schools that received no state funding, in 1999 in England and Wales, 2000 in Scotland, and 2003 in Northern Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporal punishment in the context of schools in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has been variously defined as: causing deliberate pain to a child in response to the child's undesired behaviour and/or language,[3] \\"purposeful infliction of bodily pain or discomfort by an official in the educational system upon a student as a penalty for unacceptable behavior\\",[4] and \\"intentional application of physical pain as a means of changing behavior\\" (not the occasional use of physical restraint to protect student or others from immediate harm).[5]\\r\\nCorporal punishment used to be prevalent in schools in many parts of the world, but in recent decades it has been outlawed in most of Europe, most of South America, as well as in Canada, Korea, South Africa, New Zealand and several other countries. It remains commonplace in a number of countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East (see list of countries, below).\\r\\nWhile most U.S. states have outlawed corporal punishment in state schools, it continues to be allowed mainly in the Southern and Western United States.[6] According to the United States Department of Education, more than 216,000 students were subjected to corporal punishment during the 2008ÿ09 school year.[7]\\r\\nMuch of the traditional culture that surrounds corporal punishment in school, at any rate in the English-speaking world, derives largely from British practice in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly as regards the caning of teenage boys.[8] There is a vast amount of literature on this, in both popular and serious culture.[9][10] Britain itself outlawed the practice in 1987 for state schools[11][12][13] and more recently for all schools.[14][15]\\r\\nThe doctrine of in loco parentis lets school officials stand in for parents as comparable authority figures.[4] The doctrine has its origins in an English common-law precedent of 1770.[5]\\r\\nMany schools in Singapore and Malaysia use caning (for boys) as a routine official punishment for misconduct, as also some African countries. In some Middle Eastern countries whipping is used. (See list of countries, below.)\\r\\nIn most of continental Europe, school corporal punishment has been banned for several decades or longer, depending on the country (see the list of countries below).\\r\\nFrom the 1917 Russian revolution onwards, corporal punishment was outlawed in the Soviet Union, because it was deemed contrary to communist ideology.[16] Communists in other countries such as Britain took the lead in campaigning against school corporal punishment, which they viewed as a symptom of the decadence of capitalist education systems.[17] In the 1960s, Soviet visitors to western schools expressed shock at the caning of boys there.[18] Other communist regimes followed suit: for instance, corporal punishment was \\"unknown\\" by students in North Korea in 2007.[19] In mainland China, corporal punishment in schools was outlawed in 1986,[20] although the practice remains common, especially in rural areas.[21]\\r\\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, there are three broad rationales for the use of corporal punishment in schools: beliefs, based in traditional religion, that adults have a right, if not a duty, to physically punish misbehaving children; a disciplinary philosophy that corporal punishment builds character, being necessary for the development of a child's conscience and their respect for adult authority figures; and beliefs concerning the needs and rights of teachers, specifically that corporal punishment is essential for maintaining order and control in the classroom.[4]\\r\\nSchool officials and policymakers often rely on personal anecdotes to argue that school corporal punishment improves students' behavior and achievement.[22] However, there is a lack of empirical evidence showing that corporal punishment leads to better control in the classroom. In particular, evidence does not suggest that it enhances moral character development, increases students' respect for teachers or other authority figures, or offers greater security for teachers.[23]\\r\\nA number of medical, pediatric or psychological societies have issued statements opposing all corporal punishment in schools, citing such outcomes as poorer academic achievement, increases in antisocial behaviour, injuries to students, and an unwelcoming learning environment. They include the American Medical Association,[24] the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,[3] the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP),[4][25][26] the Society for Adolescent Medicine,[5][27] the American Psychological Association,[28] the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health,[29][30] the Royal College of Psychiatrists,[31] the Canadian Paediatric Society[32] and the Australian Psychological Society,[33] as well as the United States' National Association of Secondary School Principals.[34]\\r\\nAccording to the AAP, research shows that corporal punishment is less effective than other methods of behaviour management in schools, and \\"praise, discussions regarding values, and positive role models do more to develop character, respect, and values than does corporal punishment\\".[4] They say that evidence links corporal punishment of students to a number of adverse outcomes, including: \\"increased aggressive and destructive behaviour, increased disruptive classroom behaviour, vandalism, poor school achievement, poor attention span, increased drop-out rate, school avoidance and school phobia, low self-esteem, anxiety, somatic complaints, depression, suicide and retaliation against teachers\\".[4] The AAP recommends a number of alternatives to corporal punishment including various nonviolent behaviour-management strategies, modifications to the school environment, and increased support for teachers.[4]\\r\\nAn estimated 1 to 2 percent of physically punished students in the United States are seriously injured, to the point of needing medical attention. According to the AAP and the Society for Adolescent Medicine, these injuries have included bruises, abrasions, broken bones, whiplash injury, muscle damage, brain injury, and even death.[4][5] Other reported injuries to students include \\"sciatic nerve damage\\"[4] \\"extensive hematomas\\", and \\"life-threatening fat hemorrhage\\".[5]\\r\\nThe AAP cautions that there is a risk of corporal punishment in schools fostering the impression among students that violence is an appropriate means for managing others' behaviour.[4] According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \\"Corporal punishment signals to the child that a way to settle interpersonal conflicts is to use physical force and inflict pain\\".[3] And according to the Society for Adolescent Medicine, \\"The use of corporal punishment in schools promotes a very precarious message: that violence is an acceptable phenomenon in our society. It sanctions the notion that it is meritorious to be violent toward our children, thereby devaluing them in society's eyes. It encourages children to resort to violence because they see their authority figures or substitute parents doing it [...] Violence is not acceptable and we must not support it by sanctioning its use by such authority figures as school officials\\".[5]\\r\\nThe Society for Adolescent Medicine recommends developing \\"a milieu of effective communication, in which the teacher displays an attitude of respect for the students\\", as well as instruction that is stimulating and appropriate to student's abilities, various nonviolent behaviour modification techniques, and involving students and parents in making decisions about school matters such as rules and educational goals. They suggest that student self-governance can be an effective alternative for managing disruptive classroom behaviour, while stressing the importance of adequate training and support for teachers.[5]\\r\\nThe AAP remarks that there has been \\"no reported increase in disciplinary problems in schools following the elimination of corporal punishment\\" according to evidence.[4]\\r\\nA number of international human-rights organizations including the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have stated that physical punishment of any kind is a violation of children's human rights.[35][36][37]\\r\\nAccording to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, \\"Children do not lose their human rights by virtue of passing through the school gates [...] the use of corporal punishment does not respect the inherent dignity of the child nor the strict limits on school discipline\\".[38] The Committee interprets Article 19 of the Convention on the rights of the child, which obliges member states to \\"take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse [] while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child\\", to imply a prohibition on all forms of corporal punishment.\\r\\nOther international human-rights bodies supporting prohibition of corporal punishment of children in all settings, including schools, include the European Committee of Social Rights and the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. In addition, the obligation of member states to prohibit corporal punishment in schools and elsewhere was affirmed in the 2009 Cairo Declaration on the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Islamic Jurisprudence.[39]\\r\\nCorporal punishment of minors in the United States\\r\\nAccording to the Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children, all forms of corporal punishment in schools are outlawed in 125 countries as of May 2015 (46 of these countries also prohibit corporal punishment of children in the home).[39]\\r\\nBanned in 1813, corporal punishment was re-legalised in 1817 and punishments by physical pain lasted until the 1980s. The instruments were rebenques, slappings in the face and others.[40][41] All corporal punishment has now been prohibited; the ban came into effect in 2016.[42]\\r\\nIn Australia, laws on corporal punishment in schools are determined at individual state or territory level.[43][44] While still legal in private schools in some states, in practice, very few schools impose corporal punishment.[45]\\r\\nCorporal punishment in schools was banned in Austria in 1974.[67]\\r\\nCorporal punishment in all settings, including schools, was prohibited in Bolivia in 2014. According to the Children and Adolescents Code, \\"The child and adolescent has the right to good treatment, comprising a non-violent upbringing and education... Any physical, violent and humiliating punishment is prohibited\\".[68]\\r\\nCorporal punishment in all settings, including schools, was prohibited in Brazil in 2014. According to an amendment to the Code on Children and Adolescents 1990, \\"Children and Adolescents are entitled to be educated and cared for without the use of physical punishment or cruel or degrading treatment as forms of correction, discipline, education or any other pretext\\".[69]\\r\\nCaning is commonly used by teachers as a punishment in schools.[70] The cane is applied on the students' buttocks, calves or palms of the hands in front of the class. Tramline cane marks could be left. Sit-ups with ears pulled and arms crossed, kneeling, and standing on the bench in the classroom are other forms of corporal punishments used in schools. Common reasons for punishment include talking in class, not finishing homework, mistakes made with classwork, fighting and truancy.[71][72]\\r\\nIn Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (2004) the Supreme Court outlawed school corporal punishment.[73] In public schools, the usual implement was a rubber/canvas strap applied to the hands,[74] while private schools often used a paddle or cane administered to the student's posterior.[75][76] In many parts of Canada, 'the strap' had not been used in public schools since the 1970s or even earlier: thus, it has been claimed that it had not been used in Quebec since the 1960s,[77] and in Toronto it was banned in 1971.[2] However, some schools in Alberta had been using the strap up until the ban in 2004.[78]\\r\\nIn 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada outlawed corporal punishment in all schools, public or private. The practice itself had largely been abandoned in the 1970s when parents placed greater scrutiny on the treatment of children at school.[79] The subject received extensive media coverage, and corporal punishment became obsolete as the practice was widely seen as degrading and inhumane. Despite the fact that the tradition had been forgone for nearly 30 years, legislation banning the practice entirely by law was not implemented until 2004.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Canadian provinces banned corporal punishment in public schools prior to the national ban in 2004. They are, in chronological order by year of provincial ban:[citation needed]\\r\\nCorporal punishment in China was officially banned after the communist revolution in 1949. The Compulsory Education Law of 1986 states: \\"It shall be forbidden to inflict physical punishment on students\\".[20] In practice, beatings by schoolteachers are common, especially in rural areas.[21][81]\\r\\nAll corporal punishment, both in school and in the home, has been banned since 2008.[82]\\r\\nCorporal punishment is outlawed under Article 31 of the Education Act.[83]\\r\\nCorporal punishment was prohibited in the public schools in Copenhagen Municipality in 1951 and by law in all schools of Denmark in 1967.[84][85][86]\\r\\nA 1998 study found that random physical punishment (not proper formal corporal punishment) was being used extensively by teachers in Egypt to punish behavior they regarded as unacceptable. Around 80% of the boys and 60% of the girls were punished by teachers, using their hands, sticks, straps, shoes, punches and kicks as most common methods of administration. The most common reported injuries were bumps and contusions.[87]\\r\\nCorporal punishment in public schools was banned in 1914, but remained de facto commonplace until 1984, when a law banning all corporal punishment of minors, even by parents, was introduced.[88][89]\\r\\nThe systematic use of corporal punishment has been absent from French schools since the 19th century.[90] There is no explicit legal ban on it,[91] but in 2008 a teacher was fined ?500 for what some people describe as slapping a student.[92][93][94]\\r\\nSchool corporal punishment, historically widespread, was outlawed in different states via their administrative law at different times. It was not completely abolished everywhere until 1983.[95] Since 1993, use of corporal punishment by a teacher has been a criminal offence. In that year a sentence by the Federal Court of Justice of Germany (Bundesgerichtshof, case number NStZ 1993,591) was published which overruled the previous powers enshrined in unofficial customary law (Gewohnheitsrecht) and upheld by some regional appeal courts (Oberlandesgericht, Superior State Court) even in the 1970s. They assumed a right of chastisement was a defense of justification against the accusation of \\"causing bodily harm\\" per Paragraph (=Section) 223 Strafgesetzbuch (Federal Penal Code).\\r\\nCorporal punishment in Greek primary schools was banned in 1998, and in secondary schools in 2005.[96]\\r\\nCorporal punishment is still used in most of India. The Delhi High Court banned its use in Delhi schools in 2000. 17 out of 29 states claim to apply the ban, though enforcement is lax.[97] A number of social and cultural groups, including Shankaracharya, are campaigning against corporal punishment in India. In many states, corporal punishment is still practised within most schools. Society for Prevention of Injuries & Corporal Punishment (SPIC) is actively running awareness campaigns to educate the teachers and students through conferences and scientific publications.[98]\\r\\nIn schools in Ireland, corporal punishment was banned by regulation in 1982, and its use became a criminal offence in 1996. [99]\\r\\nCorporal punishment in Italian schools was banned in 1928.[100]\\r\\nAlthough banned in 1947, corporal punishment is still commonly found in schools in the 2010s and particularly widespread in school sports clubs. In late 1987, about 60% of junior high school teachers felt it was necessary, with 7% believing it was necessary in all conditions, 59% believing it should be applied sometimes and 32% disapproving of it in all circumstances; while at elementary (primary) schools, 2% supported it unconditionally, 47% felt it was necessary and 49% disapproved.[101] As recent as December 2012, a high school student committed suicide after having been constantly beaten by his basketball coach.[102] An education ministry survey found that more than 10,000 students received illegal corporal punishment from more than 5,000 teachers across Japan in 2012 fiscal year alone.[103]\\r\\nCorporal punishment in schools was banned in 1845 and became a criminal offence in 1974 (Aggravated Assault on Minors under Authority). [104][105]\\r\\nCaning is a common form of discipline in many Malaysian schools. Legally it should be applied only to male students, but the idea of making the caning of girls lawful has recently been debated. This would be applied to the palm of the hand, whereas boys are typically caned across the seat of the trousers.[106]\\r\\nBanned in 1920.[107]\\r\\nCorporal punishment in New Zealand schools was abolished in 1987, but wasn't abolished legislatively until 23 July 1990, when Section 139A of the Education Act 1989 was inserted by the Education Amendment Act 1990. Section 139A prohibits anyone employed by a school or ECE provider, or anyone supervising or controlling students on the school's behalf, from using force by way of correction or punishment towards any student at or in relation to the school or the student under their supervision or control.[108] Teachers who administer corporal punishment can be found guilty of physical assault, resulting in termination and cancellation of teacher registration, and possibly criminal charges, with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.[109]\\r\\nAs enacted, the law had a loophole: parents, provided they were not school staff, could still discipline their children on school grounds. In early 2007, a southern Auckland Christian school was found to be using this loophole to discipline students by corporal punishment, by making the student's parents administer the punishment.[110] This loophole was closed in May 2007 by the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007, which enacted a blanket ban on parents administering corporal punishment to their children.\\r\\nCorporal punishment in Norwegian schools was strongly restricted in 1889, and was prohibited outright in 1936.[citation needed]\\r\\nSchool corporal punishment in Pakistan is not very common in modern educational institutions although it is still used in schools across the rural parts of the country as a means of enforcing student discipline. The method has been criticised by some children's rights activists who claim that many cases of corporal punishment in schools have resulted in physical and mental abuse of schoolchildren. According to one report, corporal punishment is a key reason for school dropouts and subsequently, street children, in Pakistan; as many as 35,000 high school pupils in Pakistan are said to drop out of the education system each year because they have been punished or abused in school.[111]\\r\\nCorporal punishment is prohibited in private and public schools.[112]\\r\\nIn 1783, Poland became the first country in the world to prohibit corporal punishment.[113] Peter Newell assumes that perhaps the most influential writer on the subject was the English philosopher John Locke, whose Some Thoughts Concerning Education explicitly criticised the central role of corporal punishment in education. Locke's work was highly influential, and may have helped influence Polish legislators to ban corporal punishment from Poland's schools in 1783. Today, the ban of corporal punishment in all forms is vested in Constitution of Poland[114][115]\\r\\nCorporal punishment was banned in USSR (and hence, Russian) schools in 1917.[16] In addition,the Article 336 (since 2006) of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation states that any teacher who has used corporal punishment on a pupil shall be dismissed.\\r\\nCorporal punishment is legal in Singapore schools (for male students only, it is illegal to inflict it on female students) and fully encouraged by the government in order to maintain strict discipline.[116] Only a light rattan cane may be used.[117] This must be administered in a formal ceremony by the school management after due deliberation, not by classroom teachers. Most secondary schools (whether independent, autonomous or government-controlled), and also some primary schools, use caning to deal with misconduct by boys.[118] At the secondary level, the rattan strokes are nearly always delivered to the student's clothed buttocks. The Ministry of Education has stipulated a maximum of six strokes per occasion. In some cases the punishment is carried out in front of the rest of the school instead of in private.[119]\\r\\nThe use of corporal punishment in schools was prohibited by the South African Schools Act, 1996. According to section 10 of the act:\\r\\n(1) No person may administer corporal punishment at a school to a learner.\\r\\n(2) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a sentence which could be imposed for assault.[120]\\r\\nIn the case of Christian Education South Africa v Minister of Education the Constitutional Court rejected a claim that the constitutional right to religious freedom entitles private Christian schools to impose corporal punishment.\\r\\nLiberal regions in South Korea have completely banned all forms of caning beginning with Gyeonggi Province in 2010, followed by Seoul Metropolitan City, Gangwon Province, Gwangju Metropolitan City and North Jeolla Province in 2011.[121] Other more conservative regions are governed by a national law enacted in 2011 which states that while caning is generally forbidden, it can be used indirectly to maintain school discipline.[122] but it is still known to be practised[123]\\r\\nCorporal punishment in Spanish schools was banned in 1985.[124]\\r\\nCorporal punishment at school has been prohibited in folkskolestadgan (the elementary school ordinance) since 1 January 1958. Its use by ordinary teachers in grammar schools had been outlawed in 1928.[125]\\r\\nIn 2006 Taiwan made corporal punishment in the school system illegal,[126] but it is still known to be practised (see Corporal punishment in Taiwan).\\r\\nCorporal punishment in schools is illegal under the Ministry of Education Regulation on Student Punishment (2005) and the National Committee on Child Protection Regulation on Working Procedures of Child Protection Officers Involved in Promoting Behaviour of Students (2005), pursuant to article 65 of the Child Protection Act.[127]\\r\\nCorporal punishment was banned in USSR (and hence, Ukrainian) schools in 1917.[16] In Ukraine, \\"physical or mental violence\\" against children is forbidden by the Constitution (Art.52.2) and the Law on Education (Art.51.1, since 1991) which states that students and other learners have the right to the protection from any form of exploitation, physical and psychological violence, actions of pedagogical and other employees who violate the rights or humiliate their honour and dignity.[128] Standard instructions for teachers provided by the Ministry of Science and Education state that a teacher who has used corporal punishment to a pupil (even once), shall be dismissed.\\r\\nA federal law was implemented in 1998 which banned school corporal punishment. The law applied to all schools, both public and private.[129][130] Any teacher who engages in the practice would not only lose their job and teaching license, but will also face criminal prosecution for engaging in violence against minors and will also face child abuse charges.[131]\\r\\nIn state-run schools, and in private schools where at least part of the funding came from government, corporal punishment was outlawed by the British Parliament in 1986.[132] In other private schools, it was banned in 1998 (England and Wales), 2000 (Scotland) and 2003 (Northern Ireland).[133] Schools had to keep a record of punishments inflicted,[134] and there are occasional press reports of examples of these \\"punishment books\\" having survived.[135][136]\\r\\nThe implement used in many state and private schools in England and Wales was often a rattan cane, struck either across the student's hands or (especially in the case of teenage boys) the clothed buttocks. \\"Slippering\\"striking the buttocks with a rubber-soled gym shoe, or plimsoll shoewas widely used in many schools, for example King's School, Macclesfield, a boys grammar school in Cheshire.[137] In a few English cities, a strap was used instead of the cane.[138] In Scotland a leather strap, the tawse, administered to the palms of the hands, was universal in state schools,[139] but some private schools used the cane.[140]\\r\\nPrior to the ban in private schools in England, the \\"slippering\\" of a student at an independent boarding school was challenged in 1993 before the European Court of Human Rights.[141] The Court ruled 5ÿ4 in that case that the punishment was not severe enough to infringe the student's \\"freedom from degrading punishment\\" under article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The dissenting judges argued that the ritualised nature of the punishment, given after several days and without parental consent, should qualify it as \\"degrading punishment\\".[142]\\r\\nR (Williamson) v Secretary of State for Education and Employment (2005) was an unsuccessful challenge to the prohibition of corporal punishment contained in the Education Act 1996, by several headmasters of private Christian schools who argued that it was a breach of their religious freedom.\\r\\nIn response to a 2008 poll of 6,162 UK teachers by the Times Educational Supplement, 22% of secondary school teachers and 16% of primary school teachers supported \\"the right to use corporal punishment in extreme cases\\". The National Union of Teachers said that it \\"could not support the views expressed by those in favour of hitting children\\".[143][144]\\r\\nThere is no federal law addressing corporal punishment in public or private schools. In 1977, the Supreme Court ruling in Ingraham v. Wright held that the Eighth Amendment clause prohibiting \\"cruel and unusual punishments\\" did not apply to school students, and that teachers could punish children without parental permission.\\r\\nAs of 2015, 31 states and the District of Columbia have banned corporal punishment in public schools, though in some of these there is no explicit prohibition. Corporal punishment is also unlawful in private schools in Iowa and New Jersey. In 19 U.S. states, corporal punishment is lawful in both public and private schools.[145] It is still common in some schools in the South, and more than 167,000 students were paddled in the 2011-2012 school year in American public schools.[146] Students can be physically punished from kindergarten to the end of high school, meaning that even legal adults who have reached the age of majority are sometimes spanked by school officials.[147]\\r\\nCorporal punishment in all settings, including schools, was prohibited in Venezuela in 2007. According to the Law for the Protection of Children and Adolescents, \\"All children and young people have a right to be treated well. This right includes a non-violent education and upbringing... Consequently, all forms of physical and humiliating punishment are prohibited\\".[148]","input":"When was corporal punishment banned in the uk?"},{"output":"June 10, 2007","context":"","input":"When did the sopranos go off the air?"},{"output":"August 1922","context":"The California grizzly (Ursus arctos californicus) is an extinct subspecies of the grizzly, the very large North American brown bear. \\"Grizzly\\" could have meant \\"grizzled\\" (that is, with golden and grey tips of the hair) or \\"fear-inspiring\\".[1] Nonetheless, after careful study, naturalist George Ord formally classified it in 1815 ÿ not for its hair, but for its character ÿ as Ursus horribilis (\\"terrifying bear\\").[2] Genetically, North American grizzlies are closely related;[3] in size and coloring, the California grizzly was much like the grizzly of the southern coast of Alaska. In California, it was particularly admired for its beauty, size, and strength. The grizzly became a symbol of the Bear Flag Republic, a moniker that was attached to the short-lived attempt by a group of American settlers to break away from Mexico in 1846. Later, this rebel flag became the basis for the state flag of California, and then California was known as the \\"Bear State.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1953 researcher stated, \\"The specific status of North American brown bears (or grizzly bears) is one of the most complex problems of mammalian taxonomy. The difficulty stems directly from the work of Merriam (1918), who concluded that there are 86 forms of grizzlies (and brown bears) in North America.\\"[5]\\r\\nNorth American grizzlies were taxonomically grouped as a species apart from other bear species, until DNA testing revealed that they should properly be grouped in the same species as the other brown bears.[3] Grizzlies living in California had been classified by Merriam into many subspecies, but the only genetically anomalous grouping in North America is the ABC Islands bears.[6]\\r\\nThe California grizzly is one of the state's most visible and enduring symbols, adorning both the state flag and seal. The Bear Flag first flew in 1846 as a symbol of the short-lived California Republic. A second version was adopted as the state flag by the state legislature in 1911.[7] The bear symbol became a permanent part of the state seal in 1849. The California Grizzly was designated the official state animal in 1953.[8][9] The bear is celebrated in name and as mascot of the sports teams of the University of California, Berkeley (the California Golden Bears), and of the University of California, Los Angeles (the UCLA Bruins) and in the mascot of University of California, Riverside (Scottie the Bear, dressed in a Highland kilt). The California Maritime Academy operates a training ship named \\"Golden Bear\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first recorded encounters of California grizzlies by the Europeans are in the diaries kept by several members of the 1769 Portola expedition, first exploration by land of what is now the state of California. Several place names that include the Spanish word for bear (oso) trace their origins back to that first expedition (e.g. Los Osos).\\r\\nAs the settled frontier of New Spain was extended northward, settlers began to populate California and establish large cattle herds as the main industry. The grizzly bears killed livestock and so became enemies of the rancheros. Vaqueros hunted the grizzlies, sometimes roping and capturing them to be displayed in public battles with bulls.[10] This popular spectator sport inspired betting as to whether the bear or the bull would win.\\r\\nOne popular, though false[11] account is that Horace Greeley, after seeing such a fight, gave the modern stock market its \\"bear\\" and \\"bull\\" nicknames  based on the fighting styles of the two animals: the bear swipes downward while the bull hooks upward.\\r\\nIn 1866, a grizzly described as weighing as much as 2,200 pounds (1,000?kg) was killed in Valley Center, California, the biggest bear ever found in California, as recalled in 1932 by Catherine E. Lovett Smith, who had been six years old at the time and on whose family's ranch the bear had been found; Lovett Smith stated that this was where Valley Center got its original name of \\"Bear Valley\\" (other sources concurred as to the story of the bear, but differed on its size).[12]\\r\\nLess than 75 years after the discovery of gold in 1848, almost every grizzly bear in California had been tracked down and killed. One prospector in Southern California, William F. Holcomb (nicknamed \\"Grizzly Bill\\" Holcomb), was particularly well known for hunting grizzly bears in what is now San Bernardino County. The last hunted California grizzly was shot in Tulare County, California, in August 1922, although no body, skeleton or pelt was ever produced. Two years later in 1924, what was thought to be a grizzly was spotted in Sequoia National Park for the last time, and thereafter, grizzlies were never seen again in California.[12][13][14]\\r\\nCalifornian grizzlies had been pitted against other animals, such as bulls.[15]\\r\\nCalifornia still has habitat for about 500 grizzlies.[16] In 2014, the US Fish and Wildlife Service received and rejected a petition to reintroduce grizzly bears to California.[17][18] In 2015 the Center for Biological Diversity launched a petition aimed at the California state legislature to reintroduce the grizzly bear to the state.[19][20][21] The California grizzly bear has been considered as a possible candidate for attempts at deextinction, through the proposed use of back-breeding, cloning and genetic engineering to recreate extinct species.[22]\\r\\n Data related to Ursus arctos californicus at Wikispecies","input":"When was the last grizzly bear killed in california?"},{"output":"Henry Daniel Mills","context":"Henry Daniel Mills is a fictional character in ABC's television series Once Upon a Time. Henry is the boy Emma Swan gave up to adoption; Regina Mills adopted him. Henry was originally portrayed as a child by Jared S. Gilmore, who won the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series ÿ Leading Young Actor in 2012. For the show's seventh and final season, Andrew J. West later took over the role of Henry as an adult and father to a eight-year-old girl named Lucy,[1] with Gilmore also making three guest appearances as Henry  during the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Mills is Emma Swan and Neal Cassidy's son, whom she gave up for adoption after giving birth following her release from a federal correctional facility in Phoenix, Arizona in 2001.[2] He is also Snow White, Prince Charming and Rumplestiltskin's grandson, and the great-grandson of the latter's father's alias Peter Pan and latter's mother's alias the Black Fairy. He is adopted by Regina Mills (the Evil Queen), after Mr. Gold (Rumplestiltskin) procures him, naming him after her late father. At first Regina had a little difficulty raising Henry but grew to love him, thus preventing Henry from being taken by the Darling Brothers, who wanted to take Henry to Neverland on orders from Peter Pan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Henry gets older, his relationship with Regina became strained, and she sends him to regular therapy sessions. When he is ten, he receives his cherished book of fairy tales from his teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard (Snow White), discovering that the residents of Storybrooke are characters from it after noticing he is the only one in town who ages. Henry finds his biological mother Emma Swan in Boston and brings her to Storybrooke. He eventually convinces her of the truth by consuming a sleeping curse intended for her by Regina,[3] nearly resulting in him dying. However, he is awoken with true love's kiss by Emma, which also breaks the curse. Emma and Mary Margaret are then dragged into a portal, leaving David (Prince Charming) to look after him. Following the death of Regina's mother Cora, and her vowing to avenge Mary Margaret, Henry seeks to remove magic from Storybrooke. When Emma and Regina stop the trigger enacted by Greg Mendell and Tamara from destroying the town, he is kidnapped by the pair and taken to Neverland, where it is revealed that Peter Pan (Henry's great-grandfather) wants possession of him as he owns \\"the heart of the truest believer\\".[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nPan eventually persuades Henry to give him his heart, telling him it will save magic. Regina reclaims the heart and resurrects Henry. However, Pan inhabits Henry's body in Storybrooke, enacting Regina's original curse once more. Mr. Gold returns Henry to his body, and Emma and Henry escape to New York City whilst the remaining residents return to the Enchanted Forest. A year later, Hook restores Emma's memories, leading her to return to Storybrooke with Henry to save their family from another curse. Henry is confused about Emma's decision to relocate, until his past memories are restored with his book. Once his memories are restored, Regina gives him true love's kiss breaking the curse. Henry then moves back to Storybrooke where he splits his time living with Regina and the Charmings. Henry later helps Regina to search for his storybook's author, Isaac. Upon discovering the writer's manipulative actions, Henry being the only one born in the Land Without Magic is left behind in Storybrooke and goes to find Isaac and enters his new storybook \\"Heroes and Viilains\\" to fix reality and after saving Emma who remembers everything they both try to help Regina get her happy ending to fix reality but fail. Then Henry takes the pen and becomes the next author and using Regina's blood to write a new ending to fix reality. With Henry being the new author and he breaks the pen deeming it too powerful for anyone to use. Henry then watches Emma sacrificing herself to save Regina and Storybrooke by becoming the new Dark One.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his family and a few of the other residents, Henry transports to the Enchanted Forest to find Emma and to take her to Camelot in order to find Merlin and remove her darkness. However, six weeks later, they return to Storybrooke with missing memories as to how they all failed to get the darkness out of Emma except Henry. Revealed in a flashback, Henry has fallen in love with a girl named Violet; due to needing a tear from the pain of losing a first love to help free Merlin, Emma tearfully manipulates Violet into breaking Henry's heart. Due to Emma's curse, Henry gets another chance with Violet, as neither remembered each other from before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Emma restored his memory, Henry helps Emma rescue Hook after he is sent to the Underworld for sacrificing himself to save everyone. When he arrived with his family, he comes up with a new plan called \\"Operation Firebird,\\" this after learning that they have a chance to save the souls and help them move forward. However, when he comes across Cruella De Vil, he is offered a chance to help her return to the living as he is the Author, this after telling him that despite having broken the quill in two he still has the ability to use the quill and magically write her a new life while he was in the underworld and at the same time restore Emma's soul as forgiveness, but this would put Henry in a situation that would force him to break his vow not to tamper with his family history. He then learns that he has the ability to bring others back from the dead when he came across the Apprentice, whose soul can't move on until Henry makes the right choice, which is to record the events in the book. Henry plans to re-write Hades' story that was missing in the Underworld version of the \\"Once Upon a Time\\" book. He also starts experiencing visions that allows him to illustrate stories but can not explain why they're coming to him. Before he returned to Storybrooke, he finished the unfinished businesses in the book, only to have Cruella hide it in Hades' lair.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon returning to Storybrooke, Henry began to experience a roguish streak as he believed magic is destroying his family in the wake of Robin Hood's death. This prompts him and Violet to obtain the Olympian Crystal and flee to New York City, where magic can be destroyed. However, his actions also resulted in leaving Snow, David, Zelena, and Hook in the Land of Untold Stories when he used a holy grail to destroy it. Having regret what he did, Henry turned to a fountain and made a wish that he would reunite his family, and with the help of Emma, Regina, Violet, and Gold, along the New Yorkers who see him make this plea, the fountain succeeds in bringing Snow, David, Zelena, and Hook to New York and with that restored magic. Upon returning to Storybrooke, Henry learned that Violet, although born in Camelot, was actually from Connecticut, due to her father having slipped into an unknown portal. They then shared a kiss, implying that they are now a couple, as he has found his happy ending.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Henry and Regina meet with Mr. Hyde who has arrived in Storybrooke with his friends from the Land of Untold Stories, he and his family devised a plan to imprison Hyde which succeeds and later welcomes the new residents with food and shelter at Granny's. The next day Henry and Regina arrive at Granny's with a new plan called \\"Operation Cobra Part 2\\", and as Henry begins to write the names of the people of the Land of Untold Stories, a mysterious man leaves a note beside him for Snow and David revealing his name as Edmond Dants also known as the  \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\". Regina then reveals she hired him to kill them back in the Enchanted Forest and after he refuses to back down from trying to kill them Regina and Henry discover a girl named Charlotte who was Snow and David's handmaiden and who also resembled Edmond's dead fianc. The Evil Queen then reveals herself to both Henry and Regina and reveals that she has been controlling Edmond the whole time. As soon as he is about to kill Snow and David, Regina steps in to save them and after Henry's phone is frozen with magic Regina is forced to kill Edmond. Henry then realizes that this new operation will be harder as Part 1 was about giving people back their happy endings and now in Part 2 these people ran away from their stories,\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterwards, Henry has written down all the names of the new residents and he, Emma, and Hook find out Ashley's (Cinderella) step-sister Clorinda is now in town and they believe she wants to hurt but really wants to help her. After Emma's magic fails because of her hand trembling, the Evil Queen shows up and after Henry tells her to leave his mom alone she points out that she is his mother too and poofs the three of them onto a road somewhere in town to stop them from helping Ashley but they save her and her step-sister as well.

After they find Aladdin who reveals he use the \\"Shears of Destiny\\" to cut off his destiny as a savior, Emma wants to throw them away because she being the savior is what makes her special and she will not use them but Hook secretly keeps them and this causes the Evil Queen to try and cause a shift between Hook's and Henry's relationship but it fails when they both agree all they wanted to do is to protect and save Emma.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Evil Queen teams up with Mr. Gold and threatens the town with water from the River of Lost Souls, Henry along with everyone is forced to watch the Queen rip out Snow White and David's shared heart and put a twisted sleeping curse on it. After revealing that when one of them is awake and the other will be asleep, Henry agrees to lure the Evil Queen out for Emma and Regina to try to trap her and as a distraction from being nervous about taking Violet to the school dance believing she doesn't like him anymore but really is having a hard time adjusting to school and after the Evil Queen fails to darken Henry's heart by smashing the mirror instead of the Dragon's heart to save Emma and Regina.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing his mother's engagement to Killian Jones, he comes to accept the pirate as his stepfather, witnessing their marriage before the Black Fairy's new dark curse consumes the town.

He works to break this new curse, and once it does, the Final Battle results in him resuscitating Emma with True Love's Kiss. With the story done, Henry resumes his education.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason 7 begins with Henry as an adult living in Seattle, Washington. He is approached by a girl named Lucy who claims to be his daughter.

Later, it turns out that if Henry and Jacinda share true love's kiss, And break the curse, Henry will die. After wishing for her parents to be reunited for so long, only to find out the truth, Lucy tries to keep them apart, so that her father Henry will not die. Henry meets his mother Regina, who later wakes up from the curse and discovers that her son will die if the curse is removed.

Henry later regains his memories after he made a phone call that was answered by his younger self, as it turned out that the curse sent his squad back in time to before his high school graduation. He also broke the curse that restored the Hyperion Heights residents back to normal and prevented Gothel from destroying humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn season 6 episode \\"Wish You Were Here\\", the Evil Queen used one of her genie wishes to wish that Emma Swan had never even needed to become the savior. The wish created a whole new duplicate realm, known as the Wish Realm, which consists of alternate versions of the Enchanted Forest characters that come with different backstories for the 28 years after the point in which Regina never got to cast her curse. This includes an alternate version of Henry, son of Princess Emma and the late Baelfire. He is known as Sir Henry after becoming knighted by his grandparents.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a completely different backstory than his original counterpart, Henry has grown up as a member of the royal family of the Enchanted Forest, alongside his mother Princess Emma and grandparents King David and Queen Snow. When the original Emma assumes the place of her Wish Realm counterpart due to the Evil Queen's genie wish, it is the day of her birthday and when she comes across the sword destined to kill her in her visions, Henry takes it for himself, as he is preparing to be knighted. A short while later on the day of Henry's knighting ceremony, the original Regina storms the hall and kidnaps his grandparents. Regina then crushes their hearts in front of Emma to try and wake her up from her spell. Believing that Regina is actually his version of the Evil Queen who has escaped, Henry then shows up to the Evil Queen's castle and throws his sword at Regina to protect his mother, who wakes up just in time to save Regina and prevent Henry from having to commit murder.but he still did.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma and Regina then leave him as they prepare to return to the Land Without Magic but their plans are derailed when Regina gets distracted by the Wish Realm's version of Robin and their portal home closes. Regina has to continue to avoid Sir Henry during her time in the realm, but she, Emma, and the wish Robin later manage to return home through the magical wardrobe, leaving Sir Henry behind without his grandparents or a mother. Sometime later, the wish Robin and the Evil Queen return to the Wish Realm where Sir Henry believes shes the Evil Queen who killed his grandparents and tries to kill her but she and wish Robin managed to escape back to the real Enchanted Forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time later, Sir Henry has ventured outside of the Wish Realm and is about to rescue a sleeping princess from a dragon, until another guy shows up and gets to deliver True Love's Kiss to her instead. As he exits the cave, he comes across Wish Rumple, who has followed him to this new realm and wants to strike a deal. He offers to help Sir Henry get his happy ending in return for the boy's help. Knowing the man's reputation, Sir Henry turns down the deal, but Rumple tells him that the offer remains standing, shall he ever change his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rumple has managed to lure the original Henry and his family over to the Wish Realm, it is revealed that Sir Henry did eventually take his deal and is willing to help him use the author's pen to write new stories that spell out doom for the original characters. The first thing he writes is to void the Guardian's powers and in exchange, Rumple leaves Regina behind after sending the others into a snowglobe so that Sir Henry can enact revenge for the death of his grandparents.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, the deal Sir Henry made Wish Realm Rumpelstiltskin was also part of the latters plan to destroy all the realms by sending everyone to their eternal prison by allowing Sir Henry to use his emotions to create a portal that will send them to a variation of the Once Upon a Time books as their endless torture. Regina finally convinced Sir Henry that seeking vengeance and destroying everything he sees as a reason to ending everyones happiness is not worth giving in to evil, which leads to Sir Henry letting his emotions go and finally comes to his senses, effectively saving the realms and destroying the Wish Realm Rumpelstiltskins plans. Sir Henry and Regina bond as equals and became friends with his adult counterpart in helping Regina become the Queen of the United Realms.\\r\\n\\r\\nGilmore, who had previously starred in Mad Men as the third Bobby Draper from 2009 to 2011,[6][7] was cast in Once Upon a Time as Henry Mills, the \\"biological son of Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison's character) and Neal/Baelfire.

Harrison was the first president to die while in office when he caught pneumonia and died on April 4, 1841.[4] On July 9, 1850, Zachary Taylor died from acute gastroenteritis.[5] Abraham Lincoln was the first president to be assassinated. He was shot by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865.[6] Sixteen years later, on September 19, 1881, President James A. Garfield was assassinated by Charles J. Guiteau.[7] Nearly twenty years after that, President William McKinley died from complications after being shot twice by Leon Czolgosz.[8] President Warren G. Harding suffered a heart attack, and died on August 2, 1923.[9] On April 12, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt collapsed and died as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.[10] The most recent president to die in office was John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated with two rifle shots on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 26, 1841, William Henry Harrison became ill with a cold. According to the prevailing medical misconception of that time, it was believed that his illness was directly caused by the bad weather at his inauguration; however, Harrison's illness did not arise until more than three weeks after the event. The cold worsened, rapidly turning to pneumonia and pleurisy.[12] He sought to rest in the White House, but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers. His extremely busy social schedule made any rest time scarce.[13]\\r\\nHarrison's doctors tried cures, applying opium, castor oil, leeches, and Virginia snakeroot. But the treatments only made Harrison worse, and he became delirious. He died nine days after becoming ill,[14] at 12:30?am on April 4, 1841, of right lower lobe pneumonia, jaundice, and overwhelming septicemia. He was the first United States president to die in office. His last words were to his doctor, but assumed to be directed at Vice President John Tyler, \\"Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more.\\" Harrison served the shortest term of any American president: March 4?ÿ April 4, 1841, 30 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes.[15][16]\\r\\nHarrison's funeral took place in the Wesley Chapel in Cincinnati, Ohio, on April 7, 1841.[17] His original interment was in the public vault of the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. He was later buried in North Bend, Ohio. The William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial was erected in his honor.[18]\\r\\nOn July 4, 1850, Taylor was known to have consumed copious amounts of ice water, cold milk, green apples, and cherries after attending holiday celebrations and the laying of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument.[19] That same evening, he became severely ill with an unknown digestive ailment. Doctors used popular treatments of the time. Taylor died in the White House at 10:35?p.m. on July 9, five days after becoming ill.[20] Contemporary reports listed the cause of death as \\"bilious diarrhea, or a bilious cholera\\".[21] He was succeeded by Vice President Millard Fillmore.\\r\\nThe cause of Zachary Taylor's death was fully established in 2001.[22] Almost immediately after his death, rumors began to circulate that Taylor was poisoned by pro-slavery Southerners, and similar theories persisted into the twentieth century.[23] The remains were exhumed and transported to the Office of the Kentucky Chief Medical Examiner on June?17, 1991. Neutron activation analysis conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory revealed no evidence of poisoning, as arsenic levels were too low.[24][25] The analysis concluded Taylor had contracted \\"cholera morbus, or acute gastroenteritis\\", as Washington had open sewers, and his food or drink may have been contaminated.[26]\\r\\nTaylor was interred in the Public Vault of the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. from July 13, 1850 to October 25, 1850. (It was built in 1835 to hold remains of notables until either the grave site could be prepared or transportation arranged to another city.) His body was transported to the Taylor Family plot where his parents are buried, on the old Taylor homestead plantation known as 'Springfield' in Louisville, Kentucky.[27]\\r\\nThe assassination of Abraham Lincoln took place on Good Friday,[28] on April 14, 1865, as the American Civil War was drawing to a close. The assassination occurred five days after the commanding General of the Army of Northern Virginia, Robert E. Lee, surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant and the Army of the Potomac. Lincoln was the first American president to be assassinated,[29] though an unsuccessful attempt had been made on Andrew Jackson 30 years before in 1835.[30]\\r\\nThe assassination of Lincoln was planned and carried out by the well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, and a strong opponent of the abolition of slavery in the United States.[31] Booth and a group of co-conspirators originally plotted to kidnap Lincoln, but later planned to kill him, Vice President Andrew Johnson, and Secretary of State William H. Seward in a bid to help the Confederacy's cause.[32] (Vice President Johnson's assailant did not carry out his part of the plan, and Johnson succeeded Lincoln as President.)\\r\\nLincoln was shot once in the back of his head while watching the play Our American Cousin with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. at around 10:15 pm on the night of April 14, 1865.[33] An army surgeon who happened to be at Ford's, Doctor Charles Leale, assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal.[34] The unconscious President was then carried across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he remained in a coma for nine hours before dying the following morning at 7:22?a.m. on April 15.[35][36][37]\\r\\nThe assassination of James A. Garfield took place in Washington, D.C. on July 2, 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau at 9:30?am, less than four months into Garfield's term as the 20th President of the United States. Garfield died eleven weeks later on September 19, 1881. His Vice President, Chester A. Arthur, succeeded Garfield as President. Garfield also lived the longest after the shooting, compared to other assassinated Presidents. Garfield was scheduled to leave Washington on July 2, 1881 for his summer vacation.[40] On that day, Guiteau lay in wait for the President at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad station, on the southwest corner of present-day Sixth Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C.[41]\\r\\nPresident Garfield came to the Sixth Street Station on his way to his alma mater, Williams College, where he was scheduled to deliver a speech. Garfield was accompanied by two of his sons, James and Harry, and Secretary of State Blaine. Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln waited at the station to see the President off.[42] Garfield had no bodyguard or security detail; with the exception of Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, early U.S. presidents never used any guards.[43]\\r\\nAs President Garfield entered the waiting room of the station Guiteau stepped forward and pulled the trigger from behind at point-blank range. \\"My God, what is that?\\" Garfield cried out, flinging up his arms. Guiteau fired again and Garfield collapsed.[44] One bullet grazed Garfield's shoulder; the other hit him in the back, passing the first lumbar vertebra but missing the spinal cord before coming to rest behind his pancreas.[45]\\r\\nGarfield, conscious but in shock, was carried to an upstairs floor of the train station.[46] One bullet remained lodged in his body, but doctors could not find it.[47] Young Jim Garfield and James Blaine both broke down and wept. Robert Todd Lincoln, deeply upset and thinking back to the death of his father, said \\"How many hours of sorrow I have passed in this town.\\"[47]\\r\\nGarfield was carried back to the White House. Although doctors told him that he would not survive the night, the President remained conscious and alert.[48] The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery.[49] A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881.[50][51] His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.[52]\\r\\nGarfield had been a regular visitor to the shore town of Long Branch, NJ, one of the nation's premier summer vacation spots until World War I. In early September, it was decided to bring him to Elberon, a quiet beach town just to the south of Long Branch, in hopes that the beach air would help him recover. When they heard that the president was being brought to their town, local citizens built more than half a mile of tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling Garfield to be brought directly to the door of the oceanfront Franklyn cottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train station. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Rd identifies the former site of the cottage, which was demolished in 1950.\\r\\nChester Arthur was at his home in New York City on the night of September 19, when word came that Garfield had died. After first getting the news, Arthur said \\"I hopemy God, I do hope it is a mistake.\\" But confirmation by telegram came soon after. Arthur took the presidential oath of office, administered by a New York Supreme Court judge, then left for Long Branch to pay his respects before going on to Washington.[53] Garfield's body was taken to Washington, where it lay in state for two days in the Capitol Rotunda before being taken to Cleveland, where the funeral was held on September 26.[54]\\r\\nWhen the tracks that had been hastily built to the Franklyn cottage were later torn up, actor Oliver Byron bought the wooden ties, and had local carpenter William Presley build them into a small tea house, in commemoration of the president. The red & white (originally red, white & blue) \\"Garfield Tea House\\" still survives, resting a couple of blocks away from the site of the cottage on the grounds of the Long Branch Historical Museum, a former Episcopal Church. The church is nicknamed \\"The Church of the Presidents\\", as it had been attended by, in addition to Garfield, Presidents Chester A. Arthur, Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Rutherford Hayes, William McKinley, and Woodrow Wilson, during their own visits to Long Branch.\\r\\nWilliam McKinley was assassinated on September 6, 1901, inside the Temple of Music on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. McKinley was shaking hands with the public when he was shot by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist. The President died eight days later on September 14 from gangrene caused by the bullet wounds.[8]\\r\\nMcKinley had been elected for a second term in 1900.[55] He enjoyed meeting the public, and was reluctant to accept the security available to his office.[56] The Secretary to the President, George B. Cortelyou, feared an assassination attempt would take place during a visit to the Temple of Music, and twice took it off the schedule. McKinley restored it each time.[57]\\r\\nCzolgosz had lost his job during the economic Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy whose adherents had killed foreign leaders.[58] Regarding McKinley as a symbol of oppression, Czolgosz felt it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him.[59] Unable to get near McKinley during the earlier part of the presidential visit, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.[8]\\r\\nMcKinley initially appeared to be recovering, but took a turn for the worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous, and died early the next morning; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him. Roosevelt was hiking near the top of Mt. Marcy, in New York State's Adirondack region, when a runner located him to convey the bad news.[60] After McKinley's murder, for which Czolgosz was put to death in the electric chair, the United States Congress passed legislation to officially charge the Secret Service with the responsibility for protecting the president.[61]\\r\\nWarren G. Harding died from a sudden heart attack in his hotel suite while visiting San Francisco at around 7:35?p.m. on August 2, 1923. His death quickly led to theories that he had been poisoned[62] or committed suicide. Rumors of poisoning were fueled, in part, by a book called The Strange Death of President Harding, in which the author (convicted criminal, former Ohio Gang member, and detective Gaston Means, hired by Mrs. Harding to investigate Warren Harding and his mistress) suggested that Mrs. Harding had poisoned her husband after learning of his infidelity. Mrs. Harding's refusal to allow an autopsy on President Harding only added to the speculation. According to the physicians attending Harding, however, the symptoms in the days prior to his death all pointed to congestive heart failure. Harding's biographer, Samuel H. Adams, concluded that \\"Warren G. Harding died a natural death which, in any case, could not have been long postponed\\".[63]\\r\\nImmediately after President Harding's death, Mrs. Harding returned to Washington, D.C., and briefly stayed in the White House with the new President Calvin Coolidge and First Lady. For a month, former First Lady Harding gathered and destroyed by fire President Harding's correspondence and documents, both official and unofficial. Upon her return to Marion, Mrs. Harding hired a number of secretaries to collect and burn President Harding's personal papers. According to Mrs. Harding, she took these actions to protect her husband's legacy. The remaining papers were held and kept from public view by the Harding Memorial Association in Marion.[64]\\r\\nOn March 29, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt went to the Little White House at Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest before his anticipated appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations. On the afternoon of April 12, Roosevelt said, \\"I have a terrific pain in the back of my head.\\" He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president's attending cardiologist, Dr. Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive cerebral hemorrhage (stroke).[65] At 3:35?pm that day, Roosevelt died without regaining consciousness. As Allen Drury later said, \\"so ended an era, and so began another.\\" After Roosevelt's death, an editorial by The New York Times declared, \\"Men will thank God on their knees a hundred years from now that Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House\\".[66]\\r\\nIn his later years at the White House, when Roosevelt was increasingly overworked, his daughter Anna Roosevelt Boettiger had moved in to provide her father companionship and support. Anna had also arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress, the now widowed Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd. A close friend of both Roosevelt and Mercer who was present, Elizabeth Shoumatoff, rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. When Eleanor heard about her husband's death, she was also faced with the news that Anna had been arranging these meetings with Mercer and that Mercer had been with Franklin when he died.[67]\\r\\nOn the morning of April 13, Roosevelt's body was placed in a flag-draped coffin and loaded onto the presidential train. After a White House funeral on April 14, Roosevelt was transported back to Hyde Park by train, guarded by four servicemen, one each from the Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard. As was his wish, Roosevelt was buried in the Rose Garden of the Springwood estate, the Roosevelt family home in Hyde Park on April 15. Eleanor died in November 1962 and was buried next to him.[68]\\r\\nRoosevelt's death was met with shock and grief[69] across the U.S. and around the world. His declining health had not been known to the general public. Roosevelt had been president for more than 12 years, longer than any other person, and had led the country through some of its greatest crises to the impending defeat of Nazi Germany and within sight of the defeat of Japan as well.\\r\\nLess than a month after his death, on May 8, the war in Europe ended. President Harry S. Truman, who turned 61 that day, dedicated Victory in Europe Day and its celebrations to Roosevelt's memory, and kept the flags across the U.S. at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period. In doing so, Truman said that his only wish was \\"that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day.\\"[70]\\r\\nJohn F. Kennedy was assassinated at 12:30?p.m. Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC) on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas.[71][72] Kennedy was fatally shot while traveling with his wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and the latter's wife Nellie, in a Presidential motorcade. The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963ÿ1964 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald in police custody. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found that as many as 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.[73][74]\\r\\nMost current John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories put forth a criminal conspiracy involving parties as varied as the CIA, the Mafia, anti-Castro Cuban exile groups, the military industrial complex, sitting Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Cuban President Fidel Castro, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, the KGB, or some combination of those entities.[75] In an article published prior to the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, author Vincent Bugliosi estimates that a total of 42 groups, 82 assassins, and 214 people have been accused in conspiracy theories challenging the \\"lone gunman\\" theory.[76]","input":"Who was the first president to be assasinated?"},{"output":"July 4, 1776","context":"","input":""}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function P(h,t,n,c,u,o){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),i(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),i(l,null,g(o.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const x=d(M,[["render",P]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/37.md","filePath":"qapage/37.md"}'),R={name:"qapage/37.md"},D=Object.assign(R,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[b(x)]))}});export{N as __pageData,D as default};
