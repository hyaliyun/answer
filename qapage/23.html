The metal commonly used is steel, brass, or tungsten carbide.[2] It was conceived and developed as a cleaner and more reliable alternative to dip pens and fountain pens, and it is now the world&#39;s most-used writing instrument:[3] millions are manufactured and sold daily.[4] As a result, it has influenced art and graphic design and spawned an artwork genre.
Pen manufacturers produce designer ballpoint pens for the high-end and collectors&#39; markets.
The Bic Cristal is a popular disposable type of ballpoint pen whose design is recognised by its place in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.[5]


The concept of using a ball point within a writing instrument as a method of applying ink to paper has existed since the late 19th century. In these inventions, the ink was placed in a thin tube whose end was blocked by a tiny ball, held so that it could not slip into the tube or fall out of the pen.
The first patent for a ballpoint pen[6][7] was issued on 30 October 1888, to John J. Loud,[8] who was attempting to make a writing instrument that would be able to write &quot;on rough surfaces-such as wood, coarse wrapping-paper, and other articles&quot;[9] which then-common fountain pens could not. Loud&#39;s pen had a small rotating steel ball, held in place by a socket. Although it could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather, as Loud intended, it proved to be too coarse for letter-writing. With no commercial viability, its potential went unexploited[1] and the patent eventually lapsed.[10]
The manufacture of economical, reliable ballpoint pens as we know them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century.[3] Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available.[11] Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens.[4] If the ball socket was too tight, or the ink too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket was too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear.[4] Ink reservoirs pressurized by piston, spring, capillary action, and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems.[12][13]
LszlÜ‡ BrÜ‡, a Hungarian newspaper editor frustrated by the amount of time that he wasted filling up fountain pens and cleaning up smudged pages, noticed that inks used in newspaper printing dried quickly, leaving the paper dry and smudge free. He decided to create a pen using the same type of ink.[4] BrÜ‡ enlisted the help of his brother Gy?rgy, a chemist,[4] to develop viscous ink formulae for new ballpoint designs.[3]
BrÜ‡&#39;s innovation successfully coupled ink-viscosity with a ball-socket mechanism which acted compatibly to prevent ink from drying inside the reservoir while allowing controlled flow.[4] BrÜ‡ filed a British patent on 15 June 1938.[1][14]
In 1941, the BrÜ‡ brothers and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, fled Germany and moved to Argentina, where they formed BrÜ‡ Pens of Argentina and filed a new patent in 1943.[1] Their pen was sold in Argentina as the Birome (portmanteau of the names BrÜ‡ and Meyne), which is how ballpoint pens are still known in that country.[1] This new design was licensed by the British, who produced ballpoint pens for RAF aircrew as the Biro. Ballpoint pens were found to be more versatile than fountain pens, especially at high altitudes, where fountain pens were prone to ink-leakage.[4]
BrÜ‡&#39;s patent, and other early patents on ballpoint pens often used the term &quot;ball-point fountain pen&quot;.[15][16][17][18][19][20]
Following World War II, many companies vied to commercially produce their own ballpoint pen design. In post-war Argentina, success of the Birome ballpoint was limited, but in mid-1945, the Eversharp Co., a maker of mechanical pencils, teamed up with Eberhard Faber Co. to license the rights from Birome for sales in the United States.[1][10]
During the same period, American entrepreneur Milton Reynolds came across a Birome ballpoint pen during a business trip to Buenos Aires, Argentina.[1][10] Recognizing commercial potential, he purchased several ballpoint samples, returned to the United States, and founded Reynolds International Pen Company. Reynolds bypassed the Birome patent with sufficient design alterations to obtain an American patent, beating Eversharp and other competitors to introduce the pen to the U.S. market.[1][10] Debuting at Gimbels department store in New York City on 29 October 1945,[10] for US$12.50 each (1945 US dollar value, about $166 in 2016 dollars),[10] Reynolds Rocket became the first commercially successful ballpoint pen.[1][4][21] Reynolds went to great extremes to market the pen, with great success; Gimbel&#39;s sold many thousands of pens within one week. In Britain, the Miles Martin pen company was producing the first commercially successful ballpoint pens there by the end of 1945.[1]
Neither Reynolds&#39; nor Eversharp&#39;s ballpoint lived up to consumer expectations in America. Ballpoint pen sales peaked in 1946, and consumer interest subsequently plunged due to market-saturation.[10] By the early 1950s the ballpoint boom had subsided and Reynolds&#39; company folded.[1]
Paper Mate pens, among the emerging ballpoint brands of the 1950s, bought the rights to distribute their own ballpoint pens in Canada.[22] Facing concerns about ink-reliability, Paper Mate pioneered new ink formulas and advertised them as &quot;banker-approved&quot;.[10] In 1954, Parker Pens released The Jotterthe company&#39;s first ballpointboasting additional features and technological advances which also included the use of tungsten-carbide textured ball-bearings in their pens.[1] In less than a year, Parker sold several million pens at prices between three and nine dollars.[1] In the 1960s, the failing Eversharp Co. sold its pen division to Parker and ultimately folded.[1]
Marcel Bich also introduced a ballpoint pen to the American marketplace in the 1950s, licensed from BrÜ‡ and based on the Argentine designs.[3][23] Bich shortened his name to Bic in 1953, becoming the ballpoint brand now recognised globally.[4] Bic pens struggled until the company launched its &quot;Writes The First Time, Every Time!&quot; advertising campaign in the 1960s.[4] Competition during this era forced unit prices to drop considerably.[4]
Ballpoint pens are produced in both disposable and refillable models. Refills allow for the entire internal ink reservoir, including a ballpoint and socket, to be replaced. Such characteristics are usually associated with designer-type pens or those constructed of finer materials. The simplest types of ballpoint pens are disposable and have a cap to cover the tip when the pen is not in use, or a mechanism for retracting the tip,[3] which varies between manufacturers but is usually a spring- or screw-mechanism.
Rollerball pens employ the same ballpoint mechanics, but with the use of water-based inks instead of oil-based inks. Compared to oil-based ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the water-based inks will blot if held stationary against the writing surface. Water-based inks also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to smearingposing problems to left-handed people (or right handed people writing right-to-left script)and running, should the writing surface become wet.
Because of a ballpoint pen&#39;s reliance on gravity to coat the ball with ink, most cannot be used to write upside-down. However, technology developed by Fisher pens in the United States resulted in the production of what came to be known as the &quot;Fisher Space Pen&quot;. Space Pens combine a more viscous ink with a pressurised ink reservoir[4] that forces the ink toward the point. Unlike standard ballpoints, the rear end of a Space Pen&#39;s pressurized reservoir is sealed, eliminating evaporation and leakage,[4] thus allowing the pen to write upside-down, in zero-gravity environments, and reportedly underwater.[24] Astronauts have made use of these pens in outer space.[4]
Ballpoint pens with &quot;erasable ink&quot; were pioneered by the Paper Mate pen company.[25] The ink formulas of erasable ballpoints have properties similar to rubber cement, allowing the ink to be literally rubbed clean from the writing surface before drying and eventually becoming permanent.[25] Erasable ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks, requiring pressurised cartridges to facilitate inkflowmeaning they can also write upside-down. Though these pens are equipped with erasers, any eraser will suffice.[25]
The inexpensive, disposable Bic Cristal (also simply Bic pen or Biro) is reportedly the most widely sold pen in the world.[23][26] It was the Bic company&#39;s first product and is still synonymous with the company name.[27][28] The Bic Cristal is part of the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, acknowledged for its industrial design.[5][26] Its hexagonal barrel mimics that of a wooden pencil and is transparent, showing the ink level in the reservoir. Originally a sealed streamlined cap, the modern pen cap has a small hole at the top to meet safety standards, helping to prevent suffocation if children suck it into the throat.[29]
Multipens are pens that feature multiple varying colored ballpoint refills. Sometimes ballpoint refills are combined with another non-ballpoint refill.
Ballpoint pens are sometimes provided free by businesses, such as hotels, as a form of advertisingprinted with a company&#39;s name; a ballpoint pen is a relatively low cost advertisement that is highly effective (customers will use, and therefore see, a pen daily). Businesses and charities include ballpoint pens in direct mail campaigns to increase a customer&#39;s interest in the mailing. Ballpoints have also been produced to commemorate events, such as a pen commemorating the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.[3]
Ballpoint pens have proven to be a versatile art medium for professional artists as well as amateur doodlers.[30] Low cost, availability, and portability are cited by practitioners as qualities which make this common writing tool a convenient, alternative art supply.[31] Some artists use them within mixed-media works, while others use them solely as their medium-of-choice.[32]
Effects not generally associated with ballpoint pens can be achieved.[33] Traditional pen-and-ink techniques such as stippling and cross-hatching can be used to create half-tones[34] or the illusion of form and volume.[35] For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush.[36] Finely applied, the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork[37] and photography,[38] causing reactions of disbelief which ballpoint artist Lennie Mace refers to as the Wow Factor.[36][37]
Famous 20th-century artists such as Andy Warhol, among others, have utilised ballpoint pens to some extent during their careers.[39] Ballpoint pen artwork continues to attract interest in the 21st century, with contemporary artists gaining recognition for their specific use of ballpoint pens; for their technical proficiency, imagination, and innovation. Korean-American artist Il Lee has been creating large-scale, ballpoint-only abstract artwork since the late 1970s.[30] Since the 1980s, Lennie Mace creates imaginative, ballpoint-only artwork of varying content and complexity, applied to unconventional surfaces including wood and denim.[40] The artist coined terms such as PENtings and Media Graffiti to describe his varied output.[36] More recently, British artist James Mylne has been creating photo-realistic artwork using mostly black ballpoints, sometimes with minimal mixed-media color.[38] In the mid-2000s (decade), Juan Francisco Casas generated Internet attention for a series of large-scale, photo-realistic ballpoint duplications of his own snapshots of friends, utilising only blue pens.[41]
Using ballpoint pens to create artwork is not without limitations. Color availability and sensitivity of ink to light are among concerns of ballpoint pen artists.[42] Mistakes pose greater risks to ballpoint artists; once a line is drawn, it generally cannot be erased.[36] Additionally, &quot;blobbing&quot; of ink on the drawing surface and &quot;skipping&quot; of ink-flow require consideration when using ballpoint pens for artistic purposes.[32] Although the mechanics of ballpoint pens remain relatively unchanged, ink composition has evolved to solve certain problems over the years, resulting in unpredictable sensitivity to light and some extent of fading.[42]
Although designs and construction vary between brands, basic components of all ballpoint pens are universal.[3] Standard components of a ballpoint tip include the freely rotating ball itself (distributing the ink on the writing surface), a socket holding the ball in place, small ink channels that provide ink to the ball through the socket, and a self-contained ink reservoir supplying ink to the ball.[4] In modern disposable pens, narrow plastic tubes contain the ink, which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity.[4] Brass, steel, or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points,[4] then housed in a brass socket.[43]
The function of these components can be compared with the ball-applicator of roll-on antiperspirant; the same technology at a larger scale. The ball point tip delivers the ink to the writing surface while acting as a buffer between the ink in the reservoir and the air outside, preventing the quick-drying ink from drying inside the reservoir. Modern ballpoints are said to have a two-year shelf life, on average.[4]
A ballpoint tip that can write comfortably for a long period of time is not easy to produce as it requires high-precision machinery and thin high grade steel alloy plates. China that currently (2017) produces about 80 percent of the world&#39;s ballpoint pens relied up to 2017 on imported ballpoint tips and metal alloys.[44]
The common ballpoint pen is a product of mass production, with components produced separately on assembly lines.[43] Basic steps in the manufacturing process include production of ink formulas, moulding of metal and plastic components, and assembly.[3] Marcel Bich was involved in developing the production of inexpensive ballpoint pens.[4]
The International Organization for Standardization has published standards for ball point and roller ball pens:
The world&#39;s largest functioning ballpoint pen was made by Acharya Makunuri Srinivasa in India. The pen measures 5.5 m (18 ft 0.53 in) long and weighs 37.23 kg (82.08 lb 1.24 oz).[50]</div></div><div class="card" data-v-77bf5ffc><div class="question" data-v-77bf5ffc>What kind of economic system does france have?</div><div class="separator" data-v-77bf5ffc></div><div class="answer" data-v-77bf5ffc>SocialistðŸš¨France has the world&#39;s 6th largest economy[better?source?needed] by nominal figures and the 10th largest economy by PPP figures. It has the 3rd-largest economy in Europe with the UK in 2nd and Germany in 1st.[17] The OECD is headquartered in Paris, the nation&#39;s financial capital.
The chemical industry is a key sector for France, helping to develop other manufacturing activities and contributing to economic growth.[18] France&#39;s tourism industry is a major component of the economy, as France is the most visited destination in the world.[19][20] Sophia Antipolis is the major technology hub for the economy of France. According to the IMF, in 2013, France was the world&#39;s 20th country by GDP per capita with $44,099 per inhabitant. In 2013, France was listed on the United Nations&#39;s Human Development Index with 0.884 (very high human development) and 25th on the Corruption Perceptions Index.
France&#39;s economy entered the recession of the late 2000s later and appeared to leave it earlier than most affected economies, only enduring four-quarters of contraction.[21] However, France experienced stagnant growth between 2012 and 2014, with the economy expanding by 0% in 2012, 0.8% in 2013 and 0.2% in 2014, though growth picked up in 2015 with a growth of 0.8% and a growth of 1.1% for 2016, and a forecasted growth of 1.6% for 2017 and 1.8% for 2018, both forecast growth to each being the highest since 2011 (2.1%).[22]


With 31 of the 500 biggest companies of the world in 2015, France ranks 4th in the Fortune Global 500, behind the USA, China and Japan.
Several French corporations rank amongst the largest in their industries such as AXA in insurance and Air France in air transportation.[23] Luxury and consumer good are particularly relevant, with L&#39;Oreal being the world&#39;s largest cosmetic company while LVMH and PPR are the world&#39;s two largest luxury product companies. In energy and utilities, GDF-Suez and EDF are amongst the largest energy companies in the world, and Areva is a large nuclear-energy company; Veolia Environnement is the world&#39;s largest environmental services and water management company; Vinci SA, Bouygues and Eiffage are large construction companies; Michelin ranks in the top 3 tire manufacturers; JCDecaux is the world&#39;s largest outdoor advertising corporation; BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale rank amongst the largest in the world by assets.
Carrefour is the world&#39;s second largest retail group in terms of revenue; Total is the world&#39;s fourth largest private oil company; Danone is the world&#39;s fifth largest food company and the world&#39;s largest supplier of mineral water; Sanofi Aventis is the world&#39;s fifth largest pharmaceutical company; Publicis is the world&#39;s third largest advertising company; PSA is the world&#39;s 6th and Europe&#39;s 2nd largest automaker; Accor is the leading European hotel group; Alstom is one of the world&#39;s leading conglomerates in rail transport.
France embarked on an ambitious and very successful programme of modernization under state coordination. This programme of dirigisme, mostly implemented by governments between 1944 and 1983, involved the state control of certain industries such as transportation, energy and telecommunications as well as various incentives for private corporations to merge or engage in certain projects.
The 1981 election of president Fran?ois Mitterrand saw a short-lived increase in governmental control of the economy, nationalising many industries and private banks. This form of increased dirigisme, was criticised as early as 1982. By 1983, the government decided to renounce dirigisme and start an era of rigueur (&quot;rigour&quot;) or corporatization. As a result, the government largely retreated from economic intervention; dirigisme has now essentially receded, though some of its traits remain. The French economy grew and changed under government direction and planning much more than in other European countries.
Despite being a widely liberalized economy, the government continues to play a significant role in the economy: government spending, at 56% of GDP in 2014, is the second highest in the European Union. Labour conditions and wages are highly regulated. The government continues to own shares in corporations in a range of sectors, including banking, energy production and distribution, automobiles, transportation, and telecommunications. These differ from countries such as the US or UK where most of these companies have been privatized.
In April and May 2012, France held a presidential election in which the winner Fran?ois Hollande had opposed austerity measures, promising to eliminate France&#39;s budget deficit by 2017. The new government stated that it aimed to cancel recently enacted tax cuts and exemptions for the wealthy, raising the top tax bracket rate to 75% on incomes over a million euros, restoring the retirement age to 60 with a full pension for those who have worked 42 years, restoring 60,000 jobs recently cut from public education, regulating rent increases; and building additional public housing for the poor.
In June 2012, Hollande&#39;s Socialist Party won an overall majority in the legislative elections, giving it the capability to amend the French Constitution and allowing immediate enactment of the promised reforms. French government bond interest rates fell 30% to record lows,[24] less than 50 basis points above German government bond rates.[25]
The French government has run a budget deficit each year since the early 1970s. In mid-2012, French government debt levels reached ?1,833?billion.[26] This debt level was the equivalent of 91% of French GDP.[26]
Under European Union rules, member states are supposed to limit their debt to 60% of output or be reducing the ratio structurally towards this ceiling, and run public deficits of no more than 3.0% of GDP.[26]
In late 2012, credit-rating agencies warned that growing French government debt levels risked France&#39;s AAA credit rating, raising the possibility of a future credit downgrade and subsequent higher borrowing costs for the French government.[27]
In 2012 France was downgraded by ratings agencies Moody&#39;s, Standard&amp;Poor&#39;s, and Fitch to the AA+ credit rating.[28][29]
In December 2014 France&#39;s credit rating was further downgraded by Fitch (and S&amp;P) to the AA credit rating.[30]
2006 electricity production of France
The leading industrial sectors in France are telecommunications (including communication satellites), aerospace and defense, ship building (naval and specialist ships), pharmaceuticals, construction and civil engineering, chemicals, textiles, and automobile production.
Research and development spending is also high in France at 2.26% of GDP, the fourth-highest in the OECD.[31]
France is the world-leading country in nuclear energy, home of global energy giants Areva, EDF and GDF Suez: nuclear power now accounts for about 78% of the country&#39;s electricity production, up from only 8% in 1973, 24% in 1980, and 75% in 1990. Nuclear waste is stored on site at reprocessing facilities. Due to its heavy investment in nuclear power, France is the smallest emitter of carbon dioxide among the seven most industrialized countries in the world.[32]
In 2006 electricity generated in France amounted to 548.8 TWh, of which:[33]
In November 2004, EDF (which stands for Electricit de France), the world&#39;s largest utility company and France&#39;s largest electricity provider, was floated with huge success on the French stock market. Notwistanding, the French state still keeps 70% of the capital.
Other electricity providers include Compagnie nationale du Rh?ne (CNR) and Endesa (through SNET).
France is the world&#39;s sixth largest agricultural producer and EU&#39;s leading agricultural power, accounting for about one-third of all agricultural land within the EU.
Northern France is characterized by large wheat farms. Dairy products, pork, poultry, and apple production are concentrated in the western region. Beef production is located in central France, while the production of fruits, vegetables, and wine ranges from central to southern France. France is a large producer of many agricultural products and is currently expanding its forestry and fishery industries. The implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have resulted in reforms in the agricultural sector of the economy.
As the world&#39;s second-largest agricultural exporter, France ranks just after the United States.[34] The destination of 49% of its exports is other EU members states. France also provide agricultural exports to many poor African countries (including its former colonies) which face serious food shortages. Wheat, beef, pork, poultry, and dairy products are the principal exports.
Exports from the United States face stiff competition from domestic production, other EU member states, and third-world countries in France. US agricultural exports to France, totaling some $600?million annually, consist primarily of soybeans and soybean products, feeds and fodders, seafood, and consumer products, especially snack foods and nuts. French exports to the United States are much more high-value products such as its cheese, processed products and its wine.
The French agricultural sector receives almost ?11?billion in EU subsidies. France&#39;s competitive advantage is mostly linked to the high quality and global renown of its produce, such as cheese and wine.
France is the most popular tourist destination with more than 83.7?million foreign tourists in 2014,[7] ahead of Spain (58.5?million in 2006) and the United States (51.1?million in 2006). This figure excludes people staying less than 24 hours in France, such as northern Europeans crossing France on their way to Spain or Italy during the summer.
France is home to cities of much cultural interest (Paris being the foremost), beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, and rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity. France also attracts many religious pilgrims to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrnes dpartement, which hosts several million visitors a year.
According to figures from 2003, some popular tourist sites include (in visitors per year):[35] Eiffel Tower (6.2?million), Louvre Museum (5.7?million), Palace of Versailles (2.8?million), Muse d&#39;Orsay (2.1?million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2?million), Centre Pompidou (1.2?million), Mont-Saint-Michel (1?million), Chateau de Chambord (711,000), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Chateau du Haut-K?nigsbourg (549,000), Puy de D?me (500,000), Muse Picasso (441,000), Carcassonne (362,000).
The French arms industry&#39;s main customer, for whom they mainly build warships, guns, nuclear weapons and equipment, is the French government.
Record high defence expenditure (currently at ?35?billion), which was considerably increased under the government of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, goes largely to the French arms industries.
During the 2000Ã¿2015 period, France was the fourth largest weapons exporter in the world[36][37]
French manufacturers export great quantities of weaponry to the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Greece, India, Pakistan, Taiwan, Singapore and many others.
It was reported that in 2015, French arms sales internationally amounted to 17.4?billion U.S. dollars,[38] more than double the figure of 2014.[39] Vice News explained that &quot;While the United Kingdom has lapsed somewhat in this regard, France has maintained a high-level of production of military equipment for land, air, and sea defense Ã¿ an expensive approach that relies on the export of arms and technology.&quot;[40]
Transportation in France relies on one of the densest networks in the world with 146?km of road and 6.2?km of rail lines per 100?km2. It is built as a web with Paris at its center.[41] The highly subsidised rail transport network makes up a relatively small portion of travel, most of which is done by car. However the high-speed TGV trains make up a large proportion of long-distance travel, partially because intercity buses were prevented from operating until 2015.
France also boasts a number of seaports and harbours, including Bayonne, Bordeaux, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Brest, Calais, Cherbourg-Octeville, Dunkerque, Fos-sur-Mer, La Pallice, Le Havre, Lorient, Marseille, Nantes, Nice, Paris, Port-la-Nouvelle, Port-Vendres, Roscoff, Rouen, Saint-Nazaire, Saint-Malo, Ste, Strasbourg and Toulon. There are approximately 478 airports in France (1999 est.) and by a 2005 estimate, there are three heliports. 288 of the airports have paved runways, with the remaining 199 being unpaved. The national carrier of France is Air France, a full service global airline which flies to 20 domestic destinations and 150 international destinations in 83 countries (including Overseas departments and territories of France) across all 6 major continents.
According to a 2011 report by the American Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), France&#39;s GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is similar to that of the UK, with just over US$35,000 per head.[42] To explain why French per capita GDP is lower than that of the United States, the economist Paul Krugman stated that &quot;French workers are roughly as productive as US workers&quot;, but that the French have allegedly a lower workforce participation rate and &quot;when they work, they work fewer hours&quot;. According to Krugman, the difference is due to the French making &quot;different choices about retirement and leisure&quot;.[43]
Keynesian economists sought out different solutions to the unemployment issue in France, and their theories led to the introduction of the 35-hour workweek law in 1999. Between 2004 and 2008, the government attempted to combat unemployment with supply-side reforms, but was met with fierce resistance;[44] the contrat nouvelle embauche and the contrat premire embauche (which allowed more flexible contracts) were of particular concern, and both were eventually repealed.[45] The Sarkozy government used the revenu de solidarit active (in-work benefits) to redress the allegedly negative effect of the revenu minimum d&#39;insertion (unemployment benefits which do not depend on previous contributions, unlike normal unemployment benefits in France) on the incentive to accept even jobs which are insufficient to earn a living.[46]
French employment rates for 15Ã¿64 years is one of the lowest of the OECD countries: in 2012, only 71% of the French population aged 15Ã¿64 years were in employment, compared to 74% in Japan, 77% in the UK, 73% in the US and 77% in Germany.[47] This gap is due to the low employment rate for 15Ã¿24 years old: 38% in 2012, compared to 47% in the OECD. Neoliberal economists attribute the low employment rate, particularly evident among young people, to allegedly high minimum wages that would prevent low productivity workers from easily entering the labour market.[48]
A December 2012 New York Times article reported on an allegedly &quot;floating generation&quot; in France that formed part of the 14 million unemployed young Europeans documented by the Eurofound research agency.[49] In the same article, Anne Sonnet, a senior economist studying unemployment at the OECD claimed that nearly two million young people in France had given up looking for employment at that time, while French labour minister Michel Sapin said that 82 percent of people hired were only on temporary contracts. Sapin further explained that, in his opinion, the challenge at that time was to create a more flexible system, in which greater trust existed between unions and companies, and &quot;partial unemployment&quot; was accommodated during difficult periods. The so-called floating generation was attributed to an allegedly dysfunctional system: &quot;an elitist educational tradition that does not integrate graduates into the work force, a rigid labour market that is hard to enter for newcomers, and a tax system that makes it expensive for companies to hire full-time employees and both difficult and expensive to lay them off&quot;.[50] In July 2013, the unemployment rate for France was 11%.[51]
In early April 2014, employers&#39; federations and unions negotiated an agreement with technology and consultancy employers, as employees had been experiencing an extension of their work time through smartphone communication outside of official working hours. Under a new, legally binding labour agreement, around 250,000 employees will avoid handling work-related matters during their leisure time and their employers will, in turn, refrain from engaging with staff during this time.[52]
Everyday, about 80,000 French citizens are commuting to work in neighbouring Luxembourg, making it the biggest cross-border workforce group in the whole of the European Union.[53] They are attracted by much higher wages for the different job groups than in their own country and the lack of skilled labour in the booming Luxembourgish economy.
France is the second-largest trading nation in Europe (after Germany).[54] Its foreign trade balance for goods had been in surplus from 1992 until 2001, reaching $25.4 billion (25.4 G$) in 1998; however, the French balance of trade was hit by the economic downturn, and went into the red in 2000, reaching a US$15bn deficit in 2003. Total trade for 1998 amounted to $730?billion, or 50% of GDPimports plus exports of goods and services. Trade with European Union countries accounts for 60% of French trade.
In 1998, USÃ¿France trade stood at about $47?billion Ã¿ goods only. According to French trade data, US exports accounted for 8.7% Ã¿ about $25?billion Ã¿ of France&#39;s total imports. US industrial chemicals, aircraft and engines, electronic components, telecommunications, computer software, computers and peripherals, analytical and scientific instrumentation, medical instruments and supplies, broadcasting equipment, and programming and franchising are particularly attractive to French importers.
The principal French exports to the US are aircraft and engines, beverages, electrical equipment, chemicals, cosmetics, luxury products and perfume. France is the ninth-largest trading partner of the US.

The economic disparity between French regions is not as high as that in other European countries such as the UK, Italy or Germany, and higher than in countries like Sweden or Denmark, or even Spain. However, Europe&#39;s wealthiest and second largest regional economy, Ile-de-France (the region surrounding Paris), has long profited from the capital city&#39;s economic hegemony.
The most important rgions are Ile-de-France (world&#39;s 4th and Europe 2nd wealthiest and largest regional economy), Rh?ne-Alpes (Europe&#39;s 5th largest regional economy thanks to its services, high-technologies, chemical industries, wines, tourism), Provence-Alpes-C?te d&#39;Azur (services, industry, tourism and wines), Nord-Pas-de-Calais (European transport hub, services, industries) and Pays de la Loire (green technologies, tourism).
Rgions like Alsace, which has a rich past in industry (machine tool) and currently stands as a high income service-specialized region, are very wealthy without ranking very high in absolute terms.
The rural areas are mainly in Auvergne, Limousin, and Centre-Val de Loire, and wine production accounts for a significant proportion of the economy in Aquitaine (Bordeaux (or claret)), Burgundy, and champagne produced in Champagne-Ardennes.

In terms of income, important inequalities can be observed among the French dpartements.
According to the 2008 statistics of the INSEE, the Yvelines is the highest income dpartement of the country with an average income of ?4,750 per month. Hauts-de-Seine comes second, Essonne third, Paris fourth, Seine-et Marne fifth.
Ile-de-France is the wealthiest region in the country with an average income of ?4,228 per month (and is also the wealthiest region in Europe) compared to ?3,081 at the national level. Alsace comes second, Rh?ne-Alpes third, Picardy fourth, and Upper Normandy fifth.
The poorest parts of France are the French overseas dpartements, French Guiana being the poorest dpartement with an average household income of ?1,826. In metropolitan France it is Creuse in the Limousin region which comes bottom of the list with an average household income of ?1,849 per month.[55]
Huge inequalities can also be found among cities. In the Paris metropolitan area, significant differences exist between the higher standard of living of Paris Ouest and lower standard of living in areas in the northern banlieues of Paris such as Seine-Saint-Denis.
For cities of over 50,000 inhabitants, Neuilly-sur-Seine, a western suburb of Paris, is the wealthiest city in France with an average household income of ?5,939, and 35% earning more than ?8,000 per month.[56] But within Paris, four arrondissements surpass wealthy Neuilly-sur-Seine in household income: the 6th, the 7th, the 8th and the 16th; the 8th &quot;arrondissement&quot; being the wealthiest district in France (the other three following it closely as 2nd, 3rd and 4th wealthiest ones).
In 2010, the French had an estimated wealth of US$14.0?trillion for a population of 63 million.[57]
France has the third highest number of millionaires in Europe as of 2015. There were 1.8?million millionaire households (measured in terms of US dollars) living in France in 2015, behind the UK (2.4M) and Germany (1.5M).[64]
The world&#39;s wealthiest woman and France&#39;s richest person is French L&#39;Oreal cosmetic empire heiress Liliane Bettencourt. The wealthiest man in France is the LVMH CEO and owner Bernard Arnault.

Cracticus tibicen
The Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) is a medium-sized black and white passerine bird native to Australia and southern New Guinea. Although once considered to be three separate species, it is now considered to be one, with nine recognised subspecies. A member of the Artamidae, the Australian magpie is placed in its own genus Gymnorhina and is most closely related to the black butcherbird (Melloria quoyi). It is not, however, closely related to the European magpie, which is a corvid.
The adult Australian magpie is a fairly robust bird ranging from 37 to 43?cm (14.5 to 17?in) in length, with distinctive black and white plumage, gold brown eyes and a solid wedge-shaped bluish-white and black bill. The male and female are similar in appearance, and can be distinguished by differences in back markings. The male has pure white feathers on the back of the head and the female has white blending to grey feathers on the back of the head. With its long legs, the Australian magpie walks rather than waddles or hops and spends much time on the ground.
Described as one of Australia&#39;s most accomplished songbirds, the Australian magpie has an array of complex vocalisations. It is omnivorous, with the bulk of its varied diet made up of invertebrates. It is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range. Common and widespread, it has adapted well to human habitation and is a familiar bird of parks, gardens and farmland in Australia and New Guinea. This species is commonly fed by households around the country, but in spring a small minority of breeding magpies (almost always males) become aggressive and swoop and attack those who approach their nests.
Over 1000 Australian magpies were introduced into New Zealand from 1864 to 1874[2] but have subsequently been accused of displacing native birds and are now treated as a pest species.[3] Introductions also occurred in the Solomon Islands and Fiji, where the birds are not considered an invasive species. The Australian magpie is the mascot of several Australian sporting teams, most notably the Collingwood Magpies, the Western Suburbs Magpies and Port Adelaide Magpies.


The Australian magpie was first described by English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 as Coracias tibicen, the type collected in the Port Jackson region.[4][a] Its specific epithet derived from the Latin tibicen &quot;flute-player&quot; or &quot;piper&quot; in reference to the bird&#39;s melodious call.[6][7] An early recorded vernacular name is piping poller, written on a painting by Thomas Watling, one of a group known collectively as the Port Jackson Painter,[8] sometime between 1788 and 1792.[9] Tarra-won-nang,[8] or djarrawunang, wibung, and marriyang were names used by the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney Basin.[10] Booroogong and garoogong were Wiradjuri words, and carrak was a Jardwadjali term from Victoria.[11] Among the Kamilaroi, it is burrugaabu,[12] galalu, or guluu.[13] It was known as Warndurla among the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara.[14] Other names used include piping crow-shrike, piper, maggie, flute-bird and organ-bird.[7] The term bell-magpie was proposed to help distinguish it from the European magpie but failed to gain wide acceptance.[15]
The bird was named for its similarity in colouration to the European magpie; it was a common practice for early settlers to name plants and animals after European counterparts.[9] However, the European magpie is a member of the Corvidae, while its Australian counterpart is placed in the family Artamidae (although both are members of a broad corvid lineage). The Australian magpie&#39;s affinities with butcherbirds and currawongs were recognised early on and the three genera were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by John Albert Leach after he had studied their musculature.[16] American ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between woodswallows and the butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade,[17] in the Artamidae.[18] The Australian magpie is placed in its own monotypic genus Gymnorhina which was introduced by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1840.[19][20] The name of the genus is from the Ancient Greek gumnos for &quot;naked&quot; or &quot;bare&quot; and rhis, rhinos &quot;nostrils&quot;.[21] Some authorities such as Glen Storr in 1952 and Leslie Christidis and Walter Boles in their 2008 checklist, have placed the Australian magpie in the butcherbird genus Cracticus, arguing that its adaptation to ground-living is not enough to consider it a separate genus.[18][22] A molecular genetic study published in a 2013 showed that the Australian magpie is a sister taxon to the black butcherbird (Melloria quoyi) and that the two species are in turn sister to a clade that includes the other butcherbirds in the genus Cracticus. The ancestor to the two species is thought to have split from the other butcherbirds between 8.3 and 4.2 million years ago, during the late Miocene to early Pliocene, while the two species themselves diverged sometime during the Pliocene (5.8Ã¿3.0 million years ago).[23]
The Australian magpie was subdivided into three species in the literature for much of the twentieth centurythe black-backed magpie (G. tibicen), the white-backed magpie (G. hypoleuca), and the western magpie (G. dorsalis).[24] They were later noted to hybridise readily where their territories crossed, with hybrid grey or striped-backed magpies being quite common. This resulted in them being reclassified as one species by Julian Ford in 1969,[25] with most recent authors following suit.[18]
There are currently thought to be nine subspecies of the Australian magpie, although there are large zones of overlap with intermediate forms between the taxa. There is a tendency for birds to become larger with increasing latitude, the southern subspecies being larger than those further north, except the Tasmanian form which is small.[26] The original form, known as the black-backed magpie and classified as Gymnorhina tibicen, has been split into four black-backed races:
The white-backed magpie, originally described as Gymnorhina hypoleuca by John Gould in 1837, has also been split into races:
The adult magpie is a fairly solid, sturdy bird ranging from 37 to 43?cm (14.5 to 17?in) in length with a 65Ã¿85?cm (25.5Ã¿33.5?in) wingspan, and weighing 220Ã¿350?g (7.8Ã¿12.3?oz).[29] Its robust wedge-shaped bill is bluish-white bordered with black, with a small hook at the tip. The black legs are long and strong.[36] The plumage is pure glossy black and white; both sexes of all subspecies have black heads, wings and underparts with white shoulders. The tail has a black terminal band. The nape is white in the male and light greyish-white in the female. Mature magpies have dull red eyes, in contrast to the yellow eyes of currawongs and white eyes of Australian ravens and crows.[37] The main difference between the subspecies lies in the &quot;saddle&quot; markings on the back below the nape. Black-backed subspecies have a black saddle and white nape.[29] White-backed subspecies have a wholly white nape and saddle. The male Western Australian subspecies dorsalis is also white-backed, but the equivalent area in the female is scalloped black.[37]
Juveniles have lighter greys and browns amidst the starker blacks and whites of their plumage;[38] two- or three-year-old birds of both sexes closely resemble and are difficult to distinguish from adult females.[36] Immature birds have dark brownish eyes until around two years of age.[36] Australian magpies generally live to around 25 years of age,[39] though ages of up to 30 years have been recorded.[40] The reported age of first breeding has varied according to area, but the average is between the ages of three and five years.[41]
Well-known and easily recognisable, the Australian magpie is unlikely to be confused with any other species. The pied butcherbird has a similar build and plumage, but has white underparts unlike the former species&#39; black underparts. The magpie-lark is a much smaller and more delicate bird with complex and very different banded black and white plumage. Currawong species have predominantly dark plumage and heavier bills.[37]
One of Australia&#39;s most highly regarded songbirds, the Australian magpie has a wide variety of calls, many of which are complex. Pitch may vary over up to four octaves,[42] and the bird can mimic over 35 species of native and introduced bird species, as well as dogs and horses.[43] Magpies have even been noted to mimic human speech when living in close proximity to humans.[44] Its complex, musical, warbling call is one of the most familiar Australian bird sounds. In Denis Glover&#39;s poem &quot;The Magpies&quot;, the mature magpie&#39;s call is described as quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle,[45] one of the most famous lines in New Zealand poetry, and as waddle giggle gargle paddle poodle, in the children&#39;s book Waddle Giggle Gargle by Pamela Allen.[46]
When alone, a magpie may make a quiet musical warbling; these complex melodious warbles or subsongs are pitched at 2Ã¿4 KHz and do not carry for long distances. These songs have been recorded up to 70 minutes in duration and are more frequent after the end of the breeding season.[47] Pairs of magpies often take up a loud musical calling known as carolling to advertise or defend their territory; one bird initiates the call with the second (and sometimes more) joining in.[48] Often preceded by warbling,[43] carolling is pitched between 6 and 8?kHz and has 4Ã¿5 elements with slurring indistinct noise in between.[49] Birds will adopt a specific posture by tilting their heads back, expanding their chests, and moving their wings backwards.[50] A group of magpies will sing a short repetitive version of carolling just before dawn (dawn song), and at twilight after sundown (dusk song), in winter and spring.[43]
Fledgling and juvenile magpies emit a repeated short and loud (80 dB), high-pitched (8?kHz) begging call.[51] Magpies may indulge in beak-clapping to warn other species of birds.[52] They employ several high pitched (8Ã¿10?kHz) alarm or rallying calls when intruders or threats are spotted. Distinct calls have been recorded for the approach of eagles and monitor lizards.[53]
The Australian magpie is found in the Trans-Fly region of southern New Guinea, between the Oriomo River and Muli Strait, and across most of Australia, bar the tip of Cape York,[54] the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts, and southwest of Tasmania.[55] Birds taken mainly from Tasmania and Victoria were introduced into New Zealand by local Acclimatisation Societies of Otago and Canterbury in the 1860s, with the Wellington Acclimatisation Society releasing 260 birds in 1874. White-backed forms are spread on both the North and eastern South Island, while black-backed forms are found in the Hawke&#39;s Bay region.[56] Magpies were introduced into New Zealand to control agricultural pests, and were therefore a protected species until 1951.[57] They are thought to affect native New Zealand bird populations such as the tui and kerer, sometimes raiding nests for eggs and nestlings,[57] although studies by Waikato University have cast doubt on this,[58] and much blame on the magpie as a predator in the past has been anecdotal only.[59] Introductions also occurred in the Solomon Islands and Sri Lanka, although the species has failed to become established. It has become established in western Taveuni in Fiji, however.[56]
The Australian magpie prefers open areas such as grassland, fields and residential areas such as parks, gardens, golf courses, and streets, with scattered trees or forest nearby. Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly on the ground in these open areas.[60] It has also been recorded in mature pine plantations; birds only occupy rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in the vicinity of cleared areas.[54] In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) have been implicated.[61]
The Australian magpie is almost exclusively diurnal, although it may call into the night, like some other members of the Artamidae.[62] Natural predators of magpies include various species of monitor lizard and the barking owl.[63] Birds are often killed on roads or electrocuted by powerlines, or poisoned after killing and eating house sparrows or mice, rats or rabbits targeted with baiting.[64] The Australian raven may take nestlings left unattended.[65]
On the ground, the Australian magpie moves around by walking, and is the only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short femur (thigh bone), and long lower leg below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, although birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.[66]
The magpie is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy and defend the same territory for many years.[64] Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a raptor results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves either side of the bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory.[67] A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the negotiating display, the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory while the rest of the group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a group strength display, employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory.[68] The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie&#39;s group.[69]
A wide variety of displays are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones.[70] Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission.[71] The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings.[72] A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts.[72] Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack.[73] Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting to bring down the leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.[74]
Magpies have a long breeding season which varies in different parts of the country; in northern parts of Australia they will breed between June and September, but not commence until August or September in cooler regions, and may continue until January in some alpine areas.[75] The nest is a bowl-shaped structure made of sticks and lined with softer material such as grass and bark. Near human habitation, synthetic material may be incorporated.[76] Nests are built exclusively by females and generally placed high up in a tree fork, often in an exposed position.[77] The trees used are most commonly eucalypts, although a variety of other native trees as well as introduced pine, Crataegus, and elm have been recorded.[78] Other bird species, such as the yellow-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza chrysorrhoa), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), southern whiteface (Aphelocephala leucopsis), and (less commonly) noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), often nest in the same tree as the magpie. The first two species may even locate their nest directly beneath a magpie nest, while the diminutive striated pardalote (Pardalotus striatus) has been known to make a burrow for breeding into the base of the magpie nest itself. These incursions are all tolerated by the magpies.[79] The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) is a notable brood parasite in eastern Australia; magpies will raise cuckoo young, which eventually outcompete the magpie nestlings.[80]
The Australian magpie produces a clutch of two to five light blue or greenish eggs, which are oval in shape and about 30 by 40?mm (1.2 by 1.6?in).[81] The chicks hatch synchronously around 20 days after incubation begins; like all passerines, the chicks are altricialthey are born pink, naked, and blind with large feet, a short broad beak and a bright red throat. Their eyes are fully open at around 10 days. Chicks develop fine downy feathers on their head, back and wings in the first week, and pinfeathers in the second week. The black and white colouration is noticeable from an early stage.[82] Nestlings are fed exclusively by the female, though the male magpie will feed his partner.[83] The Australian magpie is known to engage in cooperative breeding, and helper birds will assist in feeding and raising young.[41] This does vary from region to region, and with the size of the groupthe behaviour is rare or nonexistent in pairs or small groups.[41]
Juvenile magpies begin foraging on their own three weeks after leaving the nest, and mostly feeding themselves by six months old. Some birds continue begging for food until eight or nine months of age, but are usually ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year.[84] The age at which young birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males are usually evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years.[85]
The Australian magpie is omnivorous, eating various items located at or near ground level including invertebrates such as earthworms, millipedes, snails, spiders and scorpions as well as a wide variety of insectscockroaches, ants, beetles, cicadas, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. Insects, including large adult grasshoppers, may be seized mid-flight. Skinks, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs and walnuts have also been noted as components of their diet.[86] It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous cane toad by flipping it over and consuming the underparts.[87] Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae.[88] One study showed birds were able to find scarab beetle larvae by sound or vibration.[89] Birds use their bills to probe into the earth or otherwise overturn debris in search of food.[90] Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the stingers of bees and wasps before swallowing.[91]
Magpies are ubiquitous in urban areas all over Australia, and have become accustomed to people. A small percentage of birds become highly aggressive during breeding season from late August to early - mid October, and will swoop and sometimes attack passersby. The percentage has been difficult to estimate but is significantly less than 9%.[92] Almost all attacking birds (around 99%) are male,[93] and they are generally known to attack pedestrians at around 50?m (160?ft) from their nest, and cyclists at around 100?m (330?ft).[94] There appears to be some specificity in choice of attack targets, with the majority of individuals specializing on either pedestrians or cyclists.[95] Attacks begin as the eggs hatch, increase in frequency and severity as the chicks grow, and tail off as the chicks leave the nest.[96]
These magpies may engage in an escalating series of behaviours to drive off intruders. Least threatening are alarm calls and distant swoops, where birds fly within several metres from behind and perch nearby. Next in intensity are close swoops, where a magpie will swoop in from behind or the side and audibly &quot;snap&quot; their beaks or even peck or bite at the face, neck, ears or eyes. More rarely, a bird may dive-bomb and strike the intruder&#39;s (usually a cyclist&#39;s) head with its chest. A magpie may rarely attack by landing on the ground in front of a person and lurching up and landing on the victim&#39;s chest and pecking at the face and eyes.[97]
Magpie attacks can cause injuries, typically wounds to the head,[98] and being unexpectedly swooped while cycling can result in loss of control of the bicycle, which may cause injury.[99][100][101]
If it is necessary to walk near the nest, wearing a broad-brimmed or legionnaire&#39;s hat or using an umbrella will deter attacking birds, but beanies and bicycle helmets are of little value as birds attack the sides of the head and neck.[102]
Magpies prefer to swoop at the back of the head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight at all times can discourage the bird. A basic disguise such as sunglasses worn on the back of the head may fool the magpie as to where a person is looking. Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.[103]
Cyclists can deter attack by attaching a long pole with a flag to a bike,[104] and the use of cable ties on helmets has become common and appears to be effective.[105]
Magpies are a protected native species in Australia, so it is illegal to kill or harm them. However, this protection is removed in some Australian states if a magpie attacks a human, allowing for the bird to be destroyed if it is considered particularly aggressive (such a provision is made, for example, in section 54 of the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act).[106] More commonly, an aggressive bird will be caught and relocated to an unpopulated area.[107] Magpies have to be moved some distance as almost all are able to find their way home from distances of less than 25?km (16?mi).[108] Removing the nest is of no use as birds will breed again and possibly be more aggressive the second time around.[109]
Some claim that swooping can be prevented by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, will return to the same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.[110]
The Australian magpie featured in aboriginal folklore around Australia. The Yindjibarndi people of the Pilbara in the northwest of the country used the bird as a signal for sunrise, frightening them awake with its call. They were also familiar with its highly territorial nature, and it features in a song in their Burndud, or songs of customs.[14] It was a totem bird of the people of the Illawarra region south of Sydney.[111]
Under the name piping shrike, the white-backed magpie was declared the official emblem of the Government of South Australia in 1901 by Governor Tennyson,[112] and has featured on the South Australian flag since 1904.[113] The magpie is a commonly used emblem of sporting teams in Australia, and its brash, cocky attitude has been likened to the Australian psyche.[114] Such teams tend to wear uniforms with black and white stripes. The Collingwood Football Club adopted the magpie from a visiting South Australian representative team in 1892.[115] The Port Adelaide Magpies would similarly adopt the black and white colours and Magpie name in 1902.[116] Other examples include Brisbane&#39;s Souths Logan Magpies,[114] and Sydney&#39;s Western Suburbs Magpies. Disputes over who has been the first club to adopt the magpie emblem have been heated at times.[117] Another club, Glenorchy Football Club of Tasmania, was forced to change uniform design when placed in the same league as another club (Claremont Magpies) with the same emblem.[118]
In New Zealand, the Hawke&#39;s Bay Rugby Union team, from Napier, New Zealand, is also known as the magpies.[119] One of the best-known New Zealand poems is &quot;The Magpies&quot; by Denis Glover, with its refrain &quot;Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle&quot;, imitating the sound of the bird Ã¿ and the popular New Zealand comic Footrot Flats features a magpie character by the name of Pew.[120]
An online poll conducted by Guardian Australia and BirdLife Australia was held in late 2017 to choose the &quot;Australian Bird of the Year&quot;. The Australian magpie won the contest with 19,926 votes (13.3%), narrowly ahead of the Australian white ibis.[121]</div></div><div class="card" data-v-77bf5ffc><div class="question" data-v-77bf5ffc>Where did the phantom of the opera live?</div><div class="separator" data-v-77bf5ffc></div><div class="answer" data-v-77bf5ffc>the Palais Garnier opera houseðŸš¨The Phantom of the Opera (French: Le Fant?me de l&#39;Opra) is a novel by French writer Gaston Leroux. It was first published as a serialization in Le Gaulois from 23 September 1909, to 8 January 1910. It was published in volume form in late March 1910 by Pierre Lafitte.[1]  The novel is partly inspired by historical events at the Paris Opera during the nineteenth century and an apocryphal tale concerning the use of a former ballet pupil&#39;s skeleton in Carl Maria von Weber&#39;s 1841 production of Der Freischtz.[2]  It has been successfully adapted into various stage and film adaptations, most notable of which are the 1925 film depiction featuring Lon Chaney, and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#39;s 1986 musical.

Leroux first decided he would become a lawyer, but after he spent his inheritance gambling he became a reporter for LEcho de Paris. At the paper he was asked to write about and critique dramas, as well as being a courtroom reporter. With his job, he was able to travel frequently, but then he came back to Paris where he became a writer. Because of his fascination with both Edgar Allan Poe and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, he wrote a detective mystery entitled The Mystery of the Yellow Room in 1907, and four years later he published Le Fant?me de lOpra.[3] The novel was first published within newspapers before finally being published as a novel in 1911.[4]

The setting of The Phantom of the Opera came from an actual Paris opera house that Leroux had heard the rumors about from the time the opera house was finished. The details about the Palais Garnier, and rumors surrounding it, are closely linked in Leroux&#39;s writing.  The underground water tank that he had written about is accurate to this opera house, and it is still used for training firefighters. The mysteries that Leroux uses in his novel about the phantom are still mysteries. [5]

The Phantom of the Opera&#39;s origins came from Leroux&#39;s curiosity with the phantom being real. In the prologue he tells the readers about the phantom and the research that he did to prove the truth of the ghost. His findings connected the corpse from the opera house to the Persian phantom himself. [6] The claims from the prologue of his novel were ones that Leroux held onto even up until his death in 1927. [5]

In Paris in the 1880s, the Palais Garnier opera house is believed to be haunted by an entity known as the Phantom of the Opera, or simply the Opera Ghost. A stagehand named Joseph Buquet is found hanged and the rope around his neck goes missing.  At a gala performance for the retirement of the opera house&#39;s two managers, a young little-known Swedish soprano, Christine Daa, is called upon to sing in the place of the Opera&#39;s leading soprano, Carlotta, who is ill, and her performance is an astonishing success. The Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, who was present at the performance, recognizes her as his childhood playmate and recalls his love for her. He attempts to visit her backstage, where he hears a man complimenting her from inside her dressing room. He investigates the room once Christine leaves, only to find it empty.

At Perros-Guirec, Christine meets with Raoul, who confronts her about the voice he heard in her room. Christine tells him she has been tutored by the Angel of Music, whom her father used to tell them about. When Raoul  suggests that she might be the victim of a prank, she storms off. Christine visits her father&#39;s grave one night, where a mysterious figure appears and plays the violin for her. Raoul attempts to confront it but is attacked and knocked out in the process.

Back at the Palais Garnier, the new managers receive a letter from the Phantom demanding that they allow Christine to perform the lead role of Marguerite in Faust, and that box 5 be left empty for his use, lest they perform in a house with a curse on it. The managers ignore his demands as a prank, resulting in disastrous consequences: Carlotta ends up croaking like a toad, and the chandelier suddenly drops into the audience, killing a spectator. The Phantom, having abducted Christine from her dressing room, reveals himself as a deformed man called Erik.   Erik intends to keep her in his lair with him for a few days, but she causes him to change his plans when she unmasks him and, to the horror of both, beholds his noseless, lipless, sunken-eyed face, which resembles a skull dried up by the centuries, covered in yellowed dead flesh.

Fearing that she will leave him, he decides to keep her with him forever, but when Christine requests release after two weeks, he agrees on the condition that she wear his ring and be faithful to him. On the roof of the opera house, Christine tells Raoul about her abduction and makes Raoul promise to take her away to a place where Erik can never find her, even if she resists. Raoul tells Christine he will act on his promise the next day, to which she agrees. However, Christine sympathizes with Erik and decides to sing for him one last time as a means of saying goodbye. Unbeknownst to Christine and Raoul, Erik has been watching them and overheard their whole conversation.

The following night, the enraged and jealous Erik abducts Christine during a production of Faust and tries to force her to marry him. Raoul is led by a mysterious opera regular known as &quot;The Persian&quot; into Erik&#39;s secret lair deep in the bowels of the opera house, but they end up trapped in a mirrored room by Erik, who threatens that unless Christine agrees to marry him, he will kill them and everyone in the Opera House by using explosives.  Christine agrees to marry Erik. Erik initially tries to drown Raoul and the Persian, using the water which would have been used to douse the explosives, but Christine begs and offers to be his &quot;living bride&quot;, promising him not to kill herself after becoming his bride, as she had both contemplated and attempted earlier in the book. Erik eventually releases Raoul and the Persian from his torture chamber.

When Erik is alone with Christine, he lifts his mask to kiss her on her forehead and is given a kiss back. Erik reveals that he has never received a kiss, not even from his own mother, nor has been allowed to give one and is overcome with emotion. He and Christine then cry together and their tears &quot;mingle&quot;. Erik later says that he has never felt so close to another human being. He allows the Persian and Raoul to escape, though not before making Christine promise that she will visit him on his death day, and return the gold ring he gave her. He also makes the Persian promise that afterward he will go to the newspaper and report his death, as he will die soon and will die &quot;of love&quot;. Indeed, sometime later Christine returns to Erik&#39;s lair, buries him somewhere he will never be found (by Erik&#39;s request) and returns the gold ring. Afterward, a local newspaper runs the simple note: &quot;Erik is dead&quot;.  Christine and Raoul (who finds out that Erik has killed his older brother) elope together, never to return.

Passages narrated directly by the Persian and the final chapter piece together Erik&#39;s life: the son of a construction business owner deformed from birth, he ran away from his native Normandy to work in fairs and in caravans, schooling himself in the arts of the circus across Europe and Asia, and eventually building trick palaces in Persia and Turkey.  Eventually, he returned to France and, wearing a mask, started his own construction business.  After being subcontracted to work on the foundations of the Palais Garnier, Erik had discreetly built himself a lair to disappear in, complete with hidden passages and other tricks that allowed him to spy on the managers.

Leroux uses the operatic setting in The Phantom of the Opera to use music as a device for foreshadowing.[7] Ribire makes note that Leroux was once a theatre critic and his brother was a musician, so he was knowledgeable about music and how to use it as a framing device. She uses the example of how Leroux introduces the song Danse Macabre which means &quot;dance of death&quot; in the gala scene which foreshadows the graveyard scene that comes later where the Phantom plays the fiddle for Christine and attacks Raoul when he tries to intervene. 

Drumright points out that music is evident throughout the novel in that it is the basis for Christine and Erik&#39;s relationship. Christine sees Erik as her Angel of Music that her father promised would come to her one day. The Phantom sees Christine as his musical protege, and he uses his passion for music to teach her everything he knows.[4]

Stylistically, the novel is framed as a mystery novel as it is narrated through a detective pulling his information from various forms of research.[8] The mystery being uncovered is the Phantom who lurks through the opera house, seemingly appearing in places out of nowhere as if by magic.[9]

In his article, Fitzpatrick compares the Phantom to other monsters featured in Gothic horror novels such as Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, and Dracula. The Phantom has a torture chamber where he kidnaps and kills people, and the walls of the chapel in the graveyard are lined with human bones.[9] Indeed, Drumright notes that The Phantom of the Opera checks off every trope necessary to have a Gothic novel according to the Encyclopedia of Literature&#39;s description which says, Such novels were expected to be dark and tempestuous and full of ghosts, madness, outrage,
superstition, and revenge.[10] Although the Phantom is really just a disfigured man, he has ghost-like qualities in that no one can ever find him or his lair and he is seen as a monster. People are frightened by him because of his deformities and the  acts of violence he commits.[4]

The novel features a love triangle between the Phantom, Christine, and Raoul. Raoul is seen as Christine&#39;s childhood love whom she is familiar with and has affection for. He is rich and therefore offers her security as well as a wholesome, Christian marriage. The Phantom, on the other hand, is not familiar. He is dark, ugly, and dangerous and therefore represents the forbidden love. However, Christine is drawn to him because she sees him as her Angel of Music, and she pities his existence of loneliness and darkness.[4]

By the time Leroux published The Phantom of the Opera, he had already gained credibility as a crime mystery author in both French and English speaking countries. He had written six novels prior, two of which had garnered substantial popularity within their first year of publication called The Mystery of the Yellow Room and The Perfume of the Lady in Black.[7] Although previous commentators have asserted that The Phantom of the Opera did not attain as much success as these previous novels, being particularly unpopular in France where it was first published,[11] recent research into the novel&#39;s early reception and sales has indicated the contrary.[12] One book review from the New York Times expressed a disappointment in the way the phantom was portrayed, saying that the feeling of suspense and horror is lost once it is found out that the phantom is just a man and not a real ghost.[13]The majority of the notability that the novel acquired early on was due to its publication in a series of installments in French, American, and English newspapers. This serialized version of the story became important when it was read and sought out by Universal Pictures to be adapted into a movie in 1925.[11]

Based on the critical reviews of two modern day readers of the book, Sean Fitzpatrick and Cathleen Myers, the novel is praiseworthy for its drama, but overall it does not rise to the standards of great literature. Fitzpatrick claims that &quot;The Phantom of the Opera is not a great book, but it is a great read.&quot;[9] He digresses that even though the book is not good enough to be in the canon of great literature, there are many aspects of it that make it fun to read such as the drama of the &quot;whodunnit&quot; plot, the investigative styling of the book which pretends to pull from real life newspaper articles and interviews relating to the Paris Opera House, and the character Erik (the phantom) who fills the roles of the &quot;mad genius&quot;, disfigured monster, and one of three in a love triangle all at once. Fitzpatrick argues that all of these elements make the book good for light reading.[9] Myers agrees that the novel makes for a good &quot;airplane read&quot;, but says that it fails in terms of being a good mystery novel. She claims that one of the book&#39;s downfalls is that one of the important characters - the mysterious Persian - is introduced too late in the storyline. Another glaring omission that she sees in the book is that the Phantom is left unexplained. Myers also criticizes Christine&#39;s love for Raoul whom she claims is an idiot, saying he &quot;makes Jonathon Harker and Lord Godalming in Dracula look like rocket scientists.&quot;[8]

There have been many literary and other dramatic works based on Leroux&#39;s novel, ranging from stage musicals to films to children&#39;s books. Some well known stage and screen adaptations of the novel are the 1925 film and the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. In Webber&#39;s musical, he was focused on writing more of a romance piece and found the book and the musical took off from there. Leroux&#39;s novel was more than just a mystery and had romance and other genres, that would appeal to more audiences. [14] Webber used accounts from within the novel in the musical as well such as the real-life event of the chandelier falling. [15] This musical even after being produced in the mid-80s, has still remained popular with people today. The musical has received more than fifty awards and is seen by many as being the most popular musical on Broadway. [14]

Lerouxs novel was created into two silent films during the history and adaptations of the novel. The first production of the novel into a silent film was produced by German adaptation called, Das Gespenst im Opernhaus. This film though has no living proof left and is lost due to no pictures being taken or an actual copy of the film is preserved. The last living knowledge of the film is that it was made in 1916 and was directed by Ernest Matray. [16]

The next adaptation or silent film was made in 1925 by Universal Studios. This version starred Lon Chaney Sr. as the phantom. Due to tensions on the set, there was a switch in directors and Edward Sedgwick finished the film while changing the direction the movie was going to take. His take on the novel and making it a dark romantic movie with comedy wasnt popular by audiences. [16]Finally, the film was adapted one last time by Maurice Pivar and Louis Weber where they took out most of Sedgwicks adaptation and stuck to the original film. This time, the movie was a success with audiences in 1925.

The United States Air Force Academy (also known as USAFA, the Air Force Academy, or the Academy), is a military academy for officer cadets of the United States Air Force. Its campus is located in the western United States in Colorado, immediately north of Colorado Springs in El Paso County.
The Academy&#39;s stated mission is &quot;to educate, train, and inspire men and women to become leaders of character, motivated to lead the United States Air Force in service to our nation.&quot;[7] It is the youngest of the five U.S. service academies, having graduated its first class 59 years ago in 1959, however it is the third in seniority.[8] Graduates of the Academy&#39;s four-year program receive a Bachelor of Science degree, and are commissioned as second lieutenants in the U.S. Air Force.[9] The Academy is also one of the largest tourist attractions in Colorado, attracting approximately a million visitors each year.[7]
Admission is extremely competitive, with nominations divided equally among Congressional districts. Recent incoming classes have had about 1,200 cadets; historically, just under 1,000 of those will graduate.[10] Tuition along with room and board are all paid for by the Air Force. Cadets receive a monthly stipend, but incur a commitment to serve a number of years of military service after graduation.[11]
The program at the Academy is guided by the Air Force&#39;s core values of &quot;Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do&quot;,[7] and based on four &quot;pillars of excellence&quot;: military training, academics, athletics and character development.[7] In addition to a rigorous military training regimen, cadets also take a broad academic course load with an extensive core curriculum in engineering, humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, military studies and physical education. All cadets participate in either intercollegiate or intramural athletics, and a thorough character development and leadership curriculum provides cadets a basis for future officership. Each of the components of the program is intended to give cadets the skills and knowledge that they will need for success as officers.


Prior to the Academy&#39;s establishment, air power advocates had been pushing for a separate Air Force Academy for decades. As early as 1918, Lieutenant Colonel A.J. Hanlon wrote, &quot;As the Military and Naval Academies are the backbone of the Army and Navy, so must the Aeronautical Academy be the backbone of the Air Service. No service can flourish without some such institution to inculcate into its embryonic officers love of country, proper conception of duty, and highest regard for honor.&quot;[12] Other officials expressed similar sentiments. In 1919, Congressman Charles F. Curry introduced legislation providing for an Academy, but concerns about cost, curriculum and location led to its demise.[12] In 1925, air power pioneer General Billy Mitchell testified on Capitol Hill that it was necessary &quot;to have an air academy to form a basis for the permanent backbone of your air service and to attend to the...organizational part of it, very much the same way that West Point does for the Army, or that Annapolis does for the Navy.&quot;[12][13] Mitchell&#39;s arguments did not gain traction with legislators, and it was not until the late 1940s that the concept of the United States Air Force Academy began to take shape.[12]
Support for an air academy got a boost with the National Security Act of 1947, which provided for the establishment of a separate Air Force within the United States military. As an initial measure, Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington negotiated an agreement where up to 25% of West Point and Annapolis graduates could volunteer to receive their commissions in the newly established Air Force. This was only intended to be a short term fix, however, and disagreements between the services quickly led to the establishment of the Service Academy Board by Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. In January 1950, the Service Academy Board, headed by Dwight D. Eisenhower, then president of Columbia University, concluded that the needs of the Air Force could not be met by the two existing U.S. service academies and that an air force academy should be established.[12]
Following the recommendation of the Board, Congress passed legislation in 1954 to begin the construction of the Air Force Academy, and President Eisenhower signed it into law on 1 April of that year.[14] The legislation established an advisory commission to determine the site of the new school. Among the panel members were Charles Lindbergh, General Carl Spaatz, and Lieutenant General Hubert R. Harmon, who later became the Academy&#39;s first superintendent. The original 582 sites considered were winnowed to three: Alton, Illinois; Lake Geneva, Wisconsin; and the ultimate site at Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Secretary of the Air Force, Harold E. Talbott, announced the winning site on 24 June 1954.[15][16] Meanwhile, Air Training Command (ATC) began developing a detailed curriculum for the Academy program.[12]
The early Air Force Academy leadership had the model of West Point and Annapolis in designing an appropriate curriculum, faculty, and campus. The Academy&#39;s permanent site had not yet been completed when the first class entered, so the 306?cadets from the Class of 1959 were sworn in at a temporary site at Lowry Air Force Base in Denver on 11 July 1955.[17] While at Lowry, they were housed in renovated World War II barracks.[18] There were no upper class cadets to train the new cadets, so the Air Force appointed a cadre of &quot;Air Training Officers&quot; (ATOs) to conduct training. The ATOs were junior officers, many of whom were graduates of West Point, Annapolis, and The Citadel. They acted as surrogate upper class cadets until the upper classes could be populated over the next several years.[12] The Academy&#39;s dedication ceremony took place on that first day and was broadcast live on national television, with Walter Cronkite covering the event.[12] Arnold W. Braswell, a native of Minden, Louisiana, was commander of the original four cadet squadrons at the academy 1955 to 1958.[19]
In developing a distinctive uniform for cadets, the Air Force turned to Hollywood. Famed director Cecil B. DeMille designed the cadet parade uniform; it is still worn by cadets today.[citation needed]
The Class of 1959 established many other important traditions that continue until the present. The first class adopted the Cadet Honor Code, and chose the falcon as the Academy&#39;s mascot. On 29 August 1958, the wing of 1,145 cadets moved to the present site near Colorado Springs,[20] and less than a year later the Academy received accreditation. The first USAFA class graduated and was commissioned on 3 June 1959.[8][21]
The Vietnam War was the first war in which Academy graduates fought and died. As such, it had a profound effect on the development of the character of the Academy. Due to the need for more pilots, Academy enrollment grew significantly during this time. The size of the graduating classes went from 217 cadets in 1961 to 745 cadets in 1970.[22] Academy facilities were likewise expanded, and training was modified to better meet the needs of the wartime Air Force. The Jacks Valley field training area was added, the Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) program was expanded, and light aircraft training started in 1968.[22]
Many Academy graduates of this era served with distinction in the Vietnam War. F-4 Phantom II pilot Steve Ritchie &#39;64 and weapon systems officer Jeffrey Feinstein &#39;68 each became aces by downing five enemy aircraft in combat.[23][24] One hundred forty-one graduates died in the conflict; thirty-two graduates became prisoners of war. Lance Sijan, &#39;65, fell into both categories and became the first Academy graduate to be awarded the Medal of Honor due to his heroism while evading capture and in captivity.[25] Sijan Hall, one of the cadet dormitories, is named in his memory.
The effects of the anti-war movement were felt at the Academy as well. Because the Academy grounds are generally open to the public, the Academy often became a site for protests by anti-war demonstrators.[22] Regular demonstrations were held at the Cadet Chapel, and cadets often became the targets of protesters&#39; insults. Other aggravating factors were the presence in the Cadet Wing of cadets motivated to attend the Academy for reasons of draft avoidance, and a number of highly publicized cheating scandals. Morale sometimes suffered as a consequence.[citation needed]
One of the most significant events in the history of the Academy was the admission of women.[26][27] On 7?October 1975, President Gerald R. Ford signed legislation permitting women to enter the United States service academies. On 26 June 1976, 157 women entered the Air Force Academy with the Class of 1980. Because there were no female upper class cadets, the Air Training Officer model used in the early years of the Academy was revived, and fifteen young female officers were brought in to help with the integration process. The female cadets were initially segregated from the rest of the Cadet Wing but were fully integrated into their assigned squadrons after their first semester. On 28?May 1980, 97 of the original female cadets completed the program and graduated from the Academyjust over 10% of the graduating class. Women have made up just over 20% of the most recent classes, with the class of 2016 having the highest proportion of any class, 25%.[10]
Many of the women from those early classes went on to achieve success within the Cadet Wing and after graduation (see list of Academy graduates below). Despite these successes, integration issues were long apparent. Female cadets have had consistently higher dropout rates than men and have left the Air Force in higher numbers than men.[28]
Initial proposals for the Air Force Academy location were between Prescott, Arizona; Linn, Wisconsin; Alton, Illinois and Colorado Springs, Colorado. The selection committee cut the final list to only Alton, Linn and Colorado Springs. Final selection was awarded to Colorado Springs.[29]
The campus of the Academy covers 18,500 acres (29?sq?mi; 75?km2) on the east side of the Rampart Range of the Rocky Mountains, just north of Colorado Springs. Its elevation is normally given as 7,258 feet (2,212?m) above sea level, which is at the cadet area. The Academy was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) and lead architect Walter Netsch. SOM partner John O. Merrill moved from Chicago to a Colorado Springs field office to oversee the construction and to act as a spokesman for the project.[30]
The most controversial aspect of the SOM-designed Air Force Academy was its chapel.[31] It was designed by SOM architect Walter Netsch, who at one point was prepared to abandon the design;[32] but the accordion-like structure is acknowledged as an iconic symbol of the academy campus.
The buildings in the Cadet Area were designed in a distinct, modernist style, and make extensive use of aluminum on building exteriors, suggesting the outer skin of aircraft or spacecraft.[33] On 1 April 2004, fifty years after Congress authorized the building of the Academy, the Cadet Area at the Academy was designated a National Historic Landmark.[34][35]
The main buildings in the Cadet Area are set around a large, square pavilion known as &quot;the Terrazzo,&quot; and the most recognizable is the 17-spired Cadet Chapel.[36] The subject of controversy when it was first built, it is now considered among the most prominent examples of modern American academic architecture. Other buildings on the Terrazzo include Vandenberg Hall and Sijan Hall, the two dormitories; Mitchell Hall, the cadet dining facility; and Fairchild Hall, the main academic building, which houses academic classrooms, laboratories, research facilities, faculty offices and the Robert F. McDermott Library.
The Aeronautics Research Center (also known as the &quot;Aero Lab&quot;) contains numerous aeronautical research facilities, including transonic, subsonic, low speed, and cascade wind tunnels; engine and rocket test cells; and simulators.[37] The Consolidated Education and Training Facility (CETF) was built in 1997 as an annex to Fairchild Hall. It contains chemistry and biology classrooms and labs, medical and dental clinics, and civil engineering and astronautics laboratories. The Cadet Area also contains an observatory and a planetarium for academic use and navigation training.
The cadet social center is Arnold Hall, located just outside the Cadet Area, which houses a 3000-seat theater, a ballroom, a number of lounges, and dining and recreation facilities for cadets and visitors. Harmon Hall is the primary administration building, which houses the offices of the Superintendent and the Superintendent&#39;s staff.
The Cadet Area also contains extensive facilities for use by cadets participating in intercollegiate athletics, intramural athletics, physical education classes and other physical training. Set amid numerous outdoor athletic fields are the Cadet Gymnasium and the Cadet Fieldhouse. The Fieldhouse is the home to Clune Arena, the ice hockey rink and an indoor track, which doubles as an indoor practice facility for a number of sports. Falcon Stadium, located outside of the Cadet Area, is the football field and site of the graduation ceremonies.[7]
Many displays around the Cadet Area commemorate heroes and air power pioneers, and serve as an inspiration to cadets. The War Memorial, a black marble wall located just under the flagpole on the Terrazzo, is etched with the names of Academy graduates who have been killed in combat. The Honor Wall, overlooking the Terrazzo, is inscribed with the Cadet Honor Code: &quot;We will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.&quot; Just under the Cadet Chapel, the Class Wall bears the crests of each of the Academy&#39;s graduating classes. The crest of the current first (senior) class is displayed in the center position. Another display often used as a symbol of the Academy, the Eagle and Fledglings Statue was given as a gift to the Academy in 1958 by the personnel of Air Training Command. It contains the inscription by Austin Dusty Miller, &quot;Man&#39;s flight through life is sustained by the power of his knowledge.&quot; Static air- and spacecraft displays on the Academy grounds include an F-4, F-15, F-16 and F-105 on the Terrazzo; a B-52 by the North Gate; a T-38 and A-10 at the airfield; an F-100 by the preparatory school; a SV-5J lifting body next to the aeronautics laboratory; and a Minuteman III missile in front of the Fieldhouse. The Minuteman III was removed 9 years ago in August 2008 due to rusting and other internal damage.[citation needed]
The &quot;Core Values Ramp&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Bring Me Men Ramp&quot;) leads down from the main Terrazzo level toward the parade field. On in-processing day, new cadets arrive at the base of the ramp and start their transition into military and Academy life by ascending the ramp to the Terrazzo. From 1964 to 2004, the portal at the base of the ramp was inscribed with the words &quot;Bring me men... &quot; taken from the poem, &quot;The Coming American,&quot; by Samuel Walter Foss. In a controversial move following the 2003 sexual assault scandal, the words &quot;Bring me men...&quot; were taken down and replaced with the Academy&#39;s (later adopted as the Air Force&#39;s) core values: &quot;Integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do.&quot;[7]
With an enrollment of over 1300, Air Academy High School is the only high school in the United States built on a military academy. It ranks in the top ten in the state in academic standards. Part of School District 20 (D20), its marching band regularly places in the top ten in state championships. D20 also maintains an elementary school on the academy grounds.
Other locations on campus serve support roles for cadet training and other base functions. Doolittle Hall is the headquarters of the Academy&#39;s Association of Graduates and also serves as the initial reception point for new cadets arriving for Basic Cadet Training. It is named after General Jimmy Doolittle. The Goldwater Visitor Center, named after longtime proponent of the Academy United States Senator Barry Goldwater, is the focal point for family, friends and tourists visiting the Academy grounds. The Academy Airfield is used for training cadets in airmanship courses, including parachute training, soaring and powered flight. Interment at the Academy Cemetery is limited to Academy cadets and graduates, certain senior officers, certain Academy staff members, and certain other family members. Air power notables Carl Spaatz, Curtis E. LeMay and Robin Olds, are interred here.[citation needed]
The United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School (usually referred to as the &quot;Prep School&quot;) is a program offered to selected individuals who were not able to obtain appointments directly to the Academy. The program involves intense academic preparation (particularly in English, math and science), along with athletic and military training, meant to prepare the students for appointment to the Academy. A high percentage of USAFA Preparatory School students (known as &quot;Preppies&quot;) earn appointments to the Academy following their year at the Prep School.[citation needed]
The Cadet Honor Code is the cornerstone of a cadet&#39;s professional training and development Ã¿ the minimum standard of ethical conduct that cadets expect of themselves and their fellow cadets. The Honor Code was developed and adopted by the Class of 1959, the first class to graduate from the Academy and has been handed down to every subsequent class.[38][39] The Code itself is simple:
In 1984, the Cadet Wing voted to add an &quot;Honor Oath,&quot; which was to be taken by all cadets. The oath is administered to fourth class cadets (freshmen) when they are formally accepted into the Wing at the conclusion of Basic Cadet Training.[39] The oath remains unchanged since its adoption in 1984 and consists of a statement of the code, followed by a resolution to live honorably (the phrase &quot;So help me God&quot; is now optional):
We will not lie, steal or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does. Furthermore, I resolve to do my duty and to live honorably, (so help me God).
Cadets are considered the &quot;guardians and stewards&quot; of the Code. Cadet honor representatives are chosen by senior leadership, and oversee the honor system by conducting education classes and investigating suspected honor violations. Cadets throughout the Wing are expected to sit on Honor Boards as juries that determine whether their fellow cadets violated the code. Cadets also recommend sanctions for violations. The presumed sanction for an honor violation is disenrollment, but mitigating factors may result in the violator being placed in a probationary status for some period of time. This &quot;honor probation&quot; is usually only reserved for cadets in their first two years at the Academy.[citation needed]
To reinforce the importance of honor, character and integrity to future officers, cadets are given an extensive character and leadership curriculum. The Academy&#39;s Center for Character and Leadership Development provides classroom, seminar, workshop and experiential-based learning programs to all cadets, beginning when they enter Basic Cadet Training and continuing each year through their last semester at the Academy. The Center&#39;s programs, when coupled with the Honor Code and Honor System, establish a foundation for the &quot;leaders of character&quot; that the Academy aspires to produce.[40]
The Academy&#39;s organization is unusual in a number of respects. Because it is primarily a military unit, much of the Academy&#39;s structure is set up like that of any other Air Force Base. This is particularly true of the non-cadet unitsmost assigned to the 10th Air Base Wingthat provide base services such as security, communications, and engineering. Because the Academy is also a university, however, the organization of the faculty and the Cadet Wing have some aspects that are more similar to the faculty and student body at a civilian college.
The student body of the Academy is known as the Cadet Wing. The students, called &quot;cadets&quot;, are divided into four classes, based on their year in school, much like a civilian college. They are not referred to as freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors, however, but as fourth-, third-, second- and first class cadets, respectively. Fourth class cadets (freshmen) are often referred to as &quot;doolies,&quot; a term derived from the Greek word Ñ´?? (&quot;doulos&quot;) meaning &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;servant.&quot;[41] Members of the three lower classes are also referred to as &quot;4 degrees,&quot; &quot;3 degrees&quot; or &quot;2 degrees&quot; based on their class.[42] First-class cadets (seniors) are referred to as &quot;firsties.&quot; In the military structure of the Cadet Wing, first class cadets hold the positions of cadet officers, second class cadets act as the cadet non-commissioned officers and third class cadets represent the cadet junior non-commissioned officers.[citation needed]
The Cadet Wing is divided into four groups, of ten cadet squadrons each. Each cadet squadron consists of about 110 cadets, roughly evenly distributed among the four classes. Selected first-, second- and third-class cadets hold leadership, operational and support jobs at the squadron, group and wing levels. Cadets live, march and eat meals with members of their squadrons. Military training and intramural athletics are conducted by squadron as well. Each cadet squadron and cadet group is supervised by a specially selected active duty officer called an Air Officer Commanding (AOC). In the case of a cadet squadron, the AOC is normally an active duty Air Force major. For a cadet group, the AOC is normally an active-duty lieutenant colonel. These officers have command authority over the cadets, counsel cadets on leadership and military career issues, oversee military training and serve as role models for the future officers.[citation needed] In addition to an AOC, cadet squadrons and groups are also supervised by an active duty non-commissioned officer known as an Academy Military Trainer (AMT), who fulfills a similar job as the AOC.
The Superintendent of the Academy is the commander and senior officer. The position of Superintendent is normally held by an active-duty lieutenant general. The superintendent&#39;s role is roughly similar to that of the president of a civilian university. As such, the Superintendent oversees all aspects of the Academy, including military training, academics, athletics, admissions and also functions as the installation commander of the Academy Reservation. The Academy is a Direct Reporting Unit within the Air Force, so the Superintendent reports directly to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force.[43]
Those reporting to the Superintendent include the Dean of the Faculty and Commandant of Cadets, each of whom typically holds the rank of brigadier general, as well as the Director of Athletics, the Commander of the 10th Air Base Wing and the Commander of the Prep School, each of whom typically holds the rank of colonel. The 10th Air Base Wing provides all base support functions that exist at other air force bases, including civil engineering, communications, medical support, personnel, administration, security and base services. The Preparatory School provides an academic, athletic and military program for qualified young men and women who may need certain additional preparation prior to acceptance to the Academy. All flying programs at the Academy are run by the 306th Flying Training Group, which reports to the Air Education and Training Command, ensuring uniformity of flight training with the rest of the Air Force.[citation needed]
Congressional oversight of the Academy is exercised through a Board of Visitors (BOV), established under Title 10, United States Code, Section 9355. The board inquires into the morale, discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods and other matters relating to the Academy. The board meets at least four times per year and prepares semi-annual reports containing its views and recommendations submitted concurrently to the Secretary of Defense, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the House Armed Services Committee. The 15 members of the BOV are variously appointed by the President of the United States, the Vice President, the Senate and House Armed Services Committees and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Since 2006, the board has been required to include at least two Academy graduates. In July 2009, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Colorado Congressman Jared Polis to the BOV, the first openly gay person to serve on a service academys advisory board.[44]
Cadets&#39; military training occurs throughout their time at the Academy, but is especially intense during their four summers. The first military experience for new cadets (called &quot;basic cadets&quot;) occurs during the six weeks of Basic Cadet Training (BCT), in the summer before their fourth class (freshman) year. During BCT, also known as &quot;beast,&quot; cadets learn the fundamentals of military and Academy life under the leadership of a cadre of first and second class cadets.[45] Basic cadets learn military customs and courtesies, proper wear of the uniform, drill and ceremony, and study military knowledge and undergo a rigorous physical training program. During the second half of BCT, basic cadets march to Jacks Valley, where they complete the program in a field encampment environment. Upon completion of BCT, basic cadets receive their fourth-class shoulder boards, take the Honor Oath and are formally accepted as members of the Cadet Wing.[46]
The fourth-class (freshman) year is traditionally the most difficult at the Academy, militarily. In addition to their full academic course loads, heavy demands are placed on fourth class cadets outside of class. Fourth class cadets are expected to learn an extensive amount of military and Academy-related knowledge and have significant restrictions placed on their movement and actionstraversing the Cadet Area only by approved routes (including staying on the marble &quot;strips&quot; on the Terrazzo) and interacting with upper class cadets using a very specific decorum. The fourth class year ends with &quot;Recognition,&quot; a physically and mentally demanding several-day event which culminates in the award of the Prop and Wings insignia to the fourth class cadets, signifying their ascension to the ranks of upper class cadets. After Recognition, the stringent rules of the fourth class year are relaxed.[citation needed]
After the first year, cadets have more options for summer military training. Between their fourth and third class years, cadets undergo training in Air Force operations in a deployed environment (called Expeditionary Skills and Evasion Training [ESET]) and may participate in flying gliders, cyber-warfare training, satellite and space operations, unmanned systems, or free-fall parachute training. From the late 1960s until the mid-1990s, cadets also completed SERE training in the Jacks Valley complex between their fourth- and third-class years. This program was replaced with Combat Survival Training (CST) in 1995 and done away with entirely in 2005. In the summer of 2008, the CST program was reintroduced, but was cut again in 2011 and replaced with ESET for the summer of 2012 (the Class of 2015 was the first to participate in ESET). During their last two summers, cadets may serve as BCT cadre, travel to active duty Air Force bases and participate in a variety of other research, aviation and leadership programs. They may also be able to take courses offered by other military services, such as the U.S. Army&#39;s Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia, or the Air Assault School, at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. During the academic year, all cadets take formal classes in military theory, operations and leadership.
The Air Force Academy is an accredited four-year university offering bachelor&#39;s degrees in a variety of subjects. Active-duty Air Force officers make up approximately 70 percent of the faculty, with the balance long-term civilian professors, visiting professors from civilian universities and instructors from other U.S. and allied foreign military services. In recent years, civilians have become a growing portion of senior faculty.
Every Dean of the Faculty (equivalent to a Provost at most universities) has always been an active-duty brigadier general, although technically, a civilian may hold the position. The Dean, the Vice Dean, and each academic department chair hold the academic rank of Permanent Professor. Permanent Professors are nominated by the President of the United States and approved by the Senate, and can serve until age 64.
All graduates receive a Bachelor of Science degree, regardless of major, because of the technical content of the core requirements. Cadets may choose from a variety of majors, including engineering, the basic sciences, social sciences and humanities, as well as in a variety of divisional or inter-disciplinary subjects. The academic program has an extensive core curriculum, in which all cadets take required courses in the sciences, engineering, social sciences, humanities, military studies and physical education. Approximately sixty percent of a cadet&#39;s course load is mandated by the core curriculum. As a result, most of a cadet&#39;s first two years are spent in core classes. While core requirements remain significant during the third and fourth years, cadets have more flexibility to focus in their major areas of study, allowing them to participate in international and inter-service Academy exchange programs.
Traditionally, the academic program at the Air Force Academy (as with military academies in general) has focused heavily on science and engineering, with the idea that many graduates would be expected to manage complex air, space and information technology systems. As a result, the Academy&#39;s engineering programs have traditionally been ranked highly. Over time, however, the Academy broadened its humanities offerings. About 55% of cadets typically select majors in non-technical disciplines.[citation needed] The academy&#39;s recent implementation of a computer and network security program may represent a return to form.[47]
Externally funded research at the Air Force Academy has been a large and growing part of the technical majors. Air Force has ranked highest of all undergraduate-only universities in federally funded research as reported by the National Science Foundation, surpassing $60 million in 2010.[citation needed] Many cadets are involved in research via their major, coordinated in more than a dozen Academy research centers, including the Institute for Information Technology Applications, the Institute for National Security Studies, the Air Force Humanities Institute, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Studies, the Life Sciences Research Center, the Academy Center for Physics Education Research, among others.
All cadets at the Academy take part in the school&#39;s extensive athletic program. The program is designed to enhance the physical conditioning of all cadets, to develop the physical skills necessary for officership, to teach leadership in a competitive environment and to build character.[48] The primary elements of the athletic program are intercollegiate athletics, intramural athletics, physical education, and the physical fitness tests.
Cadets are required to take physical education courses in each of their four years at the Academy. The classes cover a wide range of activities: Swimming and water survival build confidence while teaching important survival skills. Combative sports such as boxing, wrestling, judo and unarmed combat build confidence, teach controlled aggression and develop physical fitness. Cadets also take classes in team sports such as basketball and soccer, in lifetime sports such as tennis and golf and on the physiology of exercise.[citation needed]
Each semester, cadets must pass two athletic fitness tests: a 1.5?mi (2.4?km) run to measure aerobic fitness, and a 15-minute, 5-event, physical fitness test consisting of pull-ups, a standing long jump, sit-ups, push-ups and a 600?yd (550?m) sprint.[49] Failure to pass a fitness test usually results in the cadet being assigned to reconditioning until he can pass the test. Repeated failures can lead to disenrollment.[citation needed]
All cadets are required to compete in intramural athletics for their entire time at the Academy, unless they are on-season for intercollegiate athletics. Intramural sports put cadet squadrons against one another in many sports, including basketball, cross-country, flag football, ice hockey, racquetball, flickerball, rugby union, boxing, soccer, mountain biking, softball, team handball, tennis, Ultimate, wallyball and volleyball. Winning the Wing Championship in a given sport is a particular source of pride for a cadet squadron.[citation needed]
The Academy&#39;s intercollegiate program has 17 men&#39;s and 10 women&#39;s NCAA sanctioned teams, nicknamed the Falcons.[48] Men&#39;s teams compete in football, baseball, basketball, ice hockey, cross-country, fencing, golf, gymnastics, indoor and outdoor track, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, water polo and wrestling. Women&#39;s teams include basketball, cross-country, fencing, gymnastics, indoor and outdoor track, swimming and diving, soccer, tennis and volleyball. The Academy fields a coeducational team in rifle. In addition, the Academy also sponsors two non-NCAA programs: cheerleading and boxing. The Academy also has several club sports, such as rugby, that compete intercollegiately.[citation needed]
The men&#39;s and women&#39;s programs compete in NCAA&#39;s Division I, with the football team competing in Division I FBS. Most teams are in the Mountain West Conference; however, the wrestling team competes in the Big 12 Conference, the gymnastics teams compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation; the men&#39;s soccer team competes in the Western Athletic Conference;[50] the men&#39;s hockey team competes in Atlantic Hockey, the water polo team competes in the Western Water Polo Association, the coeducational rifle team competes in the Patriot Rifle Conference, and the men&#39;s lacrosse team competes in the Southern Conference. The men&#39;s boxing team competes in the National Collegiate Boxing Association. For a number of years, only the men&#39;s teams competed in Division I. Women&#39;s teams competed in Division II and were once members of the Continental Divide Conference, then the Colorado Athletic Conference. With new NCAA legislation, beginning in 1996, women&#39;s teams also competed in Division I.[citation needed]
Air Force has traditional service academy rivalries with Navy and Army. The three service academies compete for the Commander-in-Chief&#39;s Trophy in football each year. Air Force Falcons football has had the best showing of the three, winning the trophy 18 of its 34 years. The Academy also has an in-state rivalry with Colorado State University, which is located in Fort Collins and is a fellow member of the Mountain West Conference. [51][citation needed]
The boxing team, led for 31 years by Coach Ed Weichers, has won 18 national championships.[52] The Academy&#39;s men&#39;s and women&#39;s rugby teams have each won multiple national championships and the women&#39;s side recently had two players selected for the United States national team.[53] The football team has played in 17 bowl games and the basketball team has had strong showings in the last several years, qualifying for the NCAA tournament and, most recently, making the final four of the 2007 NIT Tournament.[54] The men&#39;s ice hockey team won the last two Atlantic Hockey conference tournaments, made the first ever appearance by a service academy in the NCAA hockey tournament in 2007, and made a repeat appearance in 2008. The Air Force Academy&#39;s Men&#39;s Hockey team recently lost in the &quot;Elite Eight&quot; of hockey in double overtime. This marked the farthest they had gone in the post-season in school history and the longest an Atlantic Hockey Association team has made it into the post-season.[55]
In 2014, Academy Superintendent Lt. Gen. Michelle Johnson responded to reports of allegations of sexual assault and drug use at a December 2011 party by calling for a review of the Athletic Department by the Inspector General.[56]
Cadets have the opportunity to take part in several airmanship activities to include soaring, parachuting, and powered flight. Airmanship activities at the Academy are primarily conducted by the 306th Flying Training Group.
The 94th Flying Training Squadron trains cadets in basic airmanship principles through several flights in TG-16A sailplanes. Each year, several soaring students are selected to become instructor pilots to teach new classes of soaring students. Some of these cadet instructor pilots also compete on the Soaring Racing Team or Acrobatics Team in national competitions.
Cadets also have the opportunity to take a parachuting course conducted by the 98th Flying Training Squadron. Each year, hundreds of cadets earn their Basic Parachutist Badge by completing five jumps in the program. A number of cadets are selected for further training and become members of The Wings of Blue, the U.S. Air Force Parachute Team.
A powered flight program is conducted under the 557th Flying Training Squadron to expose cadets to the basics of powered flight. The program uses T-53A aircraft to offer cadets basic flight training and the opportunity to solo. The U.S. Air Force Academy Flying Team is composed of ~26 cadets selected to compete in National Intercollegiate Flying Association competitions. The Flying Team uses T-41D and T-51A aircraft to compete in precision landing, navigation, and message drop events.
To be eligible to enter the Academy, a candidate must:[57][58]
In addition to the normal application process, all candidates must secure a nomination to the Academy, normally from a U.S. Senator or U.S. Representative. Each member of Congress and the Vice President can have five appointees attending the Air Force Academy at any time. The process for obtaining a congressional nomination is not political and candidates do not have to know their senator or representative to secure a nomination. Additional nomination slots are available for children of career military personnel, children of disabled veterans or veterans who were killed in action, or children of Medal of Honor recipients. The admissions process is a lengthy one and applicants usually begin the paperwork during their junior year of high school.[60]
There were 306 cadets admitted for the first class (class of 1959).[12] By 1961, class size was down to 271, but due to the need for officers in the Vietnam War, grew to 745 admittees in 1970,[22] and peaking in 1974, with 1,620, and 1975, with 1,626, the largest number ever admitted.[61] After that class sizes shrank down to about 1,300.[62][63] Despite a peak of 1,350 (admitted 2004) and 1,418 (admitted 2005), from 1995 to 2005 class size averaged about 1,250 freshmen.[61] From 2005 to 2010 class sizes were slightly down from the 2005 peak. The 2013 class (beginning 2009) had 1,286[64] and the 2014 class (beginning Fall 2010) had 1,285.[65] Cutbacks were ordered in 2011, so by 2012, the entering class (class of 2016) was down to about 1,050.[65] The current class (class of 2019) began with 1,248 students.
The Prop and Wings insignia of the Air Service (1918Ã¿26), Air Corps (1926Ã¿41), and Army Air Forces (1941Ã¿47) became the insignia of upperclass cadets at the Air Force Academy beginning with the first class, 1959. The insignia is given to fourth class (freshmen) cadets at the Recognition Ceremony near the end of their first year rite of passage. The standard insignia uses the design of the Air Corps Prop and Wings, except that it is all silver instead of the gold wings and silver prop of the earlier design. Cadets who have ancestors who served in the Air Service, Air Corps, or Army Air Forces, or those who are direct descendants of Air Force Academy graduates, are eligible to wear a silver prop and gold wings set of prop and wings.
The Air Force Academy cadet sabre is carried by first class (senior) cadets in command positions in the Cadet Wing. All graduates are normally entitled to own no more than two sabres: one for personal use and one to be given as a gift. The Plaque and Sabre Award is the highest award given by the Cadet Wing to dignitaries and other honorees.
The American college tradition of the class ring began with the class of 1835 at the U.S. Military Academy. From there, it spread to the U.S. Naval Academy in the class of 1869.[66] The Air Force Academy continued the tradition, beginning with the first class, 1959, and so is the only service academy to have had class rings for every class since its founding. The Air Force ring is distinctive for being white gold instead of the yellow gold used at the other academies. Each class designs its own class crest; the only requirements being that each crest include all the elements on the Class of 1959&#39;s crest: the class number, the class year, the Polaris star, and the eagle. One side of the ring bears the academy crest, while the other side bears the class crest; the center bezel bears the words United States Air Force Academy. Cadets choose their own stones for the center of the ring. The rings are received at the Ring Dance at the beginning of the Graduation Week festivities for the class ahead of the ring recipients. The rings traditionally are placed in glasses of champagne and are caught in the teeth following a toast. During the cadet&#39;s first class (senior) year, the ring is worn with the class crest facing the wearer; following graduation, the ring is turned so that the class crest faces out. The rings of all the academies were originally designed to be worn on the left hand, so that the wearer reads the name of the academy on the bezel while a cadet or midshipman and others can read it after graduation, the rings are now worn on either hand. The Academy&#39;s Association of Graduates (AOG) accepts rings of deceased graduates which are melted down to form an ingot of white gold from which a portion of all future rings are made.[67] Both the academy&#39;s Association of Graduates and the Academy Library maintain displays of class rings.
The first Honor scandal broke in 1965, when a resigning cadet reported knowing of more than 100 cadets who had been involved in a cheating ring. One hundred and nine cadets were ultimately expelled. Cheating scandals plagued the Academy again in 1967, 1972, 1984, 2004,[68] 2007,[69] 2012, and 2014. Following each of these events, the Academy thoroughly examined the etiology of the mass cheating in addition to alleged excessive pressures that the academic system at the time placed on cadets and made changes in attempts to reduce the opportunities for future incidents
The sexual assault scandal that broke in 2003 forced the Academy to look more closely at how effectively women had been integrated into cadet life; concerns with sexual assault, hazing of male cadets, and the disciplinary process during this period were detailed in a 2010 book by a former cadet.[70] Following the scandal and rising concerns about sexual assault throughout the U.S. military, the Department of Defense established a task force to investigate sexual harassment and assault at each of the United States service academies. The report also revealed 92 incidents of reported sexual assault.[71] At the same time, the Academy implemented programs to combat sexual assault, harassment and gender bias. The new programs actively encourage prompt sexual assault reporting. The Academy&#39;s decisive actions of zero tolerance were praised by officials and experts.[72]
Following the 2003 crisis, the Department of Defense directed its attention to the problem of sexual harassment and assault at the military academies. The Department of Defense claimed that the program was successful although during the school year 2010Ã¿11 there were increased reports of sexual assault at the academy; however, one goal of the program is increased reporting.[73] There have been several attempts to prosecute cadets for rape since 2003, but only three have been successful convictions, citing the confidential informant program that ran from 2011-2012. The informant program was led by former AFOSI agent Brandon Enos, AFOSI&#39;s most successful agent in Air Force Academy&#39;s history in combating sexual assault and drug use amongst cadets. After the confidential informant program was mysteriously disbanded in 2013 on orders from General Johnson, sexual assault reporting fell by half. On 5 January 2012 rape charges were preferred against cadets in three unrelated cases.[74] To help combat these problems, the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) created a system of cadet informants to hunt for misconduct among students.[75] According to The New York Times in Academic Year 2014, &quot;after the informant program ended with no further convictions, reports fell by half.&quot;[76]
The New York Times has cited a letter to Congress from former AFOSI Agent, Staff Sergeant Brandon Enos, who said that Lieutenant General Michael C. Gould, the superintendent from 2009 to 2013 and a former quarterback on the team, had repeatedly interfered in cases involving football players. In turn Gould said to the Times that the suggestion that he had interfered with the investigation preposterous.&quot;[76] Gould was found guilty by a report from the Pentagon in June 2016 of interfering with AFOSI investigations from 2011-2012, including blocking an investigation into the football coaches. Gould was removed from the College Football Selection Committee but was able to retain his retirement pay.[citation needed]
These and other problems again rose to national prominence in the summer of 2014 when The Gazette broke an investigation into behavior by Academy cadets and faculty that included allegations of drug use, alcohol abuse, cheating, and sexual assault. This behavior, described as &quot;so wild that AFOSI leaders canceled a planned 2012 sting out of concern that undercover agents and confidential informants at a party wouldn&#39;t be enough to protect women from rape,&quot; prompted the Academy superintendent to call for an investigation of the Academy&#39;s athletic department.[77]
In 2005, allegations surfaced that some Evangelical Christian cadets and staff were effectively engaging in religious proselytizing at the Academy.[78] These allegations, along with concerns over how the Air Force handles other religious issues, prompted Academy graduate Michael L. Weinstein to file a lawsuit against the Air Force.[79][80] An Air Force panel investigated the accusations and issued a report on 22 June 2005.[81] The panel&#39;s investigation found a &quot;religious climate that does not involve overt religious discrimination, but a failure to fully accommodate all members needs and a lack of awareness over where the line is drawn between permissible and impermissible expression of beliefs.&quot; Evidence discovered during the investigation included antisemitic remarks, official sponsorship of a showing of the film The Passion of the Christ and a locker room banner that said academy athletes played for &quot;Team Jesus.&quot; In response to the panel&#39;s findings, the Air Force released new guidelines to discourage public prayers at official events or meetings and to facilitate worship by non-Christian religions.[82]
In 2010 the academy set up an outdoor worship area for cadets following Wicca, Neo-Druidism, or other earth-based religions to practice their faiths.[83][84]
A 2010 survey found that 41 percent of academy cadets who identified themselves as non-Christian reported they were subjected to unwanted religious proselytizing at least once or twice last year at the school. The survey&#39;s results, however, showed that the number of cadets who felt pressured to join in religious activities had declined from previous years. Colorado congressman Mike Coffman criticized the academy for resisting calls to release details of the survey&#39;s results.[85][86]
In 2012, 66 House Republicans complained about policies set in place the last September to curtail requirements to attend religious events.[87]

Monument Avenue is an avenue in Richmond, Virginia with a tree-lined grassy mall dividing the east- and westbound traffic and is punctuated by statues memorializing Virginian Confederate participants of the American Civil War, including Robert E. Lee, J.E.B. Stuart, Jefferson Davis, Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, and Matthew Fontaine Maury. There is also a monument to Arthur Ashe, a Richmond native and international tennis star who was African-American. The first monument, a statue of Robert E. Lee, was erected in 1890. Between 1900 and 1925, Monument Avenue greatly expanded with architecturally significant houses, churches and apartment buildings.[4]
Monument Avenue is the site of several annual events, particularly in the spring, including an annual Monument Avenue 10K race.[5] At various times (such as Robert E. Lee&#39;s birthday and Confederate History Month) the Sons of Confederate Veterans gather along Monument Avenue in period military costumes. Monument Avenue is also the site of &quot;Easter on Parade,&quot; [6] another spring tradition during which many Richmonders stroll the avenue wearing Easter bonnets and other finery.
&quot;Monument Avenue Historic District&quot; includes the part of Monument Avenue begins at the termination of West Franklin Street at Stuart Circle in the east extending westward for some fourteen blocks to Roseneath Avenue in the west, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark District.[7] In 2007, the American Planning Association named Monument Avenue one of the 10 Great Streets in the country.[8] The APA said Monument Avenue was selected for its historic architecture, urban form, quality residential and religious architecture, diversity of land uses, public art and integration of multiple modes of transportation.[9]


Monument Avenue was conceived during a site search for a memorial statue of General Robert E. Lee after Lee&#39;s death in 1870. Richmond citizens had been wanting to erect statues for three Virginians who had helped defend the city (two of whom were killed in the defense). City plans as early as 1887 show the proposed site, a circle of land, just past the end of West Franklin Street, a premier downtown residential avenue. The land was owned by a wealthy Richmonder, Otway C. Allen. The plan for the statue included building a grand avenue extending west lined with trees along a central grassy median. The plan shows building plots which Allen intended to sell to developers and those wishing to build houses on the new grand avenue.
On May 29, 1890, crowds were estimated at 100,000 to view the unveiling of the first monument, to Robert E. Lee.[10]
It would take about 10 years for wealthy Richmonders and speculative developers to start buying the lots and building houses along the avenue, but in the years between 1900 and 1925 Monument Avenue exploded with architecturally significant houses, churches and apartment buildings. The architects who built on Monument Avenue practiced in the region and nationally, and included the firms of John Russell Pope, William Bottomley, Duncan Lee, Marcellus Wright, Claude Howell, Henry Baskervill, D. Wiley Anderson and Albert Huntt. Speculative builders such as W. J. Payne, Harvey C. Brown and the Davis Brothers bought lots and built many houses to sell to those not designing with an architect.
The street was originally, and continues to be, a favored living area for Richmond&#39;s upper class. It (especially the Fan District section) is lined with enormous mansions from the end of the gilded age. The Museum District part of Monument Avenue includes a combination of such houses (especially in the 3100 block), apartment buildings and smaller single-family houses. West of Interstate 195, Monument Avenue becomes a more commonplace suburban avenue.
Through the decades the avenue has had its ups and downs. As early as 1910, but mostly during the 1950s and &#39;60s, many of the large houses were subdivided into apartments, or interior rooms and carriage houses were let to boarders. A few houses were demolished to make way for parking lots or building expansions, and several modern additions were tucked between earlier existing buildings. But protections put in place by the city by designating Monument Avenue as an Old and Historic Neighborhood have helped maintain the integrity of the neighborhood. In 1969 a group was incorporated called The Residents and Associates for the Preservation of Monument Avenue, led by Zayde Rennolds Dotts (Mrs. Walter Dotts, Jr.),[11] granddaughter of Beulah and John Kerr Branch, who had commissioned a house on Monument Avenue in 1914 by the firm of John Russell Pope. In 1970 the group changed its name to the Monument Avenue Preservation Society (MAPS).
In August 2017, following violence linked to far right white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, VA, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney announced that the city&#39;s Monument Avenue commission would include potential removal of the confederate statues as an option for dealing with the issues raised by statues glorifying the legacy of the south. [12]
Starting from the east the first from downtown is traffic circle known as Stuart Circle after the termination of West Franklin Street and the beginning of Monument Avenue and cross street of Lombardy. In Stuart Circle is the J.E.B. Stuart Monument, an equestrian bronze statue sitting atop a granite base. The statue which was sculpted by Fred Moynihan of New York was the second monument unveiled on Monument Ave in 1907 and was inspired of the British General Outram sculpture in Calcutta. Stuart is turned in the saddle facing east while the horse faces north. The horses stance has been viewed as being awkward by many Virginians.[14]
Plans for the sculpture was first discussed publicly as early as 1875, however the competition was not done held until 1903. Fitzhugh Lee again chaired the selection committee, as he had for the Lee Monument. The site location was chosen in 1904 as Stuart was one of the two whom died helping to defend the city that citizens had been wanting to memorialize in a house nearby. At the same time plans for the third Davis Monument was being planned further west at Monument Ave and Cedar Street. The dual unveiling drew large crowds even larger than the Lee unveiling. Crowds were estimated between 80,000 - 200,000 which included 18,000 veteran attendees who camped out for the week.[15]
One block west of Stuart Circle is the big traffic circle of Lee Circle. The Robert E. Lee Monument was the first and is the largest of the street&#39;s monuments.[16]
Four blocks to the west of Lee Circle is a tall central column surrounded by a Doric colonnade of the impressive Davis Memorial unveiled in 1907. The United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) had been appealing to include a Jefferson Davis memorial and in 1904 the first addition to the plan was made. UDC chose the site as it had been the former location of Star Fort, the innermost westward protection for Richmond. The defenses is also marked by a cannon just to the east of Davis Memorial.
Three blocks west of Davis Memorial is the equestrian statue of Stonewall Jackson located at corner of Monument Ave and Boulevard.
The &quot;Pathfinder of the Seas&quot; monument of Matthew Fontaine Maury is located on Monument Avenue at Belmont Avenue,[17] closest to the Arthur Ashe monument. The Maury monument is not a Confederate war monument per se, demonstrating little indication of his role in the Confederate war, which included serving as chief of sea coast, river and harbor defenses and acquiring ships and supplies for the Confederacy through his work in the Confederate Secret Service in Europe, mainly in Ireland, France and England. When the Sons of Confederate Veterans celebrate Confederate History Month or Lee-Jackson Day by parading in period military costumes from east to west on Monument Avenue, they make a turn before they get to the Maury monument, a further indication that Commander Maury&#39;s monument is not a Civil War monument. Most of the Confederate veterans were gone when Monument Avenue turned to the sciences with the 1929 statue to Maury.
In 1915 the Matthew Fontaine Maury Association was founded with the purpose of erecting a monument to Maury though serious fundraising did not happen until after the end of the First World War. Eventually the United Daughters of the Confederacy joined in the fundraising, the State Virginia and the City of Richmond each donated $1,000, and even President Wilson, a native Virginian, joined the Association.[18]
The committee selected Richmond sculptor Frederick William Sievers, the author of many Lost Cause memorials, to produce the work and he created the &quot;most allegorical of Richmonds monuments. [19] The monument was unveiled as part of an Armistice Day celebration on November 11, 1929. [20]
The figure of Maury faces eastward, toward the Atlantic Ocean that the &quot;Pathfinder of the Seas&quot; charted. He holds in his left hand a pencil and compass and in his right hand a copy of his charts. Beside his left foot is his book, Physical Geography of the Sea, as well as a Bible, indicating the central role that faith played in Maury&#39;s life. A globe of the Earth is tilted slightly on its axis behind his head. It represents both land and sea, and the woman standing calmly is a representation of Mother Nature between the land and sea. Around the base of the globe are depictions of people clinging to a sinking boat in bad weather representing the dangers of the sea with a woman in the center, and on the right (north) side of the globe there is a farmer, boy and a dog representing Maury&#39;s work promoting land weather service, which dates back further than 1853. Maury attended the International Meteorological Organization in Brussels, Belgium on August 23, 1853, where Maury, leading the way for this conference with his ideas of land and sea weather predictions and representing the United States, promoted his ideas of safety on both land and at sea to many nations which agreed to follow his ideas. Every maritime nation had its ships reporting to Maury at the National (later Naval) Observatory in Washington D.C. These elements represent Maury&#39;s work with atmospheric science, to the benefit of all mankind and their enterprises on land and on the sea. Weather warnings and reports had been dreams of Maury during his lifetime up until when he died and he was successful in his work. He thought of the ships at sea as &quot;a thousand temples of science for all of humanity&quot; and believed these brought men and nations closer together in a common self-protection against storms and deaths. There are fish, dolphins, jellyfish and birds around the monument&#39;s perimeter.
The decision to place the statue of Arthur Ashe by Paul DiPasquale on Monument Avenue was controversial.[21] Detractors pointed to a lack of correlation between the Richmond native tennis star and Confederate leaders. Some residents thought the monument should be placed at the Arthur Ashe Athletic Center instead. The monument became a focal point of racial tensions in the city around the times of its commission and its unveiling. Many of the city&#39;s majority African American residents cited Ashe&#39;s distinguished place in the modern history of the city as a reason for inclusion, while some residents and other parties rejected it as inappropriate for Monument Avenue, which until 1996 contained only statues of men with a relationship to the Confederate States of America.
The controversy over the statue may have also been driven by design and placement choices. Ashe&#39;s statue is much smaller than those of most of the Confederate leaders and is the farthest from downtown Richmond, situated just outside the city&#39;s Fan district.</div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button">See more</button></section><!--]--></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright Â© 2014-2024 answer</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
