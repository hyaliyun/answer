Maria Elisabeth Ender,&quot;Maria Elisabeth Ender, better known as Mariska Veres (?pronunciation?(help{info)) (1 October 1947 Ã¿ 2 December 2006), was a Dutch singer who was best known as the lead singer of the rock group Shocking Blue. Described as being similar to a young Cher, she was known for her sultry voice, eccentric performances, and her striking appearance which featured kohl-rimmed eyes, high cheekbones, and long jet black hair, which was actually a wig.[1][2]

Veres was born in The Hague. Her father was the Hungarian Romani violinist Lajos Veres (1912-1981), and her mother, Maria Ender (1912-1986), was born in Germany of French and Russian parents.[citation needed]

She often accompanied her father on the piano,[2] along with her elder sister Ilonka, but her youngest sister, Irene, never had a career in music.[citation needed]

Veres began her career as a singer in 1963 with the guitar band Les Mysteres. In 1964 the band recorded an EP (GTB-label, 10 copies only) with Veres singing on side 1: Summertime (solo) and Someone (a duet). In 2010 the EP was re-released by record club Platenclub Utrecht (PLUT 009). In 1965, she sang with the Bumble Bees,[1] and then with the Blue Fighters, Danny and his Favourites and General Four. Later in 1966 she sang with the Motowns with whom she also played organ.

In 1968, she was invited to join Shocking Blue to replace lead singer Fred de Wilde who had to join the army. In 1969/1970 Shocking Blue gained worldwide fame with the hit single &quot;Venus&quot;. The month of their arrival in the United States gossip columnist Earl Wilson referred to Veres as a &#39;beautiful busty girl.&#39;[3]

When Shocking Blue split up on 1 June 1974, Veres continued in a solo career until the band was reunited in 1984. This comeback turned out to be successful, but one of the other original members, Robbie van Leeuwen, stepped back from the group, partly because he had moved to Luxembourg but also due to the success of Bananarama&#39;s cover of &quot;Venus&quot;.

Veres started the jazz group The Shocking Jazz Quintet in 1993, and recorded an album (Shocking You) with pop songs from the 1960s and 1970s, now in a jazz version. From 1993 to 2006 she performed in yet another reincarnation of Shocking Blue (recorded the songs &quot;Body and Soul&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;, both produced by former member Robbie van Leeuwen), and also recorded an album with Andrei Serban in 2003, named Gipsy Heart, going back to her Romani roots. 

A version of &quot;Venus&quot; was posthumously released in 2007, a few months after her death, recorded with pianist/bandleader Dolf de Vries (on the album Another Touch). Veres recorded &quot;Venus&quot; four times: with Shocking Blue (1969), with the Mariska Veres Shocking Jazz Quintet (1993), with Formula Diablos (in English/Spanish, 1997), and with Dolf de Vries (a lounge version of &quot;Venus&quot;, 2005-06).

Mariska Veres died of gall bladder cancer on 2 December 2006, aged 59, just three weeks after the disease was discovered.[4][5]

She had a long-term relationship with guitarist Andr van Geldorp, but never married or had children.[6] Reminiscing to the Belgian magazine Flair, she remarked about her early fame, &quot;I was just a painted doll (back in those days), nobody could ever reach me. Nowadays, I am more open to people.&quot;[1]ðŸš¨Who is the lead singer of shocking blue?</div></div><div class="card" data-v-6d980f66><div class="question" data-v-6d980f66>What is the outermost layer of the atmosphere called?</div><div class="separator" data-v-6d980f66></div><div class="answer" data-v-6d980f66>exosphereðŸš¨The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, commonly known as air, that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth&#39;s gravity. The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth&#39;s surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).
By volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen,[2] 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air content and atmospheric pressure vary at different layers, and air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth&#39;s troposphere and in artificial atmospheres.
The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15G1018?kg,[3] three quarters of which is within about 11?km (6.8?mi; 36,000?ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. The Krmn line, at 100?km (62?mi), or 1.57% of Earth&#39;s radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around 120?km (75?mi). Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.
The study of Earth&#39;s atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology). Early pioneers in the field include Lon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.[4]


The three major constituents of Earth&#39;s atmosphere, are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around 10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor).[5] The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,[6] among which are the greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine (elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.
(A) volume fraction is equal to mole fraction for ideal gas only,
????also see volume (thermodynamics)
(B) ppmv: parts per million by volume
(C) Water vapor is about 0.25% by mass over full atmosphere
(D) Water vapor strongly varies locally[5]
The relative concentration of gasses remains constant until about 10,000?m (33,000?ft).[9]
In general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the temperature section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings, the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth&#39;s atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, the atmosphere has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.[10] From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:
The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth&#39;s atmosphere (i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase, which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700?km above sea level, to about 10,000?km (6,200?mi; 33,000,000?ft) where it merges into the solar wind.
This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free-moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind.
The exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, the aurora borealis and aurora australis sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.
The thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth&#39;s atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about 80?km (50?mi; 260,000?ft) up to the thermopause at an altitude range of 500Ã¿1000?km (310Ã¿620?mi; 1,600,000Ã¿3,300,000?ft). The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity.[11] Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase. The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550 kilometres (50 to 342?mi) above Earth&#39;s surface, contains the ionosphere.
The temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature inversion is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise as high as 1500?C (2700?F), though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of oxygen, for example) travels an average of 1 kilometre (0.62?mi; 3300?ft) between collisions with other molecules.[13] Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.
This layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between 350 and 420?km (220 and 260?mi).
The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth&#39;s atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about 50?km (31?mi; 160,000?ft) to the mesopause at 80Ã¿85?km (50Ã¿53?mi; 260,000Ã¿280,000?ft) above sea level.
Temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around ?85?C (?120?F; 190?K).[14][15]
Just below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar-mesospheric noctilucent clouds. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon. Lightning-induced discharges known as transient luminous events (TLEs) occasionally form in the mesosphere above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket-powered aircraft.
The stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth&#39;s atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly 12?km (7.5?mi; 39,000?ft) above Earth&#39;s surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 to 55?km (31 to 34?mi; 164,000 to 180,000?ft).
The atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the pressure at sea level. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth&#39;s atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation (UV) radiation from the Sun by the ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be ?60?C (?76?F; 210?K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near 0?C.[16]
The stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.
The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth&#39;s atmosphere. It extends from Earth&#39;s surface to an average height of about 12?km, although this altitude actually varies from about 9?km (30,000?ft) at the poles to 17?km (56,000?ft) at the equator,[12] with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause, a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion (i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is isothermal with height.[17][18]
Although variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere (i.e. Earth&#39;s surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing (hence the origin of its name in the Greek word ??, tropos, meaning &quot;turn&quot;). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the mass of Earth&#39;s atmosphere.[19] The troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower 5.6?km (18,000?ft) of the troposphere.
Nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth&#39;s weather takes place. It has basically all the weather-associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.
Within the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:
The average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth&#39;s surface is 14?C (57?F; 287?K)[22] or 15?C (59?F; 288?K),[23] depending on the reference.[24][25][26]
The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the International Standard Atmosphere as 101325 pascals (760.00?Torr; 14.6959?psi; 760.00?mmHg). This is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres (atm). Total atmospheric mass is 5.1480G1018 kg (1.135G1019 lb),[28] about 2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth&#39;s area of 51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth&#39;s mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and weather.
If the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of 8.50?km (27,900?ft). It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every 5.6?km (18,000?ft) or by a factor of 1/e every 7.64?km (25,100?ft), the average scale height of the atmosphere below 70?km (43?mi; 230,000?ft). However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.
In summary, the mass of Earth&#39;s atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:[29]
By comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at 8,848?m (29,029?ft); commercial airliners typically cruise between 10?km (33,000?ft) and 13?km (43,000?ft) where the thinner air improves fuel economy; weather balloons reach 30.4?km (100,000?ft) and above; and the highest X-15 flight in 1963 reached 108.0?km (354,300?ft).
Even above the Krmn line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur. Meteors begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth&#39;s ionosphere, important to HF radio propagation, begin below 100?km and extend beyond 500?km. By comparison, the International Space Station and Space Shuttle typically orbit at 350Ã¿400?km, within the F-layer of the ionosphere where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700Ã¿800?km.
The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11?km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the stratosphere, starting above about 20?km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named thermosphere above 90?km.
Because in an ideal gas of constant composition the speed of sound depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.
The density of air at sea level is about 1.2?kg/m3 (1.2?g/L, 0.0012 g/cm3). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the ideal gas law). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.
The average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5G1015) tonnes or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American National Center for Atmospheric Research, &quot;The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480G1018?kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5G1015?kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27G1016?kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 I0.0003G1018?kg.&quot;
Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.[31][32]
When light passes through Earth&#39;s atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun&#39;s rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.
Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O2 and O3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometers. Water (H2O) absorbs many wavelengths above 700?nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.
The combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave &quot;windows&quot; of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The optical window runs from around 300?nm (ultraviolet-C) up into the range humans can see, the visible spectrum (commonly called light), at roughly 400Ã¿700?nm and continues to the infrared to around 1100?nm. There are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves.
Emission is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their &quot;black body&quot; emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately 6,000?K (5,730?C; 10,340?F), its radiation peaks near 500?nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately 290?K (17?C; 62?F), so its radiation peaks near 10,000?nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.
Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth&#39;s surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.
The greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are CO2 and H2O.
The refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than 1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of Earth&#39;s surface.
The refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the mirage.
Atmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means (with ocean circulation) by which heat is distributed around Earth. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth&#39;s rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.
The first atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia.[33]
Outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert gases.[33] A major part of carbon-dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments. Water-related sediments have been found that date from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.[34]
About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable &quot;second atmosphere&quot;. The influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life-forms appear as early as 3.5 billion years ago.[35] How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the &quot;faint young Sun paradox&quot;.
The geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of Earth Ã¿ with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late Archean Eon an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing cyanobacteria (see Great Oxygenation Event), which have been found as stromatolite fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy (isotope ratio proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as 4 billion years ago.
Ancient sediments in the Gabon dating from between about 2,150 and 2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth&#39;s dynamic oxygenation evolution. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion.[36]
The constant re-arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations.
Before this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen. This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere. O2 showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.[39] The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic Eon, during the earliest period of which, the Cambrian, oxygen-requiring metazoan life forms began to appear.
The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago, significantly higher than today&#39;s 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, releasing oxygen. Breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today&#39;s atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is great enough for this rapid development of animals.[40]
Air pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms.[41] Stratospheric ozone depletion is caused by air pollution, chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances.
The scientific consensus is that the anthropogenic greenhouse gases currently accumulating in the atmosphere are the main cause of global warming.[42]

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald&#39;s magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.[1][2]
Fitzgeraldinspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island&#39;s north shorebegan planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, &quot;something newsomething extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.&quot;[3] Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book&#39;s title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue.
First published by Scribner&#39;s in April 1925, The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly; in its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title &quot;Great American Novel&quot;. In 1998, the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century&#39;s best American novel and second best English-language novel of the same time period.[4]


Set on the prosperous Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby provides a critical social history of America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative. That era, known for widespread economic prosperity, the development of jazz music, flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture, and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald&#39;s novel. Fitzgerald uses many of these societal developments of the 1920s that were to build Gatsby&#39;s stories from many of the simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald&#39;s discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which was the source of Gatsby&#39;s fortune.[5] Fitzgerald depicts the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing the book&#39;s plotline within the historical context of the era.[6]
Fitzgerald&#39;s visits to Long Island&#39;s north shore and his experience attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsby&#39;s setting. Today, there are a number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land&#39;s End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party.[7] Many of the events in Fitzgerald&#39;s early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and, like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick&#39;s case, Yale). Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant and was stationed at Camp Sheridan in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success.[8] Like Nick in The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich.[8] In many ways, The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald&#39;s attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, even as she led him toward everything he despised.[8]
In her book Careless People: Murder, Mayhem and the Invention of &#39;The Great Gatsby (2013), Sarah Churchwell speculates that parts of the ending of The Great Gatsby were based on the Hall-Mills Case.[9] Based on her forensic search for clues, she asserts that the two victims in the Hall-Mills murder case inspired the characters who were murdered in The Great Gatsby.[10]
In the summer of 1922, Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate and veteran of the Great War from the Midwestwho serves as the novel&#39;s narratortakes a job in New York as a bond salesman. He rents a small house on Long Island, in the fictional village of West Egg, next door to the lavish mansion of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious multi-millionaire who holds extravagant parties but does not participate in them. Nick drives around the bay to East Egg for dinner at the home of his cousin, Daisy Fay Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, a college acquaintance of Nick&#39;s. They introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, an attractive, cynical young golfer. She reveals to Nick that Tom has a mistress, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the &quot;valley of ashes&quot;,[11] an industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle to an apartment where Tom keeps his affairs with Myrtle and others. At Tom&#39;s New York apartment, a vulgar and bizarre party takes place. It ends with Tom breaking Myrtle&#39;s nose after she annoys him by saying Daisy&#39;s name several times.
Nick eventually receives an invitation to one of Gatsby&#39;s parties. Nick encounters Jordan Baker at the party and they meet Gatsby himself, an aloof and surprisingly young man who recognizes Nick from their same division in the Great War. Through Jordan, Nick later learns that Gatsby knew Daisy through a purely chance meeting in 1917 when Daisy and her friends were doing volunteer services&#39; work with young officers headed to Europe. From their brief meetings and casual encounters at that time, Gatsby became (and still is) deeply in love with Daisy. Gatsby had hoped that his wild parties would attract an unsuspecting Daisy, who lived across the bay, to appear at his doorstep and allow him to present himself as a man of wealth and position.
Having developed a budding friendship with Nick, Gatsby uses him to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy. Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy begin an affair over the summer. At a luncheon at the Buchanans&#39; house, Daisy speaks to Gatsby with such undisguised intimacy that Tom realizes she is in love with Gatsby. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is outraged by his wife&#39;s infidelity. He forces the group to drive into New York City and confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel, asserting that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand. In addition to that, he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal whose fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt her.
On the way back, Gatsby&#39;s car strikes and kills Tom&#39;s mistress, Myrtle. Nick later learns from Gatsby that Daisy, not Gatsby himself, was driving the car at the time of the accident. Myrtle&#39;s husband, George Wilson, falsely concludes that the driver of the yellow car is the secret lover he suspects she has. He learns that the yellow car is Gatsby&#39;s, fatally shoots him and then turns the gun on himself. Nick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for Gatsby which none of Gatsby&#39;s associates attend and only one of his partygoers (besides Nick) attends. Later, Nick runs into Tom in New York and finds out that Tom had told George that the yellow car was Gatsby&#39;s and gave him Gatsby&#39;s address. Disillusioned with the East, Nick moves back to the Midwest.
Fitzgerald began planning his third novel in June 1922,[5] but it was interrupted by production of his play, The Vegetable, in the summer and fall.[20] The play failed miserably, and Fitzgerald worked that winter on magazine stories struggling to pay his debt caused by the production.[21][22] The stories were, in his words, &quot;all trash and it nearly broke my heart,&quot;[22] although included among those stories was &quot;Winter Dreams&quot;, which Fitzgerald later described as &quot;a sort of first draft of the Gatsby idea&quot;.[23]
After the birth of their child, the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck, New York, on Long Island, in October 1922. The town was used as the scene of The Great Gatsby.[24] Fitzgerald&#39;s neighbors in Great Neck included such prominent and newly wealthy New Yorkers as writer Ring Lardner, actor Lew Fields, and comedian Ed Wynn.[5] These figures were all considered to be &quot;new money&quot;, unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck or Cow Neck Peninsula, places which were home to many of New York&#39;s wealthiest established families, and which sat across the bay from Great Neck. This real-life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for &quot;West Egg&quot; and &quot;East Egg&quot;. In this novel, Great Neck (King&#39;s Point) became the &quot;new money&quot; peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington (Sands Point) the old-money East Egg.[25] Several mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby&#39;s home, such as Oheka Castle[26] and Beacon Towers, since demolished.[27]
By mid-1923, Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel[28] but discarded most of his new story as a false start, some of which resurfaced in the 1924 short story &quot;Absolution&quot;.[5][29]
Work on The Great Gatsby began in earnest in April 1924. Fitzgerald wrote in his ledger, &quot;Out of woods at last and starting novel.&quot;[22] He decided to make a departure from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that the novel was to be a &quot;consciously artistic achievement&quot;[30] and a &quot;purely creative worknot trashy imaginings as in my stories but the sustained imagination of a sincere and yet radiant world.&quot;[31] He added later, during editing, that he felt &quot;an enormous power in me now, more than I&#39;ve ever had.&quot;[32] Soon after this burst of inspiration, work slowed while the Fitzgeralds made a move to the French Riviera, where a serious crisis in their relationship soon developed.[22] By August, however, Fitzgerald was hard at work and completed what he believed to be his final manuscript in October, sending the book to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, and agent, Harold Ober, on October 30.[22] The Fitzgeralds then moved to Rome for the winter.[33] Fitzgerald made revisions through the winter after Perkins informed him in a November letter that the character of Gatsby was &quot;somewhat vague&quot; and Gatsby&#39;s wealth and business, respectively, needed &quot;the suggestion of an explanation&quot; and should be &quot;adumbrated&quot;.[34]
Content after a few rounds of revision, Fitzgerald returned the final batch of revised galleys in the middle of February 1925.[35] Fitzgerald&#39;s revisions included an extensive rewriting of Chapter VI and VIII.[22] Despite this, he refused an offer of $10,000 for the serial rights in order not to delay the book&#39;s publication.[22] He had received a $3,939 advance in 1923[36] and $1,981.25 upon publication.[37]
The cover of the first printing of The Great Gatsby is among the most celebrated pieces of art in American literature.[38] It depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline, with images of naked women reflected in the irises. A little-known artist named Francis Cugat was commissioned to illustrate the book while Fitzgerald was in the midst of writing it.[38] The cover was completed before the novel; Fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had &quot;written it into&quot; the novel.[38] Fitzgerald&#39;s remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist Dr. T. J. Eckleburg[39] (depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson&#39;s auto repair shop) which Fitzgerald described as &quot;blue and gigantic?Ã¿ their retinas[note 2] are one yard high. They look out of no face, but instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose.&quot; Although this passage has some resemblance to the painting, a closer explanation can be found in the description of Daisy Buchanan as the &quot;girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs.&quot;[38] Ernest Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that when Fitzgerald lent him a copy of The Great Gatsby to read, he immediately disliked the cover, but &quot;Scott told me not to be put off by it, that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in Long Island that was important in the story. He said he had liked the jacket and now he didn&#39;t like it.&quot;[40]
Fitzgerald had difficulty choosing a title for his novel and entertained many choices before reluctantly choosing The Great Gatsby,[41] a title inspired by Alain-Fournier&#39;s Le Grand Meaulnes.[42] Prior, Fitzgerald shifted between Gatsby; Among Ash-Heaps and Millionaires; Trimalchio;[41] Trimalchio in West Egg;[43] On the Road to West Egg;[43] Under the Red, White, and Blue;[41] The Gold-Hatted Gatsby;[41][43] and The High-Bouncing Lover.[41][43] The titles The Gold-Hatted Gatsby and The High-Bouncing Lover came from Fitzgerald&#39;s epigraph for the novel, one which he wrote himself under the pen name of Thomas Parke D&#39;Invilliers.[44] He initially preferred titles referencing Trimalchio, the crude parvenu in Petronius&#39;s Satyricon, and even refers to Gatsby as Trimalchio once in the novel: &quot;It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday nightand, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.&quot;[45] Unlike Gatsby&#39;s spectacular parties, Trimalchio participated in the audacious and libidinous orgies he hosted but, according to Tony Tanner&#39;s introduction to the Penguin edition, there are subtle similarities between the two.[46]
In November 1924, Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins that &quot;I have now decided to stick to the title I put on the book?... Trimalchio in West Egg&quot;[47] but was eventually persuaded that the reference was too obscure and that people would not be able to pronounce it.[48] His wife, Zelda, and Perkins both expressed their preference for The Great Gatsby and the next month Fitzgerald agreed.[49] A month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, he asked if it would be possible to re-title it Trimalchio or Gold-Hatted Gatsby but Perkins advised against it. On March 19, 1925,[50] Fitzgerald expressed intense enthusiasm for the title Under the Red, White and Blue, but it was at that stage too late to change.[51][52] The Great Gatsby was published on April 10, 1925.[53] Fitzgerald remarked that &quot;the title is only fair, rather bad than good.&quot;[54]
Early drafts of the novel entitled Trimalchio: An Early Version of The Great Gatsby have been published.[55][56] A notable difference between the Trimalchio draft and The Great Gatsby is a less complete failure of Gatsby&#39;s dream in Trimalchio. Another difference is that the argument between Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby is more even,[57] although Daisy still returns to Tom.
Sarah Churchwell sees The Great Gatsby as a &quot;cautionary tale of the decadent downside of the American dream.&quot; The story deals with the limits and realities of America&#39;s ideals of social and class mobility; and the inevitably hopeless lower class aspirations to rise above the station(s) of their birth. The book in stark relief through the narrator, Nick Carraway, observes that: &quot;... a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.&quot; [58] Using elements of irony and tragic ending, it also delves into themes of excesses of the rich, and recklessness of youth.[59][60] Journalist Nick Gillespie sees The Great Gatsby as a story &quot;underlying permanence of class differences; even in the face of a modern economy&#39;s attempt to assert that the class structure is based; not on status and inherited position; but, upon the innovation and the ability of literally anyone, to succeed by meeting the ever-changing demands and tastes of consumers&#39; needs.&quot;[61] This interpretation asserts that The Great Gatsby captures the American experience because it is a story about change and those who resist it; whether the change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants (Southern Europeans in the early 20th century, Latin Americans today), the nouveau riche, or successful minorities, Americans from the 1920s to the 21st century have plenty of experience with changing economic and social circumstances. As Gillespie states, &quot;While the specific terms of the equation are always changing, it&#39;s easy to see echoes of Gatsby&#39;s basic conflict between established sources of economic and cultural power and upstarts in virtually all aspects of American society.&quot;[61] Because this concept is particularly American and can be seen throughout American history, readers are able to relate to The Great Gatsby (which has lent the novel an enduring popularity).[61]
Later critical writings on The Great Gatsby, following the novel&#39;s revival, focus in particular on Fitzgerald&#39;s disillusionment with the American Dream?Ã¿ life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?Ã¿ in the context of the hedonistic Jazz Age, a name for the era which Fitzgerald said he had coined. In 1970, Roger Pearson published the article &quot;Gatsby: False prophet of the American Dream&quot;, in which he states that Fitzgerald &quot;has come to be associated with this concept of the AMERICAN Dream more than any other writer of the twentieth century&quot;.[62] Pearson goes on to suggest that Gatsby&#39;s failure to realize the American dream demonstrates that it no longer exists except in the minds of those as materialistic as Gatsby. He concludes that the American dream pursued by Gatsby &quot;is, in reality, a nightmare&quot;, bringing nothing but discontent and disillusionment to those who chase it as they realize its unsustainability and ultimately its unattainability.
In addition to exploring the trials and tribulations of achieving the great American dream during the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby explores societal gender expectations as a theme, exemplifying in Daisy Buchanan&#39;s character the marginalization of women in the East Egg social class that Fitzgerald depicts. As an upper-class, white woman living in East Egg during this time period in America, Daisy must adhere to certain societal expectations, including but certainly not limited to actively filling the role of dutiful wife, mother, keeper of the house, and charming socialite. As the reader finds in the novel, many of Daisy&#39;s choices, ultimately culminating in the tragedy of the plot and misery for all those involved, can be at least partly attributed to her prescribed role as a &quot;beautiful little fool&quot; who is completely reliant on her husband for financial and societal security. For instance, one could argue that Daisy&#39;s ultimate decision to remain with her husband despite her feelings for Gatsby can be attributed to the status, security, and comfort that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides. Additionally, the theme of the female familial role within The Great Gatsby goes hand in hand with that of the ideal family unit associated with the great American dream Ã¿ a dream that goes unrealized for Gatsby and Daisy in Fitzgerald&#39;s prose.[63]
The symbol of the green light serves as a guiding device for understanding Gatsbys American dream and Nicks unreliable narration and jealousy. The green light shines across the dock from Gatsbys house and is frequently mentioned in the background of the plot and is a symbol for money, jealousy, and sickness. Additionally, the green light outlines how Gatsbys desire for wealth and love creates a web of problems. Throughout the novel, the protagonist becomes infatuated with things which distort his understanding of happiness. Gatsbys fixation with possessions shine the green light of money.
The symbol is subtle, but always present among the many conflicts occurring. The meaning of the light changes throughout the novel, but first begins as a sign of hope. Nick notes, he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock [5]). After Nick reconnects with Daisy, he returns to his house and notices Gatsby and then, the green light is introduced. This sequence of events serves as a sign of positivity that Gatsby is reuniting with Daisy. The symbols meaning early on sets an optimistic tone for the novel.
At first, the green light presents a positive correlation with Gatsby achieving the American dream. However, the green light symbol also sheds light on the competing desires of money and greed. As Gatsby attempts to become closer to his dream, his connection with Daisy fades and is tarnished by his materialism and her perplexing relationship with Tom. The green light is a combination of what is both great and flawed in the novel, especially when considering Gatsbys dream. Fitzgerald believes the dream is a mirage that entices us to keep moving forward even as we are ceaselessly borne back into the past[5]. His narration suggests that even as the world advances, people will also revert to history and tradition. The American dream will always be both desirable and unreachable because the perception of a dream or perfection is always changing just as characterized with Gatsby who consistently pursues love and money, but fails in the end. Evidently, the American Dream was unattainable from the beginning and the positive green light was not meant to last.
The green lights positivity in the beginning of the novel fails not only Gatsby, but other characters as well. After Gatsby dies, Nick tries to contact Daisy and Tom, but they have moved away and will not be returning East. Nick acknowledges, I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all- Tom and Gatsby Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life [5]. Nick points out that no character, himself included, found success in the East. Nick, Gatsby, Tom and Daisy all came from the western part of the United States and Nick suggests that they may have more success staying in a location familiar to them. Again, the dream proves to be unattainable and the green light of positivity fades.
The greatest conflict within the green light of money is that Gatsby believes money equals achieving his dream, when in fact it does not. To properly address Gatsbys internal conflict between wealth and the American dream, I must first define what it means to achieve the American dream. The dream was a set of ideals for prosperity; each person, no matter their class, race, or religion should have an equal opportunity to achieve success. Gatsby wanted happiness, but his happiness was defined acquiring money or things and love/Daisy in a deceitful way; he earned money dishonestly and was chasing a married woman. Gatsby takes Daisy on an in-depth tour of his home, pointing out Ive got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season [5]. Gatsbys hoping to impress Daisy with his materials from places outside of America, which she ultimately does not care about. It seems that Gatsbys international imports are to show hes even more sophisticated than American materialism. Gatsby is under the impression that money result in love with Daisy, but is sadly mistaken. Gatsbys obsession with money also highlights his lack of substance or personality throughout the novel, the green light fogs his true self. Gatsbys aggressive chase for money shows that he only cares about being wealthy.
Nick demonstrates the green light of jealousy when the Buchanans have him over for dinner. Throughout the novel, Nicks opinion of Tom and Daisy remains consistent Ã¿ and judgmental. His immediate reactions from the scene at their dinner party influence his impressions of them during the rest of the novel. Nick was taken by surprise when Daisy initially told him that she and Tom had moved East permanently; he thought Tom would drift over forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game [5]. Before taking an opportunity to get to know Tom, Nick classifies him as a type of jock hero he knew from college that happens to be dating his cousin. Nick did not anticipate the couple staying together long. Already, Nick is making judgments about Tom, something he promised he would not do, and he is demonstrating jealousy. He views Tom as a transparent upper-class member, and assumes he is the same person he was in college, years later. Nicks ability to assume Toms character comes very easy to him. Additionally, Nicks speculation about Tom is an early indicator that he favors Gatsby. Nick sees no depth to Toms character and finds him unimpressive. Unfortunately, Fitzgerald using Nick as the sole point of view throughout the novel, gives readers a biased view on Tom, deeming Nicks narration unfair. Additionally, Nick summarizes Tom before the dinner party; his mind is made up about him from years ago when the two attended Yale together. Thus, Nicks claim of reserving judgment was insincere from the very beginning and his college jealousy is revealed.
Nicks judgement transitions from Tom to Daisy during their first encounter at dinner. A green light of sickness is revealed when he reunites with Daisy. Nick notes, her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth [5]). Nick senses that Daisy is unhappy even though he knows her to be a lively person. Nick wants Gatsby to be easily understood and is thrown off when she proves to be otherwise. When Tom and Daisy excuse themselves from the table at their dinner gathering, Jordan tells Nick about Toms woman in New York [5]. Nick first has sympathy for Daisys sadness until learning that she is indeed aware of Toms affair. After leaving the dinner party Nick says, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms- but apparently, there were no such intentions in her head [5]. Nick is sick about Daisys decision, but doesnt take into consideration why she is staying with Tom through his infidelity and immediately judges the couple. Nick does not consider the many reasons why Daisy would stay with Tom, but instead assumes the worst of the pair. Also, Nicks opinion that Daisy should drive away with her baby is a harsh statement for someone who is not in her position, has never been married, and does not have a child. Nicks first interactions with other characters convey his judgmental nature. Additionally, Nick becomes sick when Daisy doesnt stand up for herself in front of Tom.
At the end of the novel the green light has reached its final meaning. Nick claims, &quot;Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that&#39;s no matter Ã¿ to-morrow we will run farther, stretch out our arms farther.&quot;[5]. Fitzgerald narrates that the money and hope the green light has provided for characters, is ultimately unattainable. Nick analyzes this symbol precisely through the orgastic future: Gatsby continuously aims for a climax that will come and go. The green light displays the overarching picture of the novel by symbolizing Gatsbys American dream, since it is ever changing and unattainable. As the green light fades throughout the novel, so does Gatsbys dream.
The Great Gatsby was published by Charles Scribner&#39;s Sons on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald called Perkins on the day of publication to monitor reviews: &quot;Any news?&quot;[22] &quot;Sales situation doubtful,&quot; read a wire from Perkins on April 20, &quot;[but] excellent reviews.&quot; Fitzgerald responded on April 24, saying the cable &quot;depressed&quot; him, closing the letter with &quot;Yours in great depression.&quot;[64] Fitzgerald had hoped the novel would be a great commercial success, perhaps selling as many as 75,000 copies.[64] By October, when the original sale had run its course, the book had sold fewer than 20,000 copies.[22][60][64] Despite this, Scribner&#39;s continually kept the book in print; they carried the original edition on their trade list until 1946, by which time Gatsby was in print in three other forms and the original edition was no longer needed.[22] Fitzgerald received letters of praise from contemporaries T. S. Eliot, Edith Wharton, and Willa Cather regarding the novel; however, this was private opinion, and Fitzgerald feverishly demanded the public recognition of reviewers and readers.[22]
The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews from literary critics of the day. Generally the most effusive of the positive reviews was Edwin Clark of The New York Times, who felt the novel was &quot;A curious book, a mystical, glamourous [sic] story of today.&quot;[65] Similarly, Lillian C. Ford of the Los Angeles Times wrote, &quot;[the novel] leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder&quot;, calling the book &quot;a revelation of life&quot; and &quot;a work of art.&quot;[66] The New York Post called the book &quot;fascinating?... His style fairly scintillates, and with a genuine brilliance; he writes surely and soundly.&quot;[67] The New York Herald Tribune was unimpressed, but referred to The Great Gatsby as &quot;purely ephemeral phenomenon, but it contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine-so light, so delicate, so sharp?.... a literary lemon meringue.&quot;[68] In The Chicago Daily Tribune, H. L. Mencken called the book &quot;in form no more than a glorified anecdote, and not too probable at that,&quot; while praising the book&#39;s &quot;careful and brilliant finish.&quot;[69]
Several writers felt that the novel left much to be desired following Fitzgerald&#39;s previous works and promptly criticized him. Harvey Eagleton of The Dallas Morning News believed the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald&#39;s success: &quot;One finishes Great Gatsby with a feeling of regret, not for the fate of the people in the book, but for Mr. Fitzgerald.&quot;[70] John McClure of The Times-Picayune said that the book was unconvincing, writing, &quot;Even in conception and construction, The Great Gatsby seems a little raw.&quot;[71] Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald&#39;s earlier novels endearing and called the book &quot;a minor performance?... At the moment, its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical.&quot;[72] Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book&#39;s style &quot;painfully forced&quot;, noting that the editors of the paper were &quot;quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of to-day.&quot;[73] The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point: &quot;All the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about.&quot;[22]
Fitzgerald&#39;s goal was to produce a literary work which would truly prove himself as a writer,[74] and Gatsby did not have the commercial success of his two previous novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later.[75] Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character.[75] According to his own ledger, now made available online by University of South Carolina&#39;s Thomas Cooper library, he earned only $2,000 from the book.[76] Although 1926 brought Owen Davis&#39; stage adaption and the Paramount-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye.[22] For several years afterward, the general public believed The Great Gatsby to be nothing more than a nostalgic period piece.[22]
In 1940, Fitzgerald suffered a third and final heart attack, and died believing his work forgotten.[77] His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby as Fitzgerald &quot;at his best&quot;.[78] A strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it and John O&#39;Hara showed the book&#39;s influence.[79] The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson&#39;s edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment, with the general consensus expressing the sentiment that the book was an enduring work of fiction.[22]
In 1942, a group of publishing executives created the Council on Books in Wartime. The Council&#39;s purpose was to distribute paperback books to soldiers fighting in the Second World War. The Great Gatsby was one of these books. The books proved to be &quot;as popular as pin-up girls&quot; among the soldiers, according to the Saturday Evening Post&#39;s contemporary report.[80] 155,000 copies of Gatsby were distributed to soldiers overseas.[81].
By 1944, full-length articles on Fitzgerald&#39;s works were being published, and the following year, &quot;the opinion that Gatsby was merely a period piece had almost entirely disappeared.&quot;[22] This revival was paved by interest shown by literary critic Edmund Wilson, who was Fitzgerald&#39;s friend.[82] In 1951, Arthur Mizener published The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of Fitzgerald.[83] He emphasized The Great Gatsby&#39;s positive reception by literary critics, which may have influenced public opinion and renewed interest in it.[84]
By 1960, the book was steadily selling 50,000 copies per year, and renewed interest led The New York Times editorialist Arthur Mizener to proclaim the novel &quot;a classic of twentieth-century American fiction&quot;.[22] The Great Gatsby has sold over 25 million copies worldwide as of 2013, annually sells an additional 500,000 copies, and is Scribner&#39;s most popular title; in 2013, the e-book alone sold 185,000 copies.[77]
Scribner&#39;s copyright is scheduled to expire in 2020, according to Maureen Corrigan&#39;s book about the making of The Great Gatsby, So We Read On.[85]
The Great Gatsby has resulted in a number of film and television adaptations:
The New York Metropolitan Opera commissioned John Harbison to compose an operatic treatment of the novel to commemorate the 25th anniversary of James Levine&#39;s debut. The work, called The Great Gatsby, premiered on December 20, 1999.[99]</div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button">See more</button></section><!--]--></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright Â© 2014-2024 answer</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
