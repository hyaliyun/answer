eukaryotes,&quot;A cilium (Latin for eyelash;[1] the plural is cilia) is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Cilia are slender protuberances that project from the much larger cell body.[2] Cilium can measure up to 20 m and have a diameter around 0.25 m. [3]
There are two types of cilia: motile cilia and nonmotile, or primary cilia, which typically serve as sensory organelles. In eukaryotes, motile cilia and flagella together make up a group of organelles known as undulipodia.[4] Eukaryotic cilia are structurally identical to eukaryotic flagella, although distinctions are sometimes made according to function and/or length.[5] Biologists have various ideas about how the various flagella may have evolved.


Cilia can be divided into primary and motile forms.[6]
In animals, primary cilia are found on nearly every cell.[2]
In comparison to motile cilia, non-motile (or primary) cilia usually occur one per cell; nearly all mammalian cells have a single non-motile primary cilium. In addition, examples of specialized primary cilia can be found in human sensory organs such as the eye and the nose:
Although the primary cilium was discovered in 1898, it was largely ignored for a century. Only recently has great progress been made in understanding the function of the primary cilium. Until the 1990s, the prevailing view of the primary cilium was that it was merely a vestigial organelle without important function.[2] Recent findings regarding its physiological roles in chemical sensation, signal transduction, and control of cell growth, have led scientists to acknowledge its importance in cell function, with the discovery of its role in diseases not previously recognized to involve the dysgenesis and dysfunction of cilia, such as polycystic kidney disease,[8] congenital heart disease,[9] and an emerging group of genetic ciliopathies.[10] The primary cilium is now known to play an important role in the function of many human organs.[2] The current scientific understanding of primary cilia views them as &quot;sensory cellular antennae that coordinate a large number of cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation.&quot;.[11]
Larger eukaryotes, such as mammals, have motile cilia as well. Motile cilia are usually present on a cell&#39;s surface in large numbers and beat in coordinated waves.[12]
The functioning of motile cilia is strongly dependent on the maintenance of optimal levels of fluid bathing the cilia. Epithelial sodium channels ENaC that are specifically expressed along the entire length of cilia apparently serve as sensors that regulate fluid level surrounding the cilia.[13][15]
Ciliates are microscopic organisms that possess motile cilia exclusively and use them for either locomotion or to simply move liquid over their surface.
Inside cilia and flagella is a microtubule-based cytoskeleton called the axoneme. The axoneme of primary cilia typically has a ring of nine outer microtubule doublets (called a 9+0 axoneme), and the axoneme of a motile cilium has two central microtubule singlets in addition to the nine outer doublets (called a 9+2 axoneme). The axonemal cytoskeleton acts as a scaffolding for various protein complexes and provides binding sites for molecular motor proteins such as kinesin II, that help carry proteins up and down the microtubules.[2][16][17]
The dynein in the axoneme forms bridges between neighbouring microtubule doublets. When ATP activates the motor domain of dynein, it attempts to walk along the adjoining microtubule doublet. This would force the adjacent doublets to slide over one another if not for the presence of Nexin between the microtubule doublets. And thus the force generated by dyenin is instead converted into a bending motion.[18]
Cilia are formed through the process of ciliogenesis. The building blocks of the cilia such as tubulins and other partially assembled axonemal proteins are added to the ciliary tips which point away from the cell body.[19] In most species bi-directional motility called intraflagellar transport (IFT) plays an essential role in moving these building materials from the cell body to the assembly site.[20] IFT also carries the disassembled material to be recycled from the ciliary tip back to the cell body. By regulating the equilibrium between these two IFT processes, the length of cilia can be maintained dynamically. Disassembly of cilia requires the action of the Aurora A kinase .[21]
Exceptions where IFT is not present include Plasmodium falciparum, which is one of the species of Plasmodium that cause malaria in humans. In this parasite, cilia assemble in the cytoplasm.[22]
At the base of the cilium where it attaches to the cell body is the microtubule organizing center, the basal body. Some basal body proteins as CEP164, ODF2 [23] and CEP170,[24] regulate the formation and the stability of the cilium. A transition zone between the basal body and the axoneme &quot;serves as a docking station for intraflagellar transport and motor proteins.&quot;[2]
In effect, the cilium is a nanomachine composed of perhaps over 600 proteins in molecular complexes, many of which also function independently as nanomachines.[11]
The ciliary rootlet is a cytoskeleton-like structure that originates from the basal body at the proximal end of a cilium. It extends proximally toward the cell nucleus. Rootlets are typically 80-100?nm in diameter and contain cross striae distributed at regular intervals of approximately 55-70?nm. According to the Gene Ontology, the following proteins localize to the ciliary rootlet: amyloid precursor protein, rootletin, kinesins (KIF5B, KIF5C, KLC2, KLC3), and presenilins (PSEN1, PSEN2).[25]
Some primary cilia on epithelial cells in eukaryotes act as cellular antennae, providing chemosensation, thermosensation and mechanosensation of the extracellular environment.[26] These cilia then play a role in mediating specific signalling cues, including soluble factors in the external cell environment, a secretory role in which a soluble protein is released to have an effect downstream of the fluid flow, and mediation of fluid flow if the cilia are motile.[26] Some epithelial cells are ciliated, and they commonly exist as a sheet of polarized cells forming a tube or tubule with cilia projecting into the lumen. This sensory and signalling role puts cilia in a central role for maintaining the local cellular environment and may be why ciliary defects cause such a wide range of human diseases.[27]
Ciliary defects can lead to a number of human diseases. Genetic mutations compromising the proper functioning of cilia, ciliopathies, can cause chronic disorders such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), nephronophthisis or Senior-Loken syndrome. In addition, a defect of the primary cilium in the renal tube cells can lead to polycystic kidney disease (PKD). In another genetic disorder called Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), the mutant gene products are the components in the basal body and cilia.[10]
Lack of functional cilia in female Fallopian tubes can cause ectopic pregnancy. A fertilized ovum may not reach the uterus if the cilia are unable to move it there. In such a case, the ovum will implant in the Fallopian tubes, causing a tubal pregnancy, the most common form of ectopic pregnancy.[28]
As noted above, epithelial sodium channels ENaC that are expressed along the length of cilia regulate fluid level surrounding the cilia. Mutations that decrease the activity of ENaC result in multisystem pseudohypoaldosteronism, that is associated with fertility problems.[13] In cystic fibrosis that results from mutations in the chloride channel CFTR, ENaC activity is enhanced leading to a severe reduction of the fluid level that causes complications and infections in the respiratory airways.[15]
Since the flagellum of human sperm is actually a modified cilium, ciliary dysfunction can also be responsible for male infertility.[29]
Of interest, there is an association of primary ciliary dyskinesia with left-right anatomic abnormalities such as situs inversus (a combination of findings known as Kartagener&#39;s syndrome) and other heterotaxic defects. These left-right anatomic abnormalities can also result in congenital heart disease.[30] It has been shown that proper cilial function is responsible for the normal left-right asymmetry in mammals.[31]
Recent findings in genetic research have suggested that a large number of genetic disorders, both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases, that were not previously related in the medical literature, may be, in fact, highly related in the root cause of the widely varying set of medical symptoms that are clinically visible in the disorder. These have been grouped as an emerging class of diseases called ciliopathies. The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary/immotile cilia, organelles which are present in many diverse cellular types throughout the human body. Cilia defects adversely affect numerous critical developmental signaling pathways essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multi-symptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases.[10] Known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney and liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alstrom syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Sensenbrenner syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration.[10][26]ðŸš¨What type of cells have cilia and flagella?</div></div><div class="card" data-v-df454066><div class="question" data-v-df454066>What large body of water is off the texas coast?</div><div class="separator" data-v-df454066></div><div class="answer" data-v-df454066>Gulf of MexicoðŸš¨Corpus Christi (/?k??rp?s ?kr?sti/), colloquially Corpus (Latin: Body of Christ), is a coastal city in the South Texas region of the U.S. state of Texas. The county seat of Nueces County,[6] it also extends into Aransas, Kleberg, and San Patricio Counties. It is 130 miles southeast of San Antonio. Its political boundaries encompass Nueces Bay and Corpus Christi Bay. Its zoned boundaries include small land parcels or water inlets of three neighboring counties.
The city&#39;s population was estimated to be 320,434 in 2014, making it the eighth-most populous city in Texas. The Corpus Christi metropolitan area had an estimated population of 442,600.[1] It is also the hub of the six-county Corpus Christi-Kingsville-Alice Combined Statistical Area, with a 2013 estimated population of 516,793. The Port of Corpus Christi is the fifth-largest in the United States. The region is served by the Corpus Christi International Airport.
The city&#39;s name means Body of Christ in Latin. The name was given to the settlement and surrounding bay by Spanish explorer Alonso lvarez de Pineda in 1519, as he discovered the lush semitropical bay on the Catholic feast day of Corpus Christi. The city&#39;s nickname is &quot;Sparkling City by the Sea&quot;, particularly featured in tourist literature.[7]


Corpus Christi was founded in 1839 by Colonel Henry Lawrence Kinney and William P. Aubrey as Kinney&#39;s Trading Post, or Kinney&#39;s Ranch. It was a small trading post that sold supplies to a Mexican revolutionary army camped about 25?mi (40?km) west.[8] In July 1845, U.S. troops commanded by General Zachary Taylor set up camp there in preparation for war with Mexico, where they remained until March 1846. About a year later, the settlement was named Corpus Christi and was incorporated on 9 September 1852.[9]
The Battle of Corpus Christi was fought between August 12 and August 18, 1862, during the American Civil War. United States Navy forces blockading Texas fought a small land and sea engagement with Confederate forces in and around Corpus Christi Bay and bombarded the city. Union forces defeated Confederate States Navy ships operating in the area, but were repulsed when they landed on the coast.[10]
The Port of Corpus Christi was opened in 1926, and the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station was commissioned in 1941.[8]
The 1919 Storm devastated the city, killing hundreds on September 14. Only three structures survived the storm on North Beach.[11] To protect the city, the seawall was built. The city also suffered damage from Hurricane Celia in 1970 and Hurricane Allen in 1980, but little damage from Hurricane Ike in 2008. The city was impacted in 2017 by Hurricane Harvey.
Corpus Christi is situated on fluvial deposits that are of Holocene Ã¿ Pleistocene age. Although no solidified rock occurs naturally,[14] the Deweyville Formation of sand, silt, clay, and gravel, is locally indurated with calcium carbonate (caliche) deposits. The large, shallow bay makes Corpus Christi an Ideal feeding place for birds and this is one reason why Corpus Christi is known as the &quot;Bird Capital&quot; of North America. Consequently, the San Diego Audubon Society has designated Corpus Christi as &quot;America&#39;s birdiest place.&quot;[15]
According to the United States Census Bureau, Corpus Christi has a total area of 460.2 square miles (1,192.0?km2), of which 154.6?mi2 (400.5?km2, 33.60%) is land and 305.6?mi2 (791.5?km2, 66.40%) is covered by water. Drinking water for the city is supplied by three reservoirs, Lake Corpus Christi, the Choke Canyon Reservoir, and Lake Texana. Through an effective regional partnership with the Nueces River Authority and the Port of Corpus Christi Authority, a 101?mi (163?km) pipeline was built which transports water from Lake Texana to the city&#39;s O.N. Stevens Water Treatment Plant. It was named the Mary Rhodes Pipeline, after the late mayor. A phase 2 of the pipeline is underway to draw water from the Colorado River.[16] All reservoirs are outside the city limits, but Lake Corpus Christi and Choke Canyon Reservoir are managed directly by the public utility of the City of Corpus Christi. To support future water needs, plans are being completed to build a desalinization plant.[17]
Since its founding, the city has annexed nearby lands and waters for growth and development purposes. The original area encompassed several city blocks in present-day downtown Corpus Christi with the majority of city expansion occurring in the 20th century.[18]
The city has a humid subtropical climate, with hot summers and very short, mild winters. In November through February, the weather is the coolest. A noticeable warming trend occurs in March through April. The warmest part of the year is June through September with August being the peak of summer. October in the city is very warm, but not as hot as the summer. Corpus Christi is very windy, with wind speeds often reaching to 25 miles per hour (40?km/h; 11?m/s) with gusts reaching more than 35 miles per hour (56?km/h; 16?m/s). The citys record high temperature is 109?F (42.8?C), on September 5, 2000, and the hottest month August 2012 with an average of 88.3?F or 31.3?C. Average night-time winter lows in January, the coldest month, are a little less than 50?F or 10?C and its record low is 11?F or ?11.7?C on February 12, 1899, and the coldest maximum 26?F or ?3.3?C on five occasions, the most recent being on January 30, 1951.[nb 1] Winter and early spring is generally dry, and average monthly precipitation is highest in September, when the threat from hurricanes and other tropical weather systems is greatest. The coolest month on record has been February 1905, with a mean of 45.6?F or 7.6?C. In December 2004, the city experienced snowfall on Christmas Eve, the citys largest recorded snowstorm at 4.4 inches (0.11?m). The snow melted the day after Christmas. Because of the uniqueness of the event, three separate books document the event, Snow, More Snow, and More Snow for Kids, all with the theme of the South Texas Christmas miracle.[19]
Between 1981 and 2010, Corpus Christi averaged 31.73 inches or 805.9 millimetres of rainfall; however, long periods with very little rainfall are normal, and hurricanes can frequently produce daily falls of over 4 inches or 101.6 millimetres. The wettest day on record is July 2, 2007, with 9.86 inches or 250.4 millimetres, while the wettest month on record is September 1967, with 20.33 inches or 516.4 millimetres, including four days with over 3 inches or 76.2 millimetres. Eight months with not even a trace of rainfall have happened, of which the most recent was May 1998, and 21 with merely a trace. The longest spell without measurable rainfall in Corpus Christi has been 55 days from June 23 to August 17 (inclusive) of 1895, and from June 1 to July 25 of 1915, while easily the driest calendar year has been 1917, with a mere 5.38 inches or 136.7 millimetres. The two wettest calendar years have been 1888 with 48.16 inches or 1,223.3 millimetres and 1991 with 48.07 inches or 1,221.0 millimetres, although from August 1967 to July 1968, 59.09 inches or 1,500.9 millimetres fell, and for the 12 months ending January 1918, only 5.22 inches or 132.6 millimetres.
Hurricanes rarely hit the city, and have been destructive, like the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane, and Hurricane Harvey in 2017.[20]
At the 2010 Census, 305,215 people resided in Corpus Christi, a 10.0% increase since 2000.[25]
In 2012, Corpus Christi was ranked as the second least literate city in the U.S. in a study by Central Connecticut State University. [26] However, this study has been heavily criticized for its methodology and bias in favor of the Northeastern states in the US.

About 23.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.75 and the average family size was 3.27.
In the city, the population was distributed as 28.1% under the age of 18, 10.6% from 18 to 24, 29.2% from 25 to 44, 21.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.2 males.

The majority of the population is employed in the services, wholesale and retail trades, and government sectors. Corpus Christi has an unemployment rate of 5.6% as of November 2016.[27]
The Port of Corpus Christi, which is the fifth-largest U.S. port[28] and deepest inshore port on the Gulf of Mexico, handles mostly oil and agricultural products. Much of the local economy is driven by tourism and the oil and petrochemicals industry. In 2005, the port was ranked as the 47th-largest in the world by cargo tonnage.
Corpus Christi is home to Naval Air Station Corpus Christi providing 6,200 civilian jobs to the local economy, making it the single largest employer in the city. Corpus Christi Army Depot, located on NAS Corpus Christi, is the largest helicopter repair facility in the world.[9] Additionally located on NAS Corpus Christi is the United States Coast Guard Sector/Air Station Corpus Christi.
Corpus Christi is the original home of the headquarters of Whataburger, a fast-food restaurant operator and franchiser with 650 stores in 10 states and Mexico; however, the company relocated its headquarters to San Antonio in 2009. Other large employers include CHRISTUS Spohn Health System at 5,400 local employees, the Corpus Christi Independent School District with 5,178, H-E-B at 5,000, and Bay Ltd. at 2,100.[29] Other companies based in Corpus Christi include Stripes Convenience Stores and AEP Texas.[30][31]
Corpus Christi became the first major city to offer citywide free wi-fi in April 2005 [32] to allow remote meter reading after a meter reader was attacked by a dog. In 2007, the network was purchased by Earthlink for $5.5 million, and stopped being a free service on May 31, 2007.[33]
Various sections of Corpus Christi maintain distinct senses of identity and community from the city proper, especially the Calallen and Flour Bluff areas. Clarkwood and Annaville have less prominent senses of identity, but the distinction remains. These areas are sometimes mistakenly believed to be separate municipalities.[citation needed]
The city has many demographic groups, ethnicities, and subcultures, each giving it a distinct flavor: the defense bases and the people who work there, the large Hispanic community, the oil-related professionals and workers, the cowboy culture, and the surfers.
In 2015, Men&#39;s Health magazine ranked Corpus Christi as the fattest city in the United States, renaming it &quot;Corpulent Christi&quot;.[34] Obesity and diabetes rank second and third in the nation, which is culturally related to the Hispanic population. [35]
The city is home to a number of popular destinations for both tourists and residents. The official visitor and tourism information organization is the Corpus Christi Convention and Visitors Bureau. Some of the most visited attractions are located on North Beach, where the Texas State Aquarium and the USS Lexington Museum on the Bay are located.[36]
The USS Lexington was also part of the set for the 2000 film Pearl Harbor. Corpus Christi&#39;s museum district is located near the USS Lexington. Some attractions located in the museum district are the Museum of Asian Cultures, the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History, the South Texas Institute for the Arts, and the Harbor Playhouse Theatre, one of the oldest continually operating community theatres in Texas. Heritage Park is also in the museum district, where a number of older restored houses can be found. The downtown area, of which the museum district is a part, is home to skyscrapers such as One Shoreline Plaza, company offices, various shops, a popular center of marinas, and Mirador de la Flor. Downtown also is home of the Texas Surf Museum, which explores the history of surfing and focuses on surf culture along Texas&#39; 367-mile (591?km) coast, as well as K Space Contemporary, a nonprofit art organization promoting and presenting local, regional, and national contemporary art.
The Corpus Christi Botanical Gardens and Nature Center, also located in the city, hosts gardening programs from time to time. On Oso Bay near the Pharaoh Valley subdivision is the Hans and Pat Suter Wildlife Refuge, known for seabird-watching. The nearby Pharaohs golf course also serves as a haven for coastal and migratory birds.
Directly east of Corpus Christi are Padre Island and Mustang Island, home to various municipal, state, and national parks, most notably the Padre Island National Seashore. The city is also near King Ranch, one of the world&#39;s largest ranches, upon which the movie Giant was based.
The city also celebrates the annual Buccaneer Days Carnival, which is typically held downtown.
South Padre Island Drive (locally abbreviated as &quot;S.P.I.D.&quot;, with the letters pronounced individually), is the city&#39;s main retail corridor, with two shopping malls, La Palmera (formerly Padre Staples Mall), and Sunrise Mall. Also, a number of other large shopping centers, small strip centers, and restaurants can be found throughout the city.
Corpus Christi also is the home of Midget Ocean Racing Fleet, also known as MORF, which promotes sailing in the Coastal Bend. The Wednesday night races held by MORF are the longest-running weekly races in the United States.
Corpus Christi has professional sports to offer residents and visitors. The city is home to the Corpus Christi IceRays of the North American Hockey League and the Corpus Christi Hooks are the AA minor league baseball club for the Houston Astros which plays in the Texas League.
Year round NCAA Division I collegiate athletics may be found at Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi as the Islanders compete in 14 mens and womens sports as a member of the Southland Conference.
Sailing races are held weekly off downtown&#39;s T-heads every Wednesday, where spectators watch vessels competing during sunset. Additionally, Corpus Christi is also home to the Corpus Christi Rugby Football Club, which is a member of the Texas Rugby Union, an affiliate of the Western Rugby Union and of the United States Rugby Football Union.
The city&#39;s location beside Corpus Christi Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and Laguna Madre provides opportunities for water sports and nature tourism. Waterfowl hunting is available in the region for duck, geese, coot, and teal. White-winged dove and mourning dove are also hunted on private leases. The brushland inland from Corpus Christi is also ideal for hunting feral hogs and white-tailed deer.
Fishing is a popular recreational activity in Corpus Christi. Popular fishing activities include fishing from various piers around Corpus Christi Bay, wade fishing in Oso Bay, and fishing from the Gulf of Mexico at Packery Channel or at Bob Hall Pier.
The city has one of the highest average wind speeds of coastal cities in North America.[37] Combined with the Bay Front area along Ocean Drive, making the city an important destination for wind sports such as kite boarding, wind surfing, kite flying, and sailing. In 1990, Corpus Christi hosted the Windsurfing World Championships.
The Corpus Christi Skate Park opened on February 17, 2007. It is located in Cole Park on the shoreline of the Corpus Christi Bay near downtown. The 12,000-square-foot (1,100?m2) concrete park includes a skating bowl and a street course with stairs, railings, and flat surfaces.
Being a coastal city, Corpus Christi is a good spot for seabird watching. Popular spots include Blucher Park in downtown, the Hans and Pat Suter Wildlife Refuge along Oso Bay, Hazel Bazemore County Park along the Nueces River in Calallen, and the South Texas Botanic Garden and Nature Center along the Oso Creek.[38]
In 1852, the City of Corpus Christi was incorporated. Texas&#39; 31st Legislature chartered the city as a political and corporate municipal entity in 1909. By ordinance, the city possesses power to &quot;fix, alter and extend its boundaries.&quot;[39]
Corpus Christi is under a council-manager municipal government. The elected city council is the primary authority in municipal matters such as enacting local legislation, determining policies, and appointing the city manager. Together, the city council and city manager execute laws and administer the municipal government.[39] Organized by governmental sectors of city council, city management, city secretary, and several city departments, Corpus Christi is seated in Nueces County. The city council currently consists of these elected members:
Corpus Christi City Manager Margie C. Rose was appointed in 2016, and works alongside Assistant City Manager Mark Van Vleck (public works and utilities) and Jay Ellington (Interim Ã¿ safety, health, and neighborhoods).The city&#39;s Intergovernmental Relations department is under the direction of Tom Tagliabue. Appointed by the city council, Rebecca L. Huerta serves as the city secretary.[41]
The Corpus Christi City Charter was adopted by public referendum in 1987, with amendments to the entire charter conducted January 19, 1991, and April 3, 1993. Further revisions to the charter were conducted on November 2, 2004, November 7, 2006, and November 8, 2016.[42] The charter consists of 10 articles and 41 sections regarding stipulations of home rule government, city council and city manager procedures, administration, planning, boards and commissions, etc. The Code of Ordinances of Corpus Christi was codified through Ordinance No. 028493, and adopted Feb. 23, 2010.[43]

Corpus Christi is home to several institutions of higher learning: Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi, Del Mar College, Saint Leo University-Corpus Christi and numerous vocational schools, including Southern Careers Institute, South Texas Vo-Tech, Career Centers of Texas-Corpus Christi, and Vogue Cosmetology School. The city is also home to the South Texas School of Christian Studies located on Ward Island alongside Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi. The school serves as an extension campus on the undergraduate level for Hardin Simmons University and on the graduate level for Logsdon Seminary of Hardin-Simmons.
Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi is a component of the Texas A&amp;M University System. It was formerly known as Corpus Christi State University, Texas A&amp;I University at Corpus Christi, and the University of Corpus Christi.
Saint Leo University-Corpus Christi Education Center is located at Corpus Christi&#39;s Naval Air Station.
Del Mar College is a local community college begun in the 1940s at a location behind Wynn Seale Jr. High School. The main campus began with the administration building, which was constructed after World War II on Del Mar. The college grew to encompass a good portion of a residential addition called Southmoreland built from the Bohemian farm lands in the late 1930s. Del Mar now includes a west campus located in the area of Corpus Christi that once was Cliff Maus Airport.
Southern Careers Institute offers career training at two Corpus Christi locations, primarily in the medical, business, and cosmetology fields.
In 2015, WalletHub ranked Corpus Christi near the bottom, 138 out of 150 cities in America, for its low educational level and low income opportunities.[48] In order to improve literacy levels in the city, there has been a multi-year effort to promote reading through annual literacy festivals. Started by First Lady Laura Bush and the Texas Book Festival, a series of book festivals are held each spring. This year&#39;s festival features award-winning author Rosemary Wells [49] and revolves around the concept that &quot;literacy is the foundation to a child&#39;s academic success.&quot;
Six school districts provide primary and secondary education for area residents: Corpus Christi Independent School District, Calallen ISD, Flour Bluff ISD, Tuloso-Midway ISD, West Oso ISD, and London ISD.

Corpus Christi is served by Corpus Christi International Airport and Interstate 37. Interstate 69E/U.S. Highway 77 connects the city to Brownsville and Victoria. Texas State Highway 44 is a main thoroughfare that connects Corpus Christi to Laredo and the western part of South Texas by way of Interstate 69W/U.S. Highway 59, Interstate 35, and U.S. Highway 83. The inner-city public transportation is provided by Corpus Christi Regional Transportation Authority with its 28 bus routes. Corpus Christi once had a streetcar system functioning from 1910 to 1931 and a railway station (passenger service ended in 1965). Despite the convenience of a large harbor, the city does not have a passenger port. Plans to bring a cruise service are pending.
The city is accessed by two major bridges, the Harbor Bridge (US 181) and the John F. Kennedy Causeway (PR 22). Both bridges are maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation.
Freight service from San Antonio to Corpus Christi is provided by the Union Pacific Railroad, but the original line, both freight and passenger, was the San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad, which operated to Corpus Christi from 1913 to 1956.[52] Then the SAU&amp;G, or &quot;The Sausage&quot;, as it was commonly called, was merged into the Missouri Pacific Railroad. It was subsequently procured by the Union Pacific.[53]
Corpus Christi keeps a thriving and active relationship with these sister cities:[54]</div></div><div class="card" data-v-df454066><div class="question" data-v-df454066>What is the story told by the bayeux tapestry?</div><div class="separator" data-v-df454066></div><div class="answer" data-v-df454066>the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England concerning William, Duke of Normandy, and Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England, and culminating in the Battle of Hastings.ðŸš¨The Bayeux Tapestry or Bayeux Embroidery[1][2][3] (English: /ba??j??r/ or US: /b??ju?/,/b??j?/ ,/be??ju?/; French: Tapisserie de Bayeux, IPA:?[tapis?i d? baj?], or La telle du conquest; Latin: Tapete Baiocense) is an embroidered cloth nearly 70 metres (230?ft) long and 50 centimetres (20?in) tall, which depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England concerning William, Duke of Normandy, and Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England, and culminating in the Battle of Hastings.
According to Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry:
The Bayeux tapestry is one of the supreme achievements of the Norman Romanesque?.... Its survival almost intact over nine centuries is little short of miraculous?... Its exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit combine to make it endlessly fascinating.[4]
The tapestry consists of some fifty scenes with Latin tituli, embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns. It is likely that it was commissioned by Bishop Odo, William&#39;s half-brother, and made in Englandnot Bayeuxin the 1070s. In 1729 the hanging was rediscovered by scholars at a time when it was being displayed annually in Bayeux Cathedral. The tapestry is now exhibited at the Muse de la Tapisserie de Bayeux in Bayeux, Normandy, France (491628N 04201W? / ?49.2744N 0.7003W? / 49.2744; -0.7003).
The designs on the Bayeux Tapestry are embroidered rather than woven, so that it is not technically a tapestry.[5] Nevertheless, it has always been called a tapestry until recent years, when the more correct name &quot;Bayeux Embroidery&quot; has gained ground among art historians. The tapestry can be seen as the final and best known work of Anglo-Saxon art, and though made after the Conquest was both made in England and firmly in an Anglo-Saxon tradition, points now accepted by French art historians.[6] Such tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in England, though at 0.5 by 68.38 metres (1.6 by 224.3?ft, and apparently incomplete) the Bayeux Tapestry is exceptionally large. Only the figures and decoration are embroidered, on a background left plain, which shows the subject very clearly and was necessary to cover large areas.


The earliest known written reference to the tapestry is a 1476 inventory of Bayeux Cathedral,[7] but its origins have been the subject of much speculation and controversy.
French legend maintained the tapestry was commissioned and created by Queen Matilda, William the Conqueror&#39;s wife, and her ladies-in-waiting. Indeed, in France it is occasionally known as &quot;La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde&quot; (Tapestry of Queen Matilda). However, scholarly analysis[8] in the 20th century concluded it was probably commissioned by William&#39;s half-brother, Bishop Odo, who, after the Conquest, became Earl of Kent and, when William was absent in Normandy, regent of England.
The reasons for the Odo commission theory include: 1) three of the bishop&#39;s followers mentioned in the Domesday Book appear on the tapestry; 2) it was found in Bayeux Cathedral, built by Odo; and 3) it may have been commissioned at the same time as the cathedral&#39;s construction in the 1070s, possibly completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral&#39;s dedication.
Assuming Odo commissioned the tapestry, it was probably designed and constructed in England by Anglo-Saxon artists (Odo&#39;s main power base being by then in Kent); the Latin text contains hints of Anglo-Saxon; other embroideries originate from England at this time; and the vegetable dyes can be found in cloth traditionally woven there.[9][10][11] Howard B. Clarke has proposed that the designer of the tapestry was Scolland, the abbot of St Augustine&#39;s Abbey in Canterbury, because of his previous position as head of the scriptorium at Mont Saint-Michel (famed for its illumination), his travels to Trajan&#39;s Column, and his connections to Wadard and Vital, two individuals identified in the tapestry.[12][13] The actual physical work of stitching was most likely undertaken by female needle workers. Anglo-Saxon needlework of the more detailed type known as Opus Anglicanum was famous across Europe. It was perhaps commissioned for display in the hall of his palace and then bequeathed to the cathedral he built, following the pattern of the documented but lost hanging of Byrhtnoth.[14]
Alternative theories exist. Carola Hicks has suggested it could possibly have been commissioned by Edith of Wessex.[15] Wolfgang Grape has challenged the consensus that the embroidery is Anglo-Saxon, distinguishing between Anglo-Saxon and other Northern European techniques;[16] Medieval material authority Elizabeth Coatsworth[17] contradicted this: &quot;The attempt to distinguish Anglo-Saxon from other Northern European embroideries before 1100 on the grounds of technique cannot be upheld on the basis of present knowledge.&quot;[18] George Beech suggests the tapestry was executed at the Abbey of St. Florent in the Loire Valley, and says the detailed depiction of the Breton campaign argues for additional sources in France.[19] Andrew Bridgeford has suggested that the tapestry was actually of English design and encoded with secret messages meant to undermine Norman rule.[20]
In common with other embroidered hangings of the early medieval period, this piece is conventionally referred to as a &quot;tapestry&quot;, although it is not a true tapestry in which the design is woven into the cloth; it is in fact an embroidery.
The Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in crewel (wool yarn) on a tabby-woven linen ground 68.38 metres long and 0.5 metres wide (224.3?ft G?1.6?ft) and using two methods of stitching: outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures.[10][11] Nine linen panels, between fourteen and three metres in length, were sewn together after each was embroidered and the joins were disguised with subsequent embroidery.[21] At the first join (start of scene 14) the borders do not line up properly but the technique was improved so that the later joins are practically invisible.[21] The design involved a broad central zone with narrow decorative borders top and bottom.[21] By inspecting the woollen threads behind the linen it is apparent all these aspects were embroidered together at a session and the awkward placing of the tituli is not due to them being added later.[21] Later generations have patched the hanging in numerous places and some of the embroidery (especially in the final scene) has been reworked.[21] The tapestry may well have maintained much of its original appearanceit now compares closely with a careful drawing made in 1730.[21]
The main yarn colours are terracotta or russet, blue-green, dull gold, olive green, and blue, with small amounts of dark blue or black and sage green. Later repairs are worked in light yellow, orange, and light greens.[10] Laid yarns are couched in place with yarn of the same or contrasting colour.
The tapestry&#39;s central zone contains most of the action, which sometimes overflows into the borders either for dramatic effect or because depictions would otherwise be very cramped (for example at Edward&#39;s death scene). Events take place in a long series of scenes which are generally separated by highly stylised trees. However, the trees are not placed consistently and the greatest scene shift, between Harold&#39;s audience with Edward after his return to England and Edward&#39;s burial scene, is not marked in any way at all.[22]
The tituli are normally in the central zone but occasionally use the top border. The borders are otherwise mostly purely decorative and only sometimes does the decoration complement the action in the central zone. The decoration consists of birds, beasts, fish and scenes from fables, agriculture and hunting. There are frequent oblique bands separating the vignettes. There are nude figures, some of corpses from battle, others of a ribald nature.[22] A harrow, a newly invented implement, is depicted (scene 10) and this is the earliest known depiction. The picture of Halley&#39;s Comet, which appears in the upper border (scene 32), is the first known picture of this comet.[22]
The end of the tapestry has been missing from time immemorial and the final titulus &quot;Et fuga verterunt Angli&quot; (&quot;and the English left fleeing&quot;) is said to be &quot;entirely spurious&quot;, added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment.[22] Musset speculates the hanging was originally about 1.5 metres longer.[22] At the last section still remaining the embroidery has been almost completely restored but this seems to have been done with at least some regard to the original stitching.[22] The stylised tree is quite unlike any other tree in the tapestry.[22] The start of the tapestry has also been restored but to a much lesser extent.[22]
In 1724 a linen backing cloth was sewn on comparatively crudely and, in around the year 1800, large ink numerals were written on the backing which broadly enumerate each scene and which are still commonly used for reference.[22]
In a series of pictures supported by a written commentary the tapestry tells the story of the events of 1064Ã¿1066 culminating in the Battle of Hastings. The two main protagonists are Harold Godwinson, recently crowned King of England, leading the Anglo-Saxon English, and William, Duke of Normandy, leading a mainly Norman army, sometimes called the companions of William the Conqueror.[22]
William was the illegitimate son of Robert the Magnificent, Duke of Normandy, and Herleva (or Arlette), a tanner&#39;s daughter. William became Duke of Normandy at the age of seven and was in control of Normandy by the age of nineteen. His half brother was Bishop Odo of Bayeux.
King Edward the Confessor, king of England and about sixty years old at the time the tapestry starts its narration, had no children or any clear successor. Edward&#39;s mother, Emma of Normandy, was William&#39;s great aunt. At that time succession to the English throne was not by primogeniture but was decided jointly by the king and by an assembly of nobility, the Witenagemot.
Harold Godwinson, earl of Wessex and the most powerful noble in England, was Edward&#39;s brother-in-law. The Norman chronicler William of Poitiers[23] reported that Edward had previously determined that William would succeed him on the throne, and Harold had sworn to honour this, and yet later that Harold had claimed Edward, on his deathbed, had made him heir over William. However, other sources dispute this claim.
The tapestry begins with a panel of Edward the Confessor sending Harold to Normandy.(scene 1) Later Norman sources say that the mission was for Harold to pledge loyalty to William but the tapestry does not suggest any specific purpose.[21] By mischance, Harold arrives at the wrong location in France and is taken prisoner by Guy, Count of Ponthieu.(scene 7) After exchanges of messages borne by mounted messengers, Harold is released to William who then invites Harold to come on a campaign against Conan II, Duke of Brittany. On the way, just outside the monastery of Mont Saint-Michel, the army become mired in quicksand and Harold saves two Norman soldiers.(scene 17) William&#39;s army chases Conan from Dol de Bretagne to Rennes, and Conan finally surrenders at Dinan.(scene 20) William gives Harold arms and armour (possibly knighting him) and Harold takes an oath on saintly relics.(scene 23) Although the writing on the tapestry explicitly states an oath is taken there is no clue as to what is being promised.[21]
Harold leaves for home and meets again with the old king Edward, who appears to be remonstrating with him.(scene 25) Harold is in a somewhat submissive posture and seems to be in disgrace.[21] However, possibly deliberately, the king&#39;s intentions are not made clear.[21] The scene then shifts by about one year to when Edward has become mortally ill and the tapestry strongly suggests that, on his deathbed, he bequeaths the crown to Harold.[note 1][22] What is probably the coronation ceremony[note 2] is attended by Stigand, whose position as Archbishop of Canterbury was controversial.[22](scene 31) Stigand is performing a liturgical function, possibly not the crowning itself.[22] The tapestry labels the celebrant as &quot;Stigant Archieps&quot; (Stigand the archbishop) although by that time he had been excommunicated by the papacy who considered his appointment unlawful.[21]
A star with a streaming tail then appears: Halley&#39;s Comet.[note 3] Comets, in the beliefs of the Middle Ages, were a bad omen. At this point the lower border of the tapestry shows a fleet of ghost-like ships thus hinting at a future invasion.[21](scene 33) The news of Harold&#39;s coronation is taken to Normandy, whereupon we are told that William is ordering a fleet of ships to be built although it is Bishop Odo shown issuing the instructions.(scene 35) The invaders reach England, and land unopposed. William orders his men to find food, and a meal is cooked.(scene 43) A house is burnt, which may indicate some ravaging of the local countryside on the part of the invaders.(scene 47) News is brought to William.[note 4] The Normans build a motte and bailey at Hastings to defend their position. Messengers are sent between the two armies, and William makes a speech to prepare his army for battle.(scene 51)
The Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 less than three weeks after the Battle of Stamford Bridge but the tapestry does not provide this context. The English fight on foot behind a shield wall, whilst the Normans are on horses.[note 5] Two fallen knights are named as Leofwine and Gyrth, Harold&#39;s brothers, but both armies are shown fighting bravely.[21] Bishop Odo brandishes his baton or mace and rallies the Norman troops in battle.(scene 54)[note 6][21] To reassure his knights that he is still alive and well, William raises his helmet to show his face.[22] The battle becomes very bloody with troops being slaughtered and dismembered corpses littering the ground. King Harold is killed.(scene 57) This scene can be interpreted in different ways, as the name &quot;Harold&quot; appears above a number of knights, making it difficult to identify which character is Harold. The final remaining scene shows unarmoured English troops fleeing the battlefield. The last part of the tapestry is missing but it is thought that the story contained only one additional scene.[21]
Tituli are included in many scenes to point out names of people and places or to explain briefly the event being depicted.[22] The text is in Latin but at times the style of words and spelling shows an English influence.[22] A dark blue wool, almost black, is mostly used but towards the end of the tapestry other colours are used, sometimes for each word and other times for each letter.[22] The complete text and English translation are displayed beside images of each scene at Bayeux Tapestry tituli.
The first reference to the tapestry is from 1476 when it was listed in an inventory of the treasures of Bayeux Cathedral. It survived the sack of Bayeux by the Huguenots in 1562; and the next certain reference is from 1724.[22] Antoine Lancelot sent a report to the Acadmie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres concerning a sketch he had received about a work concerning William the Conqueror. He had no idea whether the original was a sculpture or painting though he mooted it could be a tapestry.[24] Despite his further enquiries he discovered no more.
However, the Benedictine scholar Bernard de Montfaucon made more successful investigations and found that the sketch was of a small portion of a tapestry preserved at Bayeux Cathedral. In 1729 and 1730 he published drawings and a detailed description of the complete work in the first two volumes of his Les Monuments de la Monarchie fran?aise. The drawings were by Antoine Beno?t, one of the ablest draughtsmen of that time.[24]
The tapestry was first briefly noted in English in 1743 by William Stukeley, in his Palaeographia Britannica.[25] The first detailed account in English was written by Smart Lethieullier, who was living in Paris in 1732Ã¿3, and was acquainted with Lancelot and de Montfaucon: it was not published, however, until 1767, as an appendix to Andrew Ducarel&#39;s Anglo-Norman Antiquities.[26]
During the French Revolution, in 1792, the tapestry was confiscated as public property to be used for covering military wagons.[22] It was rescued from a wagon by a local lawyer who stored it in his house until the troubles were over, when he sent it to the city administrators for safekeeping.[24] After the Terror the Fine Arts Commission, set up to safeguard national treasures, in 1803 required it to be removed to Paris for display at the Muse Napolon.[24] When Napoleon abandoned his planned invasion of Britain its propaganda value was lost and it was returned to Bayeux where the council displayed it on a winding apparatus of two cylinders.[24] Despite scholars&#39; concern that the tapestry was becoming damaged the council refused to return it to the Cathedral.[24]
In 1816 the Society of Antiquaries of London commissioned its historical draughtsman, Charles Stothard, to visit Bayeux to make an accurate hand-coloured facsimile of the tapestry. His drawings were subsequently engraved by James Basire jr., and published by the Society in 1819Ã¿23.[27] Stothard&#39;s images are still of value as a record of the tapestry as it was before 19th-century restoration.
By 1842 the tapestry was displayed in a special-purpose room in the Bibliothque Publique. It required special storage in 1870 with the threatened invasion of Normandy in the Franco-Prussian War and again in 1939Ã¿1944 by the Ahnenerbe during the German Occupation of France and the Normandy landings. On 27 June 1944 the Gestapo took the tapestry to the Louvre and on 18 August, three days before the Wehrmacht withdrew from Paris, Himmler sent a message (intercepted by Bletchley Park) ordering it to be taken to &quot;a place of safety&quot;, thought to be Berlin.[21] It was only on 22 August that the SS attempted to take possession of the tapestry by which time the Louvre was again in French hands.[21] After the liberation of Paris, on 25 August, the tapestry was again put on public display in the Louvre, and in 1945 it was returned to Bayeux[24] where it is exhibited at the Muse de la Tapisserie de Bayeux.
The inventory listing of 1476 shows that the tapestry was being hung annually in Bayeux Cathedral for the week of the Feast of St. John the Baptist; and this was still the case in 1728, although by that time the purpose was merely to air the hanging, which was otherwise stored in a chest.[21] Clearly, the work was being well cared for. In the eighteenth century the artistry was regarded as crude or even barbarousred and yellow multi-coloured horses upset some critics. It was thought to be unfinished because the linen was not covered with embroidery.[21] However, its exhibition in the Louvre in 1797 caused a sensation, with Le Moniteur, which normally dealt with foreign affairs, reporting on it on its first two pages.[21] It inspired a popular musical, La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde. It was because the tapestry was regarded as an antiquity rather than a work of art that in 1804 it was returned to Bayeux, where in 1823 one commentator, A. L. Lchaud d&#39;Anisy, reported that &quot;there is a sort of purity in its primitive forms, especially considering the state of the arts in the eleventh century&quot;.[21]
The tapestry was becoming a tourist attraction, with Robert Southey complaining of the need to queue to see the work.[note 7] In the 1843 Hand-book for Travellers in France by John Murray III, a visit was included on &quot;Recommended Route 26 (Caen to Cherbourg via Bayeux)&quot;, and this guidebook led John Ruskin to go there; he would describe the tapestry as &quot;the most interesting thing in its way conceivable&quot;. Charles Dickens, however, was not impressed: &quot;It is certainly the work of amateurs; very feeble amateurs at the beginning and very heedless some of them too.&quot;[21]
During the Second World War Heinrich Himmler coveted the work, regarding it as &quot;important for our glorious and cultured Germanic history&quot;.[21]
The tapestry contains several mysteries:
The Bayeux Tapestry was probably commissioned by the House of Normandy and essentially depicts a Norman viewpoint. However, Harold is shown as brave and his soldiers are not belittled. Throughout, William is described as &quot;dux&quot; (duke) whereas Harold, also called dux up to his coronation, is subsequently called &quot;rex&quot; (king).[21] The fact that the narrative extensively covers Harold&#39;s activities in Normandy (in 1064) indicates that the intention was to show a strong relationship between that expedition and the Norman Conquest starting two years later. It is for this reason that the tapestry is generally seen by modern scholars as an apologia for the Norman Conquest.
The tapestry&#39;s narration seems to place stress on Harold&#39;s oath to William although its rationale is not made clear.[22] Norman sources claimed that the English succession was being pledged to William but English sources gave varied accounts.[22] Today it is thought the Norman sources are to be preferred.[30] Both the tapestry and Norman sources[31] named Stigand, the excommunicated Archbishop of Canterbury, as the man who crowned Harold, possibly to discredit Harold&#39;s kingship; English sources[32] suggested that he was crowned by Ealdred, Archbishop of York and favoured by the papacy, making Harold&#39;s position as legitimate king more secure. Contemporary scholarship has not decided the matter although it is generally thought Ealdred performed the coronation.[33][34]
While political propaganda or personal emphasis may have somewhat distorted the historical accuracy of the story, the Bayeux tapestry presents a unique visual document of medieval arms, apparel, and other objects unlike any other artifact surviving from this period. There is no attempt at continuity between scenes either for individuals&#39; appearance or clothing. The knights carry shields, but show no system of hereditary coats of armsthe beginnings of modern heraldic structure were in place, but would not become standard until the middle of the 12th century.[22] It has been noted that the warriors are depicted fighting with bare hands, while other sources indicate the general use of gloves in battle and hunt.
Tapestry fragments have been found in Scandinavia dating from the ninth century and it is thought that Norman and Anglo-Saxon embroidery developed from this sort of work. Examples are to be found in the grave goods of the Oseberg ship and the ?verhogdal tapestries.[22]
A monastic text from Ely, the Liber Eliensis, mentions a woven narrative wall-hanging commemorating the deeds of Byrhtnoth, killed in 991. Wall-hangings were common by the tenth century with English and Norman texts particularly commending the skill of Anglo-Saxon seamstresses. Mural paintings imitating draperies still exist in France and Italy and there are twelfth century mentions of other wall-hangings in Normandy and France. A poem by Baldric of Dol might even be describing the Bayeux Tapestry itself.[22] The Bayeux Tapestry was therefore not unique at the time it was created: rather it is remarkable for being the sole surviving example of medieval narrative needlework.[35]
There are a number of replicas of the Bayeux Tapestry in existence. Through the collaboration of William Morris with textile manufacturer Thomas Wardle, Wardle&#39;s wife Elizabeth, who was an accomplished seamstress, embarked on creating a reproduction in 1885.[21] She organised some 37 women in her Leek School of Art Embroidery[note 8] to collaborate working from a full-scale water-colour facsimile drawing provided by the South Kensington Museum. The full-size replica was finished in 1886 and is now exhibited in the Museum of Reading in Reading, Berkshire, England.[36] The naked figure in the original tapestry (in the border below the ?lfgyva figure) is depicted wearing a brief garment because the drawing which was worked from was similarly bowdlerised.[21]
Ray Dugan of University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, completed a stitched replica in 1996.[37] Since its completion, it has been displayed in various museums and galleries in Canada and the United States.[38]
In 2000, the Danish-based Bayeux Group, part of the Viking Group Lindholm H?je, began making an accurate replica of the Bayeux Tapestry, using the original sewing techniques.[39] The replica was completed in June 2014 and went on permanent exhibition at B?rglum Abbey in May 2015.[40]
Dr. E. D. Wheeler, former judge and former dean at Oglethorpe University, commissioned a hand-painted, full-size replica of the Bayeux Tapestry and donated it to the University of West Georgia in Carrollton in 1994. In 2014, the replica was acquired by the University of North Georgia in Dahlonega.
An approximately half scale mosaic version of the Bayeux Tapestry was formerly on display at Geraldine, New Zealand.[41] It was made up of 1.5 million 7?mm2 pieces of spring steel Ã¿ off-cuts from patterning disks of knitting machines Ã¿ and was created by Michael Linton over a period of twenty years from 1979. The work was in 32 sections, and included a hypothetical reconstruction of the missing final section leading up to William the Conqueror&#39;s coronation at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day, 1066.[42]
Jason Welch, a woodcarver from North Creake, Norfolk, England, created a replica of the Tapestry between 2011 and 2014 in carved and painted wooden relief on 25 five-foot planks. He undertook the project to help cope with the grief of losing his 16-year-old son.[43]
Other modern artists have attempted to complete the work by creating panels depicting subsequent events up to William&#39;s coronation, though the actual content of the missing panels is unknown. In 1997, the embroidery artist Jan Messent completed a reconstruction showing William accepting the surrender of English nobles at Berkhamsted (Beorcham), Hertfordshire, and his coronation.[44][45][46] In early 2013, 416 residents of Alderney in the Channel Islands finished a continuation including William&#39;s coronation and the building of the Tower of London.[47]
Because it resembles a modern comic strip or movie storyboard, is widely recognised, and is so distinctive in its artistic style, the Bayeux Tapestry has frequently been used or reimagined in a variety of different popular culture contexts. George Wingfield Digby wrote in 1957:
It was designed to tell a story to a largely illiterate public; it is like a strip cartoon, racy, emphatic, colourful, with a good deal of blood and thunder and some ribaldry.[48]
It has been cited by Scott McCloud in Understanding Comics as an example of early narrative art;[49] and Bryan Talbot, a British comic book artist, has called it &quot;the first known British comic strip&quot;.[50]
It has inspired many modern political and other cartoons, including:
The tapestry has also inspired modern embroideries, notably:
A number of films have used sections of the tapestry in their opening credits or closing titles, including Disney&#39;s Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Anthony Mann&#39;s El Cid, Zeffirelli&#39;s Hamlet, Frank Cassenti&#39;s La Chanson de Roland, Kevin Reynolds&#39; Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and Richard Fleischer&#39;s The Vikings.[54]
The design and embroidery of the tapestry form one of the narrative strands of Marta Morazzoni&#39;s 1988 novella The Invention of Truth.
The tapestry is referenced in Tony Kushner&#39;s play Angels in America. The apocryphal account of Queen Matilda&#39;s creation of the tapestry is used, perhaps in order to demonstrate that Louis, one of the main characters, holds himself to mythological standards.[55]</div></div><div class="card" data-v-df454066><div class="question" data-v-df454066>When did germany become a member of the un?</div><div class="separator" data-v-df454066></div><div class="answer" data-v-df454066>18 September 1973ðŸš¨The relationship of Germany and the United Nations first began during World War II. The United Nations then was synonymous with the Allies of World War II and Germany then being the Greater German Reich, a member of the Axis powers. With the war ending in the defeat of Germany, the country&#39;s territory was divided amongst the victors and what was to remain Germany was under Allied administration. In 1949, two new countries were created in these occupied territories: the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) in May and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in October.
Both Germanys were admitted as full members of the United Nations (UN) on 18 September 1973. The two countries eventually merged on 3 October 1990, signifying an end of the Cold war era.
Today, Germany is the third largest contributor to the UN budget, after the United States and Japan, with 190 million US dollars, or roughly 8% of the UN budget for the 2010-11 biennial budget.[1]


The Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) was admitted to the UN as an observer in 1955. The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was admitted as an observer in 1972.[2] On 18 September 1973 both were admitted as full members by the United Nations General Assembly, following the recommendation of the Security Council by Resolution 335 on 22 June 1973. Through the accession of the German Democratic Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany, it was effective on 3 October 1990. The territory of the German Democratic Republic became part of the Federal Republic of Germany, today simply known as Germany [3]. Consequently, the Federal Republic of Germany continued being a member of the UN while the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist.[4]
For the years of 2011 to 2012 Germany has been elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). However, Germany received criticism from its European and US allies for abstaining on the Libyan no-fly zone resolution that they were voting for. Former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer argued that &quot;Germany has lost its credibility in the United Nations and in the Middle East. German hopes for a permanent seat on the Security Council have been permanently dashed and one is now fearful of Europe&#39;s future.&quot;[5][6]
France and the United Kingdom have explicitly called for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council for their close EU partner.[7][8] French president Jacques Chirac said in a speech in Berlin in 2000 that &quot;Germany&#39;s engagement, its ranking as a great power, its international influenceFrance would like to see them recognized with a permanent seat on the Security Council&quot;.[9] The former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schr?der, also identified Russia, among other countries, as a country that backed Germany&#39;s bid.[10] Italy and the Netherlands on the contrary, suggest a common European Union (EU) seat in the Council instead of Germany becoming the third European member next to France and the UK. The former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said that Germany would also accept a common European seat; however, as long as France and the UK are not willing to give up their own seats, Germany should also have a seat.[10] Thus, the German campaign for a permanent seat was intensified in 2004. Schr?der made himself perfectly clear in August 2004: &quot;Germany has the right to a seat.&quot;[11] Its bid is supported by Japan, India, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom and Russia, among other countries. Current German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had initially been quiet on the issue, re-stated Germany&#39;s bid in her address to the UN General Assembly in September 2007. In July 2011, Merkel&#39;s trip to Kenya, Angola, and Nigeria was thought to be motivated, in part, by the goal of seeking support from African countries for Germany&#39;s bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council.[12]</div></div><div class="card" data-v-df454066><div class="question" data-v-df454066>Who is the director of the fifth element?</div><div class="separator" data-v-df454066></div><div class="answer" data-v-df454066>Luc BessonðŸš¨Luc Besson (French:?[lyk b?s??]; born 18 March 1959) is a French film director, screenwriter, and producer. He directed or produced the films Subway (1985), The Big Blue (1988), and Nikita (1990). Besson is known for his distinctive filmmaking style and is associated with the movement critics call Cinma du look. He has been nominated for a Csar Award for Best Director and Best Picture for his films Lon: The Professional and The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc. He won Best Director and Best French Director for his sci-fi action film The Fifth Element (1997). He wrote and directed the 2014 sci-fi thriller film Lucy.
In 1980, he founded his own production company, called Les Films du Loup, and later Les Films du Dauphin?(fr). This was superseded in 2000 by his co-founding EuropaCorp film company with his longtime collaborator, Pierre-Ange Le Pogam?(fr). As writer, director, or producer, Besson has so far been involved in the creation of more than 50 films.


Besson was born in Paris, to parents who both worked as Club Med scuba-diving instructors.[1] Influenced by this milieu, as a child Besson planned to become a marine biologist. He spent much of his youth traveling with his parents to tourist resorts in Italy, SFR Yugoslavia, and Greece.[2] The family returned to France when Besson was 10. His parents promptly divorced and each remarried.
&quot;Here there is two families, and I am the only bad souvenir of something that doesn&#39;t work,&quot; he said in the International Herald Tribune. &quot;And if I disappear, then everything is perfect. The rage to exist comes from here. I have to do something! Otherwise I am going to die.&quot;[3]
At the age of 17, Besson had a diving accident that left him unable to dive.[4]
&quot;I was 17 and I wondered what I was going to do. ... So I took a piece of paper and on the left I put everything I could do, or had skills for, and all the things I couldn&#39;t do. The first line was shorter and I could see that I loved writing, I loved images, I was taking a lot of pictures. So I thought maybe movies would be good. But I thought that to really know I should go to a set. And a friend of mine knew a guy whose brother was a third assistant on a short film. It&#39;s true,&quot; he said in a 2000 interview with The Guardian.[5]

&quot;So, I said: &#39;OK, let&#39;s go on the set.&#39; So I went on the set...The day after I went back to see my mum and told her that I was going to make films and stop school and &#39;bye. And I did it! Very soon after I made a short film and it was very, very bad. I wanted to prove that I could do something, so I made a short film. That was in fact my main concern, to be able to show that I could do one.&quot;[5]
He reportedly worked on the first drafts of Le Grand Bleu while still in his teens. Out of boredom, Besson started writing stories, including the background to what he later developed as The Fifth Element (1997), one of his most popular movies.[6] The film is inspired by the French comic books which Besson read as a teenager. Besson directed and co-wrote the screenplay of this science fiction thriller with the screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen.[7]
At 18, Besson returned to his birthplace of Paris. There he took odd jobs in film to get a feel for the industry. He worked as an assistant to directors including Claude Faraldo and Patrick Grandperret. Besson directed three short films, a commissioned documentary, and several commercials.[8]
After this, he moved to the United States for three years, but returned to Paris, where he formed his own production company. He first named it Les Films du Loup, but changed it to Les Films du Dauphin. In the early 1980s, Besson met ric Serra and asked him to compose the score for his first short film, L&#39;Avant dernier. He later used Serra as a composer for other films of his.
Since the late 20th century, Besson has written and produced numerous action movies, including the Taxi (1998Ã¿2007) and The Transporter (2002Ã¿2008) series, and the Jet Li films Kiss of the Dragon and Unleashed/Danny the Dog. His English-language films Taken, Taken 2 and Taken 3, all starring Liam Neeson, have been major successes, with Taken 2 becoming the largest-grossing export French film. Besson produced the promotional movie for the Paris bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics.
Besson won Best Director and Best French Director for his film The Fifth Element (1997). He was nominated for Best Director and Best Picture Csar Awards for his films Lon: The Professional (1994) and The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999).
French actor Jean Reno has appeared in several films by Besson, including Le dernier combat (1985), Subway, The Big Blue (1988), Nikita (1990), and Lon: The Professional (1994).
Critics[who?] cite Besson as a pivotal figure in the Cinma du look movement, a specific, highly visual style produced from the 1980s into the early 1990s. Subway (1985), The Big Blue (1988) and Nikita (1990) are all considered to be of this stylistic school. The term was coined by critic Rapha?l Bassan in a 1989 essay in La Revue du Cinema n 449.[9] A partisan of the experimental cinema and friend of the New Wave (&quot;nouvelle vague&quot;) directors, Bassan grouped Besson with Jean-Jacques Beineix and Leos Carax as three directors who shared the style of &quot;le look.&quot; These directors were later described critically as favoring style over substance, and spectacle over narrative.[10]
Besson, along with most of the filmmakers so categorized, was uncomfortable with the label, particularly in light of the achievements of their forebears: France&#39;s New Wave. &quot;Jean-Luc Godard and Fran?ois Truffaut were rebelling against existing cultural values and used cinema as a means of expression simply because it was the most avant-garde medium at the time,&quot; said Besson in a 1985 interview in The New York Times. &quot;Today, the revolution is occurring entirely within the industry and is led by people who want to change the look of movies by making them better, more convincing and pleasurable to watch.
&quot;Because it&#39;s becoming increasingly difficult to break into this field, we have developed a psychological armor and are ready to do anything in order to work&quot;, he added in this same interview. &quot;I think our ardor alone is going to shake the pillars of the moviemaking establishment.&quot;[11]
Besson directed a biopic of Aung San Suu Kyi called The Lady (original title Dans la Lumiere), which was released in the fall of 2011. He also worked on Lockout, which was released in April 2012.[12]
Many of Besson&#39;s films have achieved popular, if not critical, success. One such release was Le Grand Bleu.
&quot;When the film had its premiere on opening night at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival, it was mercilessly drubbed, but no matter; it was a smash,&quot; observed the International Herald Tribune in a 2007 profile of Besson. &quot;Embraced by young people who kept returning to see it again, the movie sold 10?million tickets and quickly became what the French call a &#39;film gnrationnel,&#39; a defining moment in the culture.&quot;[13]
Besson created the Arthur series, which comprises Arthur and the Minimoys, Arthur and the Forbidden City, Arthur and the Vengeance of Maltazard and Arthur and the War of the Two Worlds. He directed Arthur and the Invisibles, an adaptation of the first two books of the collection. A film with live action and animation, it was released in the UK and the US and starred Freddie Highmore, Madonna, Snoop Dogg, Mia Farrow, Robert De Niro and David Bowie.
Besson has been described as &quot;the most Hollywood of French filmmakers.&quot;[14] Scott Tobias wrote that his &quot;slick, commercial&quot; action movies were &quot;so interchangeabledrugs, sleaze, chuckling supervillainy, and Hong Kong-style effectsthat each new project probably starts with white-out on the title page.&quot;[15]
American film critic Armond White has praised Besson, whom he ranks as one of the best film producers, for refining and revolutionizing action film. He wrote that Besson dramatizes the struggle of his characters &quot;as a conscientious resistance to human degradation&quot;.[16]
Besson has been married four times; first, in 1986, to actress Anne Parillaud who starred in Besson&#39;s Nikita (1990).[citation needed] Besson and Parillaud had a daughter, Juliette, born in 1987. The couple divorced in 1991.
Besson&#39;s second wife was actress Ma?wenn Le Besco, who was 15 when they began dating in 1991.[17] They were married in late 1992 when Le Besco was pregnant with their daughter Shanna, who was born on 3 January 1993.[18] Le Besco later claimed that their relationship inspired Besson&#39;s film Lon (1994), where the plot involved the emotional relationship between an adult man and a 12-year-old girl.[17] Their marriage ended in 1997, when Besson became involved with actress Milla Jovovich during the filming of The Fifth Element (1997). He married the 22-year-old on 14 December 1997, at the age of 38, but they divorced in 1999.[19]
On 28 August 2004, at the age of 45, Besson married film producer Virginie Silla. The couple has three children: Thalia, Sateen, and Mao Besson.[20]
Among Besson&#39;s awards are the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film Critics Prize, Fantasporto Audience Jury Award-Special Mention, Best Director, and Best Film, for Le Dernier Combat in 1983; the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon-Best Director-Foreign Film, for La Femme Nikita, 1990; the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Nil by Mouth, 1997; and the Best Director Cesar Award, for The Fifth Element, 1997.[7]
In 2000, Besson superseded his production company by co-founding EuropaCorp with Pierre-Ange Le Pogam, with whom he had frequently worked since 1985. Le Pogam had then been Distribution Director with Gaumont. EuropaCorp has had strong growth based on several English-language films, with international distribution. It has production facilities in Paris, Normandy, and Hollywood, and is establishing distribution partnerships in Japan and China.</div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button">See more</button></section><!--]--></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright Â© 2014-2024 answer</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
