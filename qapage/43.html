He was formerly editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics,[2] and later its publisher[3] and chairman[4] before leaving the company to become its chairman emeritus, as well as a member of the editorial board.[5]
In collaboration with several artists, including Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he co-created fictional characters including Spider-Man, the Hulk, Doctor Strange, the Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Black Panther, the X-Men, and, with the addition of co-writer Larry Lieber, the characters Ant-Man, Iron Man and Thor. In addition, he challenged the comics industry&#39;s censorship organization, the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to it updating its policies. Lee subsequently led the expansion of Marvel Comics from a small division of a publishing house to a large multimedia corporation.
He was inducted into the comic book industry&#39;s Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. Lee received a National Medal of Arts in 2008.


Stanley Martin Lieber was born on December 28, 1922 in Manhattan, New York City,[6] in the apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish immigrant parents, Celia (ne Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th Street and West End Avenue in Manhattan.[7][8] His father, trained as a dress cutter, worked only sporadically after the Great Depression,[7] and the family moved further uptown to Fort Washington Avenue,[9] in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Lee has one younger brother named Larry Lieber.[10] He said in 2006 that as a child he was influenced by books and movies, particularly those with Errol Flynn playing heroic roles.[11] By the time Lee was in his teens, the family was living in an apartment at 1720 University Avenue in The Bronx. Lee has described it as &quot;a third-floor apartment facing out back&quot;. Lee and his brother shared the bedroom, while their parents slept on a foldout couch.[10]
Lee attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx.[12] In his youth, Lee enjoyed writing, and entertained dreams of one day writing the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;.[13] He has said that in his youth he worked such part-time jobs as writing obituaries for a news service and press releases for the National Tuberculosis Center;[14] delivering sandwiches for the Jack May pharmacy to offices in Rockefeller Center; working as an office boy for a trouser manufacturer; ushering at the Rivoli Theater on Broadway;[15] and selling subscriptions to the New York Herald Tribune newspaper.[16] He graduated from high school early, aged 16? in 1939, and joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project.[17]
With the help of his uncle Robbie Solomon,[18] Lee became an assistant in 1939 at the new Timely Comics division of pulp magazine and comic-book publisher Martin Goodman&#39;s company. Timely, by the 1960s, would evolve into Marvel Comics. Lee, whose cousin Jean[19] was Goodman&#39;s wife, was formally hired by Timely editor Joe Simon.[n 1]
His duties were prosaic at first. &quot;In those days [the artists] dipped the pen in ink, [so] I had to make sure the inkwells were filled&quot;, Lee recalled in 2009. &quot;I went down and got them their lunch, I did proofreading, I erased the pencils from the finished pages for them&quot;.[21] Marshaling his childhood ambition to be a writer, young Stanley Lieber made his comic-book debut with the text filler &quot;Captain America Foils the Traitor&#39;s Revenge&quot; in Captain America Comics #3 (cover-dated May 1941), using the pseudonym Stan Lee,[22] which years later he would adopt as his legal name.[citation needed] Lee later explained in his autobiography and numerous other sources that he had intended to save his given name for more literary work. This initial story also introduced Captain America&#39;s trademark ricocheting shield-toss.[23]:11
He graduated from writing filler to actual comics with a backup feature, &quot;&#39;Headline&#39; Hunter, Foreign Correspondent&quot;, two issues later. Lee&#39;s first superhero co-creation was the Destroyer, in Mystic Comics #6 (August 1941). Other characters he co-created during this period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books include Jack Frost, debuting in U.S.A. Comics #1 (August 1941), and Father Time, debuting in Captain America Comics #6 (August 1941).[23]:12Ã¿13
When Simon and his creative partner Jack Kirby left late in 1941, following a dispute with Goodman, the 30-year-old publisher installed Lee, just under 19 years old, as interim editor.[23]:14 [24] The youngster showed a knack for the business that led him to remain as the comic-book division&#39;s editor-in-chief, as well as art director for much of that time, until 1972, when he would succeed Goodman as publisher.[2][25]
Lee entered the United States Army in early 1942 and served in the US in the Signal Corps, repairing telegraph poles and other communications equipment.[26] He was later transferred to the Training Film Division, where he worked writing manuals, training films, and slogans, and occasionally cartooning.[27] His military classification, he says, was &quot;playwright&quot;; he adds that only nine men in the US Army were given that title.[28] Vincent Fago, editor of Timely&#39;s &quot;animation comics&quot; section, which put out humor and funny animal comics, filled in until Lee returned from his World War II military service in 1945.
In the mid-1950s, by which time the company was now generally known as Atlas Comics, Lee wrote stories in a variety of genres including romance, Westerns, humor, science fiction, medieval adventure, horror and suspense. In the 1950s, Lee teamed up with his comic book colleague Dan DeCarlo to produce the syndicated newspaper strip, My Friend Irma, based on the radio comedy starring Marie Wilson.[29] By the end of the decade, Lee had become dissatisfied with his career and considered quitting the field.[30][31]
In the late 1950s, DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz revived the superhero archetype and experienced a significant success with its updated version of the Flash, and later with super-team the Justice League of America. In response, publisher Martin Goodman assigned Lee to come up with a new superhero team. Lee&#39;s wife suggested him to experiment with stories he preferred, since he was planning on changing careers and had nothing to lose.[30][31]
Lee acted on that advice, giving his superheroes a flawed humanity, a change from the ideal archetypes that were typically written for preteens. Before this, most superheroes were idealistically perfect people with no serious, lasting problems.[32] Lee introduced complex, naturalistic characters[33] who could have bad tempers, fits of melancholy, and vanity; they bickered amongst themselves, worried about paying their bills and impressing girlfriends, got bored or even were sometimes physically ill.
The first superhero group Lee and artist Jack Kirby created together was the Fantastic Four, based on previous Kirby superhero team Challengers of the Unknown published by DC Comics[34] The team&#39;s immediate popularity[35] led Lee and Marvel&#39;s illustrators to produce a cavalcade of new titles. Again working with Kirby, Lee co-created the Hulk,[36] Thor,[37] Iron Man,[38] and the X-Men;[39] with Bill Everett, Daredevil;[40] and with Steve Ditko, Doctor Strange[41] and Marvel&#39;s most successful character, Spider-Man,[42] all of whom lived in a thoroughly shared universe.[43] Lee and Kirby gathered several of their newly created characters together into the team title The Avengers[44] and would revive characters from the 1940s such as the Sub-Mariner[45] and Captain America.[46]
Comics historian Peter Sanderson wrote that in the 1960s:
DC was the equivalent of the big Hollywood studios: After the brilliance of DC&#39;s reinvention of the superhero ... in the late 1950s and early 1960s, it had run into a creative drought by the decade&#39;s end. There was a new audience for comics now, and it wasn&#39;t just the little kids that traditionally had read the books. The Marvel of the 1960s was in its own way the counterpart of the French New Wave.... Marvel was pioneering new methods of comics storytelling and characterization, addressing more serious themes, and in the process keeping and attracting readers in their teens and beyond. Moreover, among this new generation of readers were people who wanted to write or draw comics themselves, within the new style that Marvel had pioneered, and push the creative envelope still further.[47]
Lee&#39;s revolution extended beyond the characters and storylines to the way in which comic books engaged the readership and built a sense of community between fans and creators.[48] He introduced the practice of regularly including a credit panel on the splash page of each story, naming not just the writer and penciller but also the inker and letterer. Regular news about Marvel staff members and upcoming storylines was presented on the Bullpen Bulletins page, which (like the letter columns that appeared in each title) was written in a friendly, chatty style. Lee has said that his goal was for fans to think of the comics creators as friends, and considered it a mark of his success on this front that, at a time when letters to other comics publishers were typically addressed &quot;Dear Editor&quot;, letters to Marvel addressed the creators by first name (e.g. &quot;Dear Stan and Jack&quot;).[26] By 1967, the brand was well-enough ensconced in popular culture that a March 3 WBAI radio program with Lee and Kirby as guests was titled &quot;Will Success Spoil Spiderman&quot; [sic].[49]
Throughout the 1960s, Lee scripted, art-directed and edited most of Marvel&#39;s series, moderated the letters pages, wrote a monthly column called &quot;Stan&#39;s Soapbox&quot;, and wrote endless promotional copy, often signing off with his trademark motto, &quot;Excelsior!&quot; (which is also the New York state motto). To maintain his workload and meet deadlines, he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios, but due to Lee&#39;s success with it, became known as the &quot;Marvel Method&quot;. Typically, Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling. After the artist turned in penciled pages, Lee would write the word balloons and captions, and then oversee the lettering and coloring. In effect, the artists were co-plotters, whose collaborative first drafts Lee built upon. Lee recorded messages to the newly formed Merry Marvel Marching Society fan club in 1965.[50]
Following Ditko&#39;s departure from Marvel in 1966, John Romita Sr. became Lee&#39;s collaborator on The Amazing Spider-Man. Within a year, it overtook Fantastic Four to become the company&#39;s top seller.[51] Lee and Romita&#39;s stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man&#39;s adventures.[52] The stories became more topical, addressing issues such as the Vietnam War,[53] political elections,[54] and student activism.[55] Robbie Robertson, introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man #51 (August 1967) was one of the first African-American characters in comics to play a serious supporting role.[56] In the Fantastic Four series, the lengthy run by Lee and Kirby produced many acclaimed storylines as well as characters that have become central to Marvel, including the Inhumans[57][58] and the Black Panther,[59] an African king who would be mainstream comics&#39; first black superhero.[60]
The story frequently cited as Lee and Kirby&#39;s finest achievement[61][62] is the three-part &quot;Galactus Trilogy&quot; that began in Fantastic Four #48 (March 1966), chronicling the arrival of Galactus, a cosmic giant who wanted to devour the planet, and his herald, the Silver Surfer.[63][64] Fantastic Four #48 was chosen as #24 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel&#39;s readers in 2001. Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that &quot;As the fourth year of the Fantastic Four came to a close, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby seemed to be only warming up. In retrospect, it was perhaps the most fertile period of any monthly title during the Marvel Age.&quot;[65] Comics historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;[t]he mystical and metaphysical elements that took over the saga were perfectly suited to the tastes of young readers in the 1960s&quot;, and Lee soon discovered that the story was a favorite on college campuses.[66] Lee and artist John Buscema launched The Silver Surfer series in August 1968.[67][68]
The following year, Lee and Gene Colan created the Falcon, comics&#39; first African-American superhero in Captain America #117 (September 1969).[69] Then in 1971, Lee indirectly helped reform the Comics Code.[70] The U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare had asked Lee to write a comic-book story about the dangers of drugs and Lee conceived a three-issue subplot in The Amazing Spider-Man #96Ã¿98 (cover-dated MayÃ¿July 1971), in which Peter Parker&#39;s best friend becomes addicted to pills. The Comics Code Authority refused to grant its seal because the stories depicted drug use; the anti-drug context was considered irrelevant. With Goodman&#39;s cooperation and confident that the original government request would give him credibility, Lee had the story published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts.[71] The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms.[72][73]
Lee also supported using comic books to provide some measure of social commentary about the real world, often dealing with racism and bigotry.[74] &quot;Stan&#39;s Soapbox&quot;, besides promoting an upcoming comic book project, also addressed issues of discrimination, intolerance, or prejudice.[75][76]
In 1972, Lee stopped writing monthly comic books to assume the role of publisher. His final issue of The Amazing Spider-Man was #110 (July 1972)[77] and his last Fantastic Four was #125 (August 1972).[78]
In later years, Lee became a figurehead and public face for Marvel Comics. He made appearances at comic book conventions around America, lecturing at colleges and participating in panel discussions. Lee and John Romita Sr. launched the Spider-Man newspaper comic strip on January 3, 1977.[79] Lee&#39;s final collaboration with Jack Kirby, The Silver Surfer: The Ultimate Cosmic Experience, was published in 1978 as part of the Marvel Fireside Books series and is considered to be Marvel&#39;s first graphic novel.[80] Lee and John Buscema produced the first issue of The Savage She-Hulk (February 1980), which introduced the female cousin of the Hulk[81] and crafted a Silver Surfer story for Epic Illustrated #1 (Spring 1980).[82] He moved to California in 1981 to develop Marvel&#39;s TV and movie properties. He has been an executive producer for, and has made cameo appearances in, Marvel film adaptations and other movies. He occasionally returned to comic book writing with various Silver Surfer projects including a 1982 one-shot drawn by John Byrne,[83] the Judgment Day graphic novel illustrated by John Buscema,[84] the Parable limited series drawn by French artist M?bius,[85] and The Enslavers graphic novel with Keith Pollard.[86] Lee was briefly president of the entire company, but soon stepped down to become publisher instead, finding that being president was too much about numbers and finance and not enough about the creative process he enjoyed.[87]
Peter Paul and Lee began a new Internet-based superhero creation, production, and marketing studio, Stan Lee Media, in 1998.[88] It grew to 165 people and went public through a reverse merger structured by investment banker Stan Medley in 1999, but, near the end of 2000, investigators discovered illegal stock manipulation by Paul and corporate officer Stephan Gordon.[89] Stan Lee Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2001.[90] Paul was extradited to the U.S. from Brazil and pleaded guilty to violating SEC Rule 10b-5 in connection with trading of his stock in Stan Lee Media.[91][92] Lee was never implicated in the scheme. In 2001, Lee, Gill Champion, and Arthur Lieberman formed POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment to develop film, television and video game properties. Lee created the risqu animated superhero series Stripperella for Spike TV. In 2004 POW! Entertainment went public. Also that year, Lee announced a superhero program that would feature Ringo Starr, the former Beatle, as the lead character.[93][94] Additionally, in August of that year, Lee announced the launch of Stan Lee&#39;s Sunday Comics,[95] a short-lived subscription service hosted by Komikwerks.com. On March 15, 2007, after Stan Lee Media had been purchased by Jim Nesfield, the company filed a lawsuit against Marvel Entertainment for $5?billion, claiming Lee had given his rights to several Marvel characters to Stan Lee Media in exchange for stock and a salary.[96] On June 9, 2007, Stan Lee Media sued Lee; his newer company, POW! Entertainment; and POW! subsidiary QED Entertainment.[97][98]
In 2008, Lee wrote humorous captions for the political fumetti book Stan Lee Presents Election Daze: What Are They Really Saying?.[99] In April of that year, Brighton Partners and Rainmaker Animation announced a partnership POW! to produce a CGI film series, Legion of 5.[100] Other projects by Lee announced in the late 2000s included a line of superhero comics for Virgin Comics,[101] a TV adaptation of the novel Hero,[102] a foreword to Skyscraperman by skyscraper fire-safety advocate and Spider-Man fan Dan Goodwin,[103] a partnership with Guardian Media Entertainment and The Guardian Project to create NHL superhero mascots[104] and work with the Eagle Initiative program to find new talent in the comic book field.[105]
In October, Lee announced he would partner with 1821 Comics on a multimedia imprint for children, Stan Lee&#39;s Kids Universe, a move he said addressed the lack of comic books targeted for that demographic; and that he was collaborating with the company on its futuristic graphic novel Romeo &amp; Juliet: The War, by writer Max Work and artist Skan Srisuwan.[106][107] At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, Lee announced his YouTube channel, Stan Lee&#39;s World of Heroes, which airs programs created by Lee, Mark Hamill, Peter David, Adrianne Curry, and Bonnie Burton among others.[108][109][110][111] Lee wrote the book, Zodiac released in January 2015, with Stuart Moore.[112] The film Stan Lee&#39;s Annihilator, based on a Chinese prisoner-turned-superhero named Ming and in production since 2013, is set for a 2015 release.[113][114][115]
In his later career, Lee&#39;s contributions continued to expand outside the style that he helped pioneer. An example of this is his first work for DC Comics in the 2000s, launching the Just Imagine... series, in which Lee re-imagined the DC superheroes Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and the Flash.[116] Manga projects involving Lee include Karakurid?ji Ultimo, a collaboration with Hiroyuki Takei, Viz Media and Shueisha,[117] and Heroman, serialized in Square Enix&#39;s Monthly Shnen Gangan with the Japanese company Bones.[118][119] In 2011, Lee started writing a live-action musical, The Yin and Yang Battle of Tao.[120]
This period also saw a number of collaborators honor Lee for his influence on the comics industry. In 2006, Marvel commemorated Lee&#39;s 65 years with the company by publishing a series of one-shot comics starring Lee himself meeting and interacting with many of his co-creations, including Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, the Thing, Silver Surfer, and Doctor Doom. These comics also featured short pieces by such comics creators as Joss Whedon and Fred Hembeck, as well as reprints of classic Lee-written adventures.[121] At the 2007 Comic-Con International, Marvel Legends introduced a Stan Lee action figure. The body beneath the figure&#39;s removable cloth wardrobe is a re-used mold of a previously released Spider-Man action figure, with minor changes.[122] Comikaze Expo, Los Angeles&#39; largest comic book convention, was rebranded as Stan Lee&#39;s Comikaze Presented by POW! Entertainment in 2012.[123]
At the 2016 Comic-Con International, Lee introduced his digital graphic novel Stan Lee&#39;s &#39;God Woke&#39;,[124][125][126] with text originally written as a poem he presented at Carnegie Hall in 1972.[127] The print-book version won the 2017 Independent Publisher Book Awards&#39; Outstanding Books of the Year Independent Voice Award.[128]
The Stan Lee Foundation was founded in 2010 to focus on literacy, education, and the arts. Its stated goals include supporting programs and ideas that improve access to literacy resources, as well as promoting diversity, national literacy, culture and the arts.[129]
Stan Lee has donated portions of his personal effects to the University of Wyoming at various times, between 1981 and 2001.[130]
Stan Lee and his collaborator Jack Kirby appear as themselves in The Fantastic Four #10 (January 1963), the first of several appearances within the fictional Marvel Universe.[131] The two are depicted as similar to their real-world counterparts, creating comic books based on the &quot;real&quot; adventures of the Fantastic Four.
Lee was parodied by Kirby in comics published by rival DC Comics as Funky Flashman.[132] Kirby later portrayed himself, Lee, production executive Sol Brodsky, and Lee&#39;s secretary Flo Steinberg as superheroes in What If #11 (October 1978), &quot;What If the Marvel Bullpen Had Become the Fantastic Four?&quot;, in which Lee played the part of Mister Fantastic. Lee has also made numerous cameo appearances in many Marvel titles, appearing in audiences and crowds at many characters&#39; ceremonies and parties, and hosting an old-soldiers reunion in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #100 (July 1972). Lee appeared, unnamed, as the priest at Luke Cage and Jessica Jones&#39; wedding in New Avengers Annual #1 (June 2006). He pays his respects to Karen Page at her funeral in Daredevil vol. 2, #8 (June 1998), and appears in The Amazing Spider-Man #169 (June 1977).
In 1994, artist Alex Ross rendered Lee as a bar patron on page 44 of Marvels #3.[133]
In Marvel&#39;s &quot;Flashback&quot; series of titles cover-dated July 1997, a top-hatted caricature of Lee as a ringmaster introduced stories that detailed events in Marvel characters&#39; lives before they became superheroes, in special &quot;-1&quot; editions of many Marvel titles. The &quot;ringmaster&quot; depiction of Lee was originally from Generation X #17 (July 1996), where the character narrated a story set primarily in an abandoned circus. Though the story itself was written by Scott Lobdell, the narration by &quot;Ringmaster Stan&quot; was written by Lee, and the character was drawn in that issue by Chris Bachalo.
Lee and other comics creators are mentioned on page 479 of Michael Chabon&#39;s 2000 novel about the comics industry The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. Chabon also acknowledges a debt to Lee and other creators on the book&#39;s Author&#39;s Note page.
On one of the last pages of Truth: Red, White &amp; Black, Lee appears in a real photograph among other celebrities on a wall of the Bradley home.[134] Under his given name of Stanley Lieber, Stan Lee appears briefly in Paul Malmont&#39;s 2006 novel The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril.[135]
In Stan Lee Meets Superheroes, which Lee wrote, he comes into contact with some of his favorite creations.[121] Stan Lee and Jack Kirby appear as professors in Marvel Adventures Spider-Man #19.
In Lavie Tidhar&#39;s 2013 The Violent Century, Lee appears Ã¿ under his birth name of &quot;Stanley Martin Lieber&quot; Ã¿ as a historian of superhumans.[136]
Lee has had cameo appearances in many Marvel film and television projects. A few of these appearances are self-aware and sometimes reference Lee&#39;s involvement in the creation of certain characters. Lee has been a credited executive producer on most Marvel film and television projects since the 1990 direct-to-video Captain America film.
In the original February 7, 1998, broadcast airing of the Superman: The Animated Series episode &quot;Apokolips... Now! Part 2&quot; on the Kids&#39; WB programming block, an animated Funky Flashman was visible mourning the death of Daniel &quot;Terrible&quot; Turpin, a character based on his longtime Marvel Comics collaborator Jack Kirby. This shot was later modified to remove the likeness of Lee and of other background Marvel characters when the episode was released on DVD.[172][173]
Lee was raised in a Jewish family. In a 2002 survey of whether he believes in God, he stated, &quot;Well, let me put it this way... [Pauses.] No, I&#39;m not going to try to be clever. I really don&#39;t know. I just don&#39;t know.&quot;[200]
From 1945 to 1947, Lee lived in the rented top floor of a brownstone in the East 90s in Manhattan.[201] He married Joan Clayton Boocock on December 5, 1947,[202][203] and in 1949, the couple bought house at 1084 West Broadway in Woodmere, New York, on Long Island, living there through 1952.[204] Their daughter Joan Celia &quot;J. C.&quot; Lee was born in 1950. Another child, daughter Jan Lee, died three days after delivery in 1953.[205] The Lees resided at 226 Richards Lane in the Long Island town of Hewlett Harbor, New York, from 1952 to 1980.[206] They also owned a condominium at 220 East 63rd Street in Manhattan from 1975 to 1980,[207] and, during the 1970s, a vacation home on Cutler Lane in Remsenburg, New York.[208] For their move to the west coast in 1981, he and his wife bought a home in West Hollywood, California previously owned by comedian Jack Benny&#39;s radio announcer, Don Wilson.[209]
In late September 2012, Lee underwent an operation to insert a pacemaker, cancelling planned appearances at conventions.[210][211]
On July 6, 2017, his wife of 69 years, Joan, died of complications from a stroke. She was 95 years old.[212]
On July 14, 2017, Lee and Jack Kirby were named Disney Legends for their creation of numerous characters that would comprise Disney&#39;s Marvel Cinematic Universe.[230]
On July 18, 2017, as part of D23 Disney Legends event, a ceremony was held on TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood Boulevard where Stan Lee imprinted his hands, feet and signature in cement.[231]
Lee&#39;s comics work includes:[82]
I applied for a job in a publishing company ... I didn&#39;t even know they published comics. I was fresh out of high school, and I wanted to get into the publishing business, if I could. There was an ad in the paper that said, &quot;Assistant Wanted in a Publishing House.&quot; When I found out that they wanted me to assist in comics, I figured, &#39;Well, I&#39;ll stay here for a little while and get some experience, and then I&#39;ll get out into the real world.&#39; ... I just wanted to know, &#39;What do you do in a publishing company?&#39; How do you write? ... How do you publish? I was an assistant. There were two people there named Joe Simon and Jack Kirby Ã¿ Joe was sort-of the editor/artist/writer, and Jack was the artist/writer. Joe was the senior member. They were turning out most of the artwork. Then there was the publisher, Martin Goodman... And that was about the only staff that I was involved with. After a while, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby left. I was about 17 years old [sic], and Martin Goodman said to me, &#39;Do you think you can hold down the job of editor until I can find a real person?&#39; When you&#39;re 17, what do you know? I said, &#39;Sure! I can do it!&#39; I think he forgot about me, because I stayed there ever since.[20]
However, in his 2002 autobiography, Excelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee he writes:
My uncle, Robbie Solomon, told me they might be able to use someone at a publishing company where he worked. The idea of being involved in publishing definitely appealed to me. ... So I contacted the man Robbie said did the hiring, Joe Simon, and applied for a job. He took me on and I began working as a gofer for eight dollars a week....
Joe Simon, in his 1990 autobiography The Comic Book Makers, gives the account slightly differently: &quot;One day [Goodman&#39;s relative known as] Uncle Robbie came to work with a lanky 17-year-old in tow. &#39;This is Stanley Lieber, Martin&#39;s wife&#39;s cousin,&#39; Uncle Robbie said. &#39;Martin wants you to keep him busy.&#39;&quot;
In an appendix, however, Simon appears to reconcile the two accounts. He relates a 1989 conversation with Lee:
Lee: I&#39;ve been saying this [classified-ad] story for years, but apparently it isn&#39;t so. And I can&#39;t remember because I[&#39;ve] said it so long now that I believe it.&quot;
...
Simon: &quot;Your Uncle Robbie brought you into the office one day and he said, &#39;This is Martin Goodman&#39;s wife&#39;s nephew.&#39; [sic] ... You were seventeen years old.&quot;

Lee: &quot;Sixteen and a half!&quot;

Simon: &quot;Well, Stan, you told me seventeen. You were probably trying to be older.... I did hire you.&quot;
The DC comics were ... one dimensional characters whose only characteristic was they dressed up in costumes and did good. Whereas Stan Lee had this huge breakthrough of two-dimensional characters. So, they dress up in costumes and do good, but they&#39;ve got a bad heart. Or a bad leg. I actually did think for a long while that having a bad leg was an actual character trait.</div></div><div class="card" data-v-aa9ccaee><div class="question" data-v-aa9ccaee>Which country is the owner of nokia company?</div><div class="separator" data-v-aa9ccaee></div><div class="answer" data-v-aa9ccaee>FinlandðŸš¨Coordinates: 601332N 244503E? / ?60.2254749N 24.7508775E? / 60.2254749; 24.7508775
Nokia (Finnish: Nokia, Finnish pronunciation:?[?noki], UK: /?n?ki?/, US: /?no?ki?/) is a Finnish multinational communications, information technology and consumer electronics company, founded in 1865. Nokia&#39;s headquarters are in Espoo, Uusimaa, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[1] In 2016, Nokia employed approximately 101,000 people across over 100 countries, did business in more than 130 countries, and reported annual revenues of around ?23.6 billion.[3] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[4] It is the world&#39;s 415th-largest company measured by 2016 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500, and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5][6]
The company has had various industries in its 152-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill, but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development and licensing.[7] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM, 3G and LTE standards (and currently in 5G), and is best known for having been the largest worldwide vendor of mobile phones and smartphones for a period. After a partnership with Microsoft and market struggles, its mobile phone business was eventually bought by the former,[8][9] creating Microsoft Mobile as its successor in 2014.[10] After the sale, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business and on the Internet of things, marked by the divestiture of its Here mapping division and the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent. The company also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings),[11][12] and is the owner of scientific research organization Bell Labs.[13] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through a licensing arrangement with HMD Global.[14]
The company is viewed with national pride by Finns, as its successful mobile phone business made it by far the largest worldwide company and brand from Finland.[15] At its peak in 2000, during the telecoms bubble, Nokia alone accounted for 4% of the country&#39;s GDP, 21% of total exports and 70% of the Helsinki Stock Exchange market capital.[16][17]


Nokia&#39;s history dates back to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia, offering better hydropower resources. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company from it and called it Nokia Ab (in Swedish, Nokia Company being the English equivalent), after the site of the second pulp mill.
Idestam retired in 1896, making Mechelin the company&#39;s chairman. Mechelin expanded into electricity generation by 1902 which Idestam had opposed. In 1904 Suomen Gummitehdas (Finnish Rubber Works), a rubber business founded by Eduard PolÜ‡n, established a factory near the town of Nokia and used its name.
In 1922, Nokia Ab entered into a partnership with Finnish Rubber Works and Kaapelitehdas (the Cable Factory), all now jointly under the leadership of PolÜ‡n. Finnish Rubber Works company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply, and the cable company soon did too.
Nokia at the time also made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.[18]
In 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Kaapelitehdas and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created the new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for Finland&#39;s defence forces (Puolustusvoimat), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios, telephone switches, capacitors and chemicals.
After Finland&#39;s trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics among others; by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield high profits. Nokia also co-operated on scientific technology with the Soviet Union. The U.S. government became increasingly suspicious of that technologic co-operation after the end of the Cold War dtente in the early 1980s. Nokia imported many US-made components and used them for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with The Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[19] However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.
In 1977, Kari Kairamo became CEO and he transformed the company&#39;s businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called &quot;Nordic Japan&quot;. Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker Salora, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker Luxor AB in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind Philips and Thomson). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.
In 1987, Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany&#39;s Standard Elektrik Lorenz (SEL), which included its &quot;Schaub-Lorenz&quot; and &quot;Graetz&quot; brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate International Telephone &amp; Telegraph (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the &quot;ITT Nokia&quot; brand, despite SEL&#39;s sale to Compagnie Gnrale d&#39;Electricit (CGE), the predecessor of Alcatel, in 1986.[citation needed]
On 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of Ericsson&#39;s Information Systems,[20] which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters, minicomputers and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia&#39;s existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.
Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world&#39;s first international cellular network and the first to allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia&#39;s first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond&#39;s gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia&#39;s revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically CEO Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.
In 1987, Kaapelitehdas discontinued production of cables at its Helsinki factory after 44 years, effectively shutting down the sub-company.

Following Simo Vuorilehto&#39;s appointment as CEO, a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres (Nokian Renkaat), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK-based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia&#39;s stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.
Vuorilehto quit in early 1992 and was replaced by Jorma Ollila. He saw that despite troubles in the economy, Nokia&#39;s cellular business was booming. As a result, he decided to focus on wireless telecommunications and to get rid of non-core assets. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years.
Nokia&#39;s first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the Mobira Cityman 900 in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the GSM mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with Siemens, the predecessor to Nokia Siemens Network. The world&#39;s first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900?MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by Radiolinja. In November 1992, the Nokia 1011 launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.[21]
Salora Oy as a Nokia subsidiary ended in 1989 when the division was merged into Nokia-Mobira Oy. The brand continued to be used for televisions until 1995.
On 12 June 1996, Nokia announced the sale of its television business to Canada/Hong Kong-based Semi-Tech Corporation.[22] The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included a factory in Turku, and the rights to use the Nokia, Finlux, Luxor, Salora, Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.[23] Some of these brands were later sold to other companies.
Nokia was the first to launch digital satellite receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997.[24] In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with Common Interface (CI) support.[25] In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world&#39;s first digital terrestrial television set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as ONdigital.[26]
In October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,[27] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.[28] Nokia&#39;s mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake, which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company&#39;s most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, in 2003.
Nokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with stereo speakers and a sub-woofer.[29] In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first wireless LAN products.[30] In January 2000 ViewSonic acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making displays for personal computers.[31] On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with Telefonica to supply DSL modems and routers in Spain.[32]
In 1998, Nokia co-founded Symbian Ltd. led by Psion to create a new operating system for PDAs as a successor of EPOC32. In 2001 Nokia created the Series 60 platform on Symbian OS, later introducing it with their first camera phone, the Nokia 7650. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest smartphone hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd.[33] Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the Symbian Foundation as its successor.[34]
In 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people.[35]
The Nokia 3600/3650 was the first camera phone on sale in North America in 2003. The company would go on to become a successful and innovative camera phone maker. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker Carl Zeiss AG.[36] That same month Nokia introduced the Nseries, which would become its flagship line of smart phones for the next six years.[37] The Nokia N95 introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as &quot;best mobile imaging device&quot; in Europe in 2007.[38] Its successor the N82 featured a xenon flash,[39] which helped it win the award of &quot;best mobile imaging&quot; device in Europe in 2008.[40] The N93 in 2006 was known for its specialized camcorder and the twistable design that switches between clamshell and a camcorder-like position.[41] They were also well known for the N8 with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the 808 PureView in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the Lumia 920 flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced PureView technologies.[42]
In 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the handheld gaming market with the N-Gage.[43] Nokia&#39;s head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted &quot;Game Boy is for 10-year-olds&quot;,[44] stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader Nintendo. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008.[45]
Nokia launched mobile TV trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster Yle. The services are based on the DVB-H standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen Nokia 7710 smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals.[46] Nokia partnered with Arqiva and O2 to launch trials in the UK in September 2005.[47]
In 2005 Nokia developed a Linux-based operating system called Maemo, which shipped that year on the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet.
On 1 June 2006, Jorma Ollila became the company&#39;s chairman and retired as CEO, replaced by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.[48]
In August 2007, Nokia introduced Ovi, an umbrella name for the company&#39;s new Internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the Nokia Music Store.[49] The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against Apple&#39;s App Store when it was introduced in 2008.[50]
In October 2008 Nokia announced the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. In November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in Japan because of low market share.[51]
Nokia briefly returned to the computer market with the Booklet 3G netbook in August 2009.
In April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8, which would be the first to run on Symbian^3.[52] However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company&#39;s image,[53] especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and it was announced that Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia&#39;s CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia&#39;s history.[54]
The old Symbian OS became completely open source in February 2010.[55] However, in November 2010 it was announced that the Symbian Foundation was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing.[56] By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier NTT DoCoMo in Japan, after both Samsung and Sony Ericsson moved to Android. Meanwhile, in 2010 for Nokia&#39;s Linux ambitions, Nokia collaborated with Intel to form the MeeGo project, after the merger of Nokia&#39;s own Maemo and Intel&#39;s Moblin.
Nokia&#39;s Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of iOS and Android. To counter this, Nokia planned to make their MeeGo Linux operating system the company&#39;s flagship on smartphones. However, in February 2011, they scrapped MeeGo and announce a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone as Nokia&#39;s primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority. Although the MeeGo-based N9 was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia - apparently pressured by Microsoft[citation needed] - had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership. After the announcement of the Microsoft deal, Nokia&#39;s market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia&#39;s focus and attention would be elsewhere.[57] Nokia&#39;s first Windows Phone flagship was the Lumia 800, which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012, with the company&#39;s stock price falling below $2, Nokia almost became bankrupt.[58][59]
On 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as &quot;compensation for lost income from his prior employer,&quot; on top of his $1.4 million annual salary.[60] This was a turning point, since Elop has previously been a Microsoft employee in its Business Division. It later became clear that Microsoft was influential within Nokia, pushing forward its Windows Phone offering.
When the Lumia 920 was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly.[61] Although Nokia&#39;s smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation:[62] the company had had huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.[63] The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, as well as for Microsoft&#39;s CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company.[64] The sale was completed in April 2014, with Microsoft Mobile becoming the successor to Nokia&#39;s mobile devices division.
In July 2013, Nokia bought Siemens&#39; stake in the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture for $2.2 billion, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary called Nokia Solutions and Networks,[65] until being rebranded as Nokia Networks soon after.[66] During Nokia&#39;s financial struggles, its profitable networking division with Siemens provided much of its income; thus, the purchase proved to be positive, particularly after the sale of its mobile devices unit.[67]
After the sale of its mobile devices division, Nokia focused on network equipment through Nokia Networks.[68]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a US$970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[69]
On 17 November 2014, Nokia Technologies head Ramzi Haidamus disclosed that the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business as an original design manufacturer, licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. Haidamus stated that the Nokia brand was &quot;valuable&quot; but &quot;is diminishing in value, and that&#39;s why it is important that we reverse that trend very quickly, imminently.&quot;[70] The next day, Nokia unveiled the N1, an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn, as its first product following the Microsoft sale.[71] Haidamus emphasized that devices released under these licensing agreements would be held to high standards in production quality, and would &quot;look and feel just like Nokia built it.&quot;[7] Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri stated that the company planned to re-enter the mobile phone business in this manner in 2016, following the expiration of its non-compete clause with Microsoft.[72]
According to Robert Morlino, the spokesman of Nokia Technologies, Nokia planned follow the brand-licensing model rather than direct marketing of mobile devices due to the sale of its mobile devices division to Microsoft.[73] The company took aggressive steps to revitalize itself, evident through its hiring of software experts, testing of new products and seeking of sales partners.[74] On 14 July 2015, CEO Rajeev Suri confirmed that the company would make a return to the mobile phones market in 2016.[75]
On 28 July 2015, Nokia announced OZO, a 360-degrees virtual reality camera, with eight 2K optical image sensors. The division behind the product, Nokia Technologies, claimed that OZO would be the most advanced VR film-making platform.[76] Nokia&#39;s press release stated that OZO would be &quot;the first in a planned portfolio of digital media solutions,&quot; with more technologic products expected in the future.[77] OZO was fully unveiled on 30 November in Los Angeles. The OZO, designed for professional use, was intended for retail for US$60,000;[78] however, its price was decreased by $15,000 prior to release,[79] and is listed on its official website as $40,000.[80]
On 14 April 2015, Nokia confirmed that it was in talks with the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent regarding a potential merger.[81] The next day, Nokia officially announced that it had agreed to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for ?15.6 billion in an all-stock deal.[82] CEO Rajeev Suri felt that the purchase would give Nokia a strategic advantage in the development of 5G wireless technologies,[83][84] and the acquisition aimed to create a stronger competitor to the rival firms Ericsson and Huawei, whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. Nokia shareholders hold 66.5% of the new combined company, while Alcatel-Lucent shareholders hold 33.5%. The Bell Labs division was to be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand would be replaced by Nokia.[82][85] In October 2015, following approval of the deal by China&#39;s Ministry of Commerce, the merger awaited approval by French regulators.[86] Despite the initial intent of selling the submarine cable division separately, Alcatel-Lucent later declared that it would not.[87] The merger closed on 14 January 2016,[88] but was not complete until 3 November 2016. From the acquisition Nokia is now also the owner of the Alcatel mobile phone brand, which continues to be licensed to TCL Corporation.
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of BMW, Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group for ?2.8 billion.[89] The deal closed on 3 December 2015.[90]
On 26 April 2016, Nokia announced its intent to acquire connected health device maker Withings for US$191 million. The company was integrated into a new Digital Health unit of Nokia Technologies.[91][92]
On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile sold its Nokia-branded feature phone business to HMD Global, a new company founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn&#39;s FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017.[93][94] At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, as well as a re-imagining of Nokia&#39;s classic 3310 feature phone.[95][96] While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.
On 28 June 2016 Nokia demonstrated for the first time ever a 5G-ready network.[97] In February 2017 Nokia carried out a 5G connection in Oulu, Finland using the 5GTF standard, backed by Verizon, on Intel architecture-based equipment.[98]
On 5 July 2017, Nokia and Xiaomi announced that they have signed a business collaboration agreement and a multi-year patent agreement, including a cross license to each company&#39;s cellular standard essential patents.[99]
Nokia is a public limited-liability company listed on the Helsinki and New York stock exchanges.[4] Nokia has played a very large role in the economy of Finland,[100][101] and it is an important employer in the country, working with multiple local partners and subcontractors.[102] Nokia contributed 1.6% to Finland&#39;s GDP and accounted for about 16% of the country&#39;s exports in 2006.[103]
Nokia comprises two business groups along with further subsidiaries and affiliated firms.
Nokia Networks is Nokia Corporation&#39;s largest division. It is a multinational data networking and telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Espoo, Finland, and is the world&#39;s fourth-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, measured by 2016 revenues (after Huawei, Ericsson and Cisco). It has operations in around 150 countries.[104] Nokia Networks provides wireless and fixed network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms and professional services to operators and service providers.[105] It focuses on GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA, LTE and WiMAX radio access networks, supporting core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities and services.
The Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) brand identity was launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007 as a joint venture between Nokia (50.1%) and Siemens (49.9%),[106] although it is now wholly owned by Nokia. In July 2013, Nokia bought back all shares in Nokia Siemens Networks for a sum of US$2.21 billion and renamed it to Nokia Solutions and Networks, shortly thereafter changed to simply Nokia Networks.[107]
Nokia Technologies is a division of Nokia that develops consumer products and licenses technology including the Nokia brand.[108] Its focuses are imaging, sensing, wireless connectivity, power management and materials, and other areas such as the IP licensing program. It consists of three labs: Radio Systems Lab, in areas of radio access, wireless local connectivity and radio implementation; Media Technologies Lab, in areas of multimedia and interaction; and Sensor and Material Technologies Lab, in areas of advanced sensing solutions, interaction methods, nanotechnologies and quantum technologies. Nokia Technologies also provides public participation in its development through the Invent with Nokia program.[109] It was created in 2014 following a restructuring of Nokia Corporation.
In November 2014, Nokia Technologies launched its first product, the Nokia N1 tablet computer.[110] In July 2015, Nokia Technologies introduced a VR camera called OZO, designed for professional content creators and developed in Tampere, Finland. With its 8 synchronized shutter sensors and 8 microphones, the product can capture stereoscopic 3D video and spatial audio.[111][112] On 31 May 2016, the Digital Health unit was founded. It is led by Cdric Hutchings, former CEO of Withings, which Nokia acquired.[113]
On 31 August 2016, Ramzi Haidamus announced he would be stepping down from his position as president of Nokia Technologies.[114] Brad Rodrigues, previously head of strategy and business development, assumed the role of interim president.[115] On 30 June 2017, Gregory Lee, previously CEO of Samsung Electronics in North America, was appointed Nokia Technologies CEO and President.[116]
Nokia Bell Labs is a research and scientific development firm that was once the R&amp;D arm of the American Bell System. It became a subsidiary of Nokia Corporation after the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent in 2016.
NGP Capital (formerly Nokia Growth Partners) is a global venture capital firm, focusing in investments on growth stage &quot;Internet of things&quot; (IoT) and mobile technology companies.[117] NGP holds investments throughout the U.S., Europe, China and India. Their portfolio consists of companies in mobile technology including the sectors Connected Enterprise, Digital Health, Consumer IoT and Connected Car. Following a $350 million funding for IoT companies in 2016, NGP manages $1 billion worth of assets.[118]
Nokia had previously promoted innovation through venture sponsorships dating back to 1998 with Nokia Venture Partners, which was renamed BlueRun Ventures and spun off in 2005.[119] Nokia Growth Partners (NGP) was founded in 2005 as a growth stage venture fund as a continuation of the early successes of Nokia Venture Partners. In 2017, the company renamed Nokia Growth Partners to NGP Capital.[120]
NGP&#39;s largest exits include GanJi, UCWeb, Whistle, Rocket Fuel, Swype, Summit Microelectronics and Netmagic.
Nuage Networks is a venture providing software-defined networking (SDN) solutions. It was formed by Alcatel-Lucent in 2013 to develop a software overlay for automating and orchestrating hybrid clouds.[121] It has been part of Nokia following their acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent in 2016.[122] Throughout 2017 Nuage sealed deals with Vodafone and Telefonica to provide its SD-WAN architecture to their servers.[123][124] BT had already been a client since 2016.[125] A deal with China Mobile in January 2017 also used Nuage&#39;s SDN technology for 2,000 public cloud servers at existing data centers in China,[126] and another in October 2017 with China Pacific Insurance Company.[127]
The company is based in Mountain View, California and the CEO is Sunil Khandekar.[128]
Alcatel Mobile is a mobile phone brand owned by Nokia since 2016. It has been licensed since 2005 to Chinese company TCL when it was under the ownership of Alcatel (later Alcatel-Lucent) in a contract until 2024.
HMD Global is a mobile phone vendor based at the same building as Nokia&#39;s headquarters in Espoo, Finland. It was set up by former Nokia employees and introduced Nokia-branded Android-based devices to the market in 2017. Nokia has no investment in the company but retains some input in the development of its devices. Nokia has focused on telecommunications networking since selling its mobile phone business to Microsoft in 2014.[129]
The control and management of Nokia is divided among the shareholders at a general meeting and the Nokia Leadership Team (left),[130] under the direction of the board of directors (right).[131] The chairman and the rest of the Nokia Leadership Team members are appointed by the board of directors. Only the Chairman of the Nokia Leadership Team can belong to both the board of directors and the Nokia Leadership Team. The board of directors&#39; committees consist of the Audit Committee,[132] the Personnel Committee,[133] and the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee.[134][135]
The operations of the company are managed within the framework set by the Finnish Companies Act,[136] Nokia&#39;s Articles of Association,[137] and Corporate Governance Guidelines,[138] supplemented by the board of directors&#39; adopted charters.

Nokia is a public limited liability company and is the oldest company listed under the same name on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, beginning in 1915.[140] Nokia has had a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994.[4][140] Nokia shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2003, the Paris Stock Exchange in 2004, the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2007 and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2012.[141] Due to the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent in 2015, Nokia listed its shares again on the Paris Stock Exchange and was included in the CAC 40 index on 6 January 2016.[142]
In 2007, Nokia had a market capitalization of ?110 billion; by 17 July 2012 this had fallen to ?6.28 billion, and by 23 February 2015, it increased to ?26.07 billion.
Nokia&#39;s official corporate culture manifesto, The Nokia Way, emphasizes the speed and flexibility of decision-making in a flat, networked organization.[143]
The official business language of Nokia is English. All documentation is written in English, and is used in official intra-company communication.
In May 2007, Nokia redefined its values after initiating a series of discussion across its worldwide branches regarding what the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: Engaging You, Achieving Together, Passion for Innovation and Very Human.[143]
In August 2014, Nokia redefined its values again after the sale of its Devices business. The new values were defined with the key words respect, achievement, renewal and challenge.
The Nokia House was the head office building of Nokia Corporation, located in Keilaniemi, Espoo. The two southernmost parts of the building were built in the early 1990s and the third, northernmost part was built in 2000.
In December 2012, Nokia announced that it had sold its head office building to Finland-based Exilion for ?170 million and was leasing it back on a long term basis.[144] Nokia left the building as part of the sale of the mobile phone business to Microsoft in April 2014, and the building was renamed to Microsoft Talo.[145] Nokia moved its headquarters to Karaportti in Espoo, which was previously the headquarters of NSN (now Nokia Networks).[146]
In 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG, reportedly provided Iran&#39;s monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.[152] The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use deep packet inspection to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology &quot;enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes&quot;.[153]
During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran&#39;s Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to use of deep packet inspection.[154]
In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging.[155]
Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a &quot;lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls&quot; and that it &quot;has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran&quot;.[156]
In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees&#39; electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.[157] Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed.[158] The Finnish media dubbed the law Lex Nokia because it was implemented as a result of Nokia&#39;s pressure.
The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of H?meenlinna had recently given the required notice.[159]
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[160] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple&#39;s General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, &quot;Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours.&quot; This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in &quot;virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers&quot;.[161] Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the iPhone, Macintosh and iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.[160]
In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[162] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[163][164]
Nokia&#39;s Indian subsidiary has been charged with non-payment of TDS and transgressing transfer pricing norms in India.[165] The unpaid TDS of ?30?billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company.[166]</div></div><div class="card" data-v-aa9ccaee><div class="question" data-v-aa9ccaee>What is the meaning of novus ordo seclorum?</div><div class="separator" data-v-aa9ccaee></div><div class="answer" data-v-aa9ccaee>&quot;New order of the ages&quot;ðŸš¨The phrase Novus ordo seclorum (Latin for &quot;New order of the ages&quot;; English:  /?no?v?s ???rdo? s??kl??r?m/; Latin pronunciation:?[?novus ?ordo se?klorum]) is the second of two mottos that appear on the reverse (or back side) of the Great Seal of the United States. (The first motto is Annuit c?ptis, literally translated &quot;[He/she/it] has favored our undertakings&quot;.) The Great Seal was first designed in 1782, and has been printed on the back of the United States one-dollar bill since 1935. The phrase  Novus ordo seclorum is sometimes mistranslated as &quot;New World Order&quot; by people who believe in a conspiracy behind the design.[1]

The phrase is a reference to the fourth Eclogue of Virgil,[1] which contains a passage (lines 5-8[2])  that reads:

The forms saecla, saeclorum etc. were normal alternatives to the more common saecula etc. throughout the history of Latin poetry and prose. The form saeculorum is impossible in hexameter verse: the ae and o are long, the u short by position. For the medieval exchange between ae, ? and e, see ?; the word medieval (medi?val) itself is another example.

Medieval Christians read  Virgil&#39;s poem as a prophecy of the coming of Christ. The Augustan Age, although pre-Christian, was viewed as a golden age preparing the world for the coming of Christ. The great poets of this age were viewed as a source of revelation and light upon the Christian mysteries to come.[3]

The word seclorum does not mean &quot;secular&quot;, as one might assume, but is the genitive (possessive) plural form of the word saeculum, meaning (in this context) generation, century, or age. Saeculum did come to mean &quot;age, world&quot; in late, Christian Latin, and &quot;secular&quot; is derived from it, through secularis. However,  the adjective &quot;secularis,&quot; meaning &quot;worldly,&quot; is not equivalent to the genitive plural &quot;seclorum,&quot; meaning &quot;of the ages.&quot;[4]

Thus the motto Novus ordo seclorum can be translated as &quot;A new order of the ages.&quot; It was proposed by Charles Thomson, the Latin expert who was involved in the design of the Great Seal of the United States, to signify &quot;the beginning of the new American Era&quot; as of the date of the Declaration of Independence.[1][5]</div></div><div class="card" data-v-aa9ccaee><div class="question" data-v-aa9ccaee>When was the light house of alexandria built?</div><div class="separator" data-v-aa9ccaee></div><div class="answer" data-v-aa9ccaee>between 280 and 247 BCðŸš¨The Lighthouse of Alexandria, sometimes called the Pharos of Alexandria (/?f??r?s/; Ancient Greek: ? ?? ?? ?Ï«Ñ´Ïš?Ï«?, contemporary Koine Greek pronunciation:?[ho p?.ros te?s a.lek.sandr?a?s]), was a lighthouse built by the Ptolemaic Kingdom between 280 and 247 BC which has been estimated to be 100 metres in overall height.[1] One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, for many centuries it was one of the tallest man-made structures in the world. Badly damaged by three earthquakes between AD 956 and 1323, it then became an abandoned ruin. It was the third longest surviving ancient wonder (after the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and the extant Great Pyramid of Giza) until 1480, when the last of its remnant stones were used to build the Citadel of Qaitbay on the site. In 1994, French archaeologists discovered some remains of the lighthouse on the floor of Alexandria&#39;s Eastern Harbour.[2] The Ministry of State of Antiquities in Egypt has planned, as of late 2015, to turn submerged ruins of ancient Alexandria, including those of the Pharos, into an underwater museum.[3]


Pharos was a small island located on the western edge of the Nile Delta. In 332 BC Alexander the Great founded the city of Alexandria on an isthmus opposite Pharos. Alexandria and Pharos were later connected by a mole[4] spanning more than 1200 metres (.75?mi), which was called the Heptastadion (&quot;seven stadia&quot;a stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180?m). The east side of the mole became the Great Harbour, now an open bay; on the west side lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbour. Today&#39;s city development lying between the present Grand Square and the modern Ras el-Tin quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole, and the Ras el-Tin promontory represents all that is left of the island of Pharos,[5] the site of the lighthouse at its eastern point having been weathered away by the sea.
The lighthouse was constructed in the 3rd century BC. After Alexander the Great died, the first Ptolemy (Ptolemy I Soter) announced himself king in 305 BC, and commissioned its construction shortly thereafter. The building was finished during the reign of his son, the second Ptolemy (Ptolemy II Philadelphus). It took twelve years to complete, at a total cost of 800?talents,[6] and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top, and the tower was said to have been built mostly with solid blocks of limestone.
Strabo reported that Sostratus had a dedication inscribed in metal letters to the &quot;Saviour Gods&quot;. Later Pliny the Elder wrote that Sostratus was the architect, which is disputed.[7] In the second century AD the satirist Lucian wrote that Sostratus inscribed his name under plaster bearing the name of Ptolemy. This was so that when the plaster with Ptolemy&#39;s name fell off, Sostratus&#39;s name would be visible in the stone.[8][9]
Judith McKenzie writes that &quot;The Arab descriptions of the lighthouse are remarkably consistent, although it was repaired several times especially after earthquake damage. The height they give varies only fifteen per cent from c.?103 to 118?m (338 to 387?ft), on a base c.?30 by 30?m (98 by 98?ft) square.&quot;[10]
The fullest description of the lighthouse comes from Arab traveller Abou Haggag Youssef Ibn Mohammed el-Balawi el-Andaloussi, who visited Alexandria in A.D.?1166.[11]
The Arab authors indicate that the lighthouse was constructed from large blocks of light-coloured stone, the tower was made up of three tapering tiers: a lower square section with a central core, a middle octagonal section, and, at the top, a circular section. At its apex was positioned a mirror which reflected sunlight during the day; a fire was lit at night. Extant Roman coins struck by the Alexandrian mint show that a statue of a Triton was positioned on each of the building&#39;s four corners. A statue of Poseidon or Zeus stood atop the lighthouse.[12] The Pharos&#39;s masonry blocks were interlocked, sealed together using molten lead, to withstand the pounding of the waves.[13]
Al-Masudi writes that the seaward-facing eastern side featured an inscription dedicated to Zeus.[14]
The lighthouse was badly damaged in the earthquake of 956, and then again in 1303 and 1323. Finally the stubby remnant disappeared in 1480, when the then-Sultan of Egypt, Qaitbay, built a medieval fort on the larger platform of the lighthouse site using some of the fallen stone.
The 10th-century writer al-Mas&#39;udi reports a legendary tale on the lighthouse&#39;s destruction, according to which at the time of Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (r.?705Ã¿715) the Byzantines sent a eunuch agent, who adopted Islam, gained the Caliph&#39;s confidence, and secured permission to search for hidden treasure at the base of the lighthouse. The search was cunningly made in such a manner that the foundations were undermined, and the Pharos collapsed. The agent managed to escape in a ship waiting for him.[15]
In 1968 the lighthouse was rediscovered. UNESCO sponsored an expedition to send a team of marine archaeologists, led by Honor Frost, to the site. She confirmed the existence of the ruins representing part of the lighthouse. Due to the lack of specialized archaeologists and the area becoming a military zone, exploration was put on hold.[16]
Greek archaeologists led by Jean-Yves Empereur re-discovered the physical remains of the lighthouse in late 1994 on the floor of Alexandria&#39;s Eastern Harbour. Some of these remains were brought up and were lying at the harbour on public view at the end of 1995. [2] Subsequent satellite imaging has revealed further remains. It is possible to go diving and see the ruins. The secretariat of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage are currently working with the Government of Egypt on an initiative to add the Bay of Alexandria (to include remains of the lighthouse) on a World Heritage List of submerged cultural sites.[17]
Legend has it that the people of the island of Pharos were wreckers; hence, Ptolemy I had the lighthouse built to help guide ships into port at night.[18]
Pharos became the etymological origin of the word &quot;lighthouse&quot; in Greek (??), Persian (Fns Ã¿ ?????), many Romance languages such as French (phare), Italian and Spanish (faro), Romanian (far) and Portuguese (farol), and even some Slavic languages like Bulgarian (far). In Russian, a derived word means &quot;headlight&quot; (fara Ã¿ ).
In 2008 it was suggested[19] that the Pharos was the vertical yardstick used in the first precise measurement of the size of the earth.
Since 1978 a number of proposals have been made to replace the lighthouse with a modern reconstruction. In 2015, the Egyptian government and the Alexandria governorate suggested building a skyscraper on the site of the lighthouse as part of the regeneration of the eastern harbour of Alexandria Port. The plan was opposed by Alexandria-based sociologist Amro Ali.[20]
The lighthouse remains a civic symbol of the city of Alexandria and of the Alexandria Governorate with which the city is more or less coterminous. A stylised representation of the lighthouse appears on the flag and seal of the Governorate and on many public services of the city, including the seal of Alexandria University.
Now because of the narrowness of the strait there can be no access by ship to the harbour without the consent of those who hold the Pharos. In view of this, Caesar took the precaution of landing his troops while the enemy was preoccupied with fighting, seized the Pharos and posted a garrison there. The result was that safe access was secured for his corn supplies and reinforcements.[23]
&quot;After he [Sostratus] had built the work he wrote his name on the masonry inside, covered it with gypsum, and having hidden it inscribed the name of the reigning king. He knew, as actually happened, that in a very short time the letters would fall away with the plaster and there would be revealed: &#39;Sostratus of Cnidos, the son of Dexiphanes, to the Divine Saviours, for the sake of them that sail at sea.&#39; Thus, not even he had regard for the immediate moment or his own brief life-time: he looked to our day and eternity, as long as the tower shall stand and his skill abide. History then should be written in that spirit, with truthfulness and an eye to future expectations rather than with adulation and a view to the pleasure of present praise.&quot;</div></div><div class="card" data-v-aa9ccaee><div class="question" data-v-aa9ccaee>When did the japanese river otter become extinct?</div><div class="separator" data-v-aa9ccaee></div><div class="answer" data-v-aa9ccaee>August 28, 2012ðŸš¨



Lutra nippon Suzuki,?1996

The Japanese river otter (Lutra lutra whiteleyi) (?YH, Nihon-kawauso[1]) is an extinct variety of otter formerly widespread in Japan. Dating back to the 1880s, it was even seen in Tokyo. The population suddenly shrank in the 1930s, and the mammal nearly vanished. Since then, it has only been spotted several times, in 1964 in the Seto Inland Sea, and in the Uwa Sea in 1972 and 1973. The last official sighting was in the southern part of Kchi Prefecture in 1979, when it was photographed in the mouth of the Shinjo River in Susaki. It was subsequently classified as a &quot;Critically Endangered&quot; species on the Japanese Red List.[2] On August 28, 2012, the Japanese river otter was officially declared extinct by the Ministry of the Environment.[3][4] It is the official animal symbol of Ehime Prefecture.[5] In February 2017, a wild otter was caught on camera on Tsushima Island, Nagasaki Prefecture. However, it is not known whether the observed otter was a Japanese river otter.[6]

Several genetic studies have suggested that the Japanese river otter should be treated as a distinct species Lutra nippon rather than a subspecies of Lutra lutra.[7] However, this reclassification is not yet generally accepted in the absence of further verification.[8]

Fully grown, a Japanese otter was between 65 and 80?cm (25.5 and 31.5?in) long, with a tail measuring 45 to 50?cm (17.5 to 19.5?in). It had a thick, lush coat of dark brown fur with short webbed feet. In addition the river otter has two types/sets of fur. Data has shown that the river otter would shed their under fur fully from May to August. After the shedding of the under fur, the otter shed their guard hair from August to November. This allowed them to adjust to the seasons changing.[9] The otter had a lifespan of up to 25 years.[5]

A nocturnal creature, an otter only left its den after dark to forage for food. Claiming a territory about ten miles in diameter, it marked the area with its droppings about one to three miles apart and sets up three or four nests under rocks or inside bushes. The otters were always on the move, visiting each den only once every three to four days. They were considered an adult after only one year. They would then venture on their own, but continue in solitude unless ready to mate.[10]

In general, the Japanese River Otter was ready to reproduce when they were two to three years old. In addition, the males sought out the females in the reproduction process. Besides during reproduction and with the exception of young males staying with their mother for a range of two to three years until they were mature, female otters and male otters didn&#39;t generally live together. When a male otter calls out to a female otter, she must give him permission for the mating. If she does not, the male would move onto the next female otter. For the male to know that the female is interested in mating, the female will roll around with the male, which releases hormones. The Japanese River Otter could have anywhere from one to six offspring per litter. Once born, the baby otters are completely blind for a month, leaving them utterly helpless. The female otter makes for a great mother; nursing her young for up to eight hours a day, as well as teaching them valuable lessons and protecting them. After the pups are around the age of four months, the mother otter will introduce her youth to solid food and start to teach them how to hunt.[11]

Like most otters, the Japanese river otter was not an especially picky eater. While it primarily fed on fish, crab, and shrimp; it also ate eels, beetles, watermelons, and sweet potatoes. Many of these Japanese otters eat about 15% to 25% of their own body weight. Many otters spend around six hours to find food because of their difficult living space and their competition for food. The Japanese otter was known as one of the top carnivores in the aquatic food chain.

In the past, there were thousands of river otters in Japan. Starting in the Meiji period, the government of Japan adopted a policy of increasing wealth and military prowess. Animal pelts thus became very valuable since they could be exported for money. As a result, Japanese river otters started to be hunted throughout the country. Their numbers soon dwindled. Populations made a slight comeback after the creation of hunting regulations.[12] Even so, pollution and human development then harmed their environment and resources to build their habitats. This pollution terminated their food sources in the rivers, causing them to hunt in more dangerous settings.[10] These causes grew rapidly, resulting in the extinction of the Japanese river otter in the late 20th century.[13]

Throughout the 1990s, there were several attempts to locate a surviving Japanese river otter.

In December 1991, the Environmental Agency of Japan in partnership with the Kochi prefectural government assembled a research team of experts and began their search. In March 1992, the research group found hair and excrement in Kochi Prefecture and believed to have come from an otter. Also found were three footprints, and ten additional excrement samples. After an analysis of a cross-section of the hair, the researchers determined that it came from an otter. An official from the agency&#39;s wildlife protection section stated that the hair was &quot;scientifically solid evidence that confirms the existence of the Japanese Otter.&quot;

In 1994, zoological experts visited the area where the excrement was found. They discovered remains of the animal&#39;s urine, which the animal is believed to leave during its courtship. The prefectural government of Kochi set up an infrared camera for six months from October 1994 to April 1995 in an effort to capture it on film, but all that was recorded were animals such as raccoon dogs.

Between March 4 and 9, 1996, a group of zoo officials, municipal government officials and animals lovers from across the country searched for the river otter in the areas where finds have been made in the past. Such areas included coastal areas in Susaki, areas along the Niyodo River running through Sakawacho and Inocho, and coastal areas along Shimanto River. No evidence of the animal&#39;s existence was found.

Among these, the presumed sighting reported in Kochi by a local artist with a detailed sketch was regarded &quot;highly trustable&quot; by Yoshihiko Machida, an emeritus professor at the Kchi University in 2009.[14] Dr. Machida also pointed that the previous studies by the prefecture had been restricted only among coastal areas and thus not filling the definition of extinct species by IUCN. Regarding this, a survey was conducted by Ehime Prefecture in 2014, noting several recent sightings.[15]

In February 2017, a wild otter was filmed alive on Tsushima Island in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. However, it is not known whether the observed otter was a Japanese river otter.[16]

Research done in the early 1990s by the Department of Biology of Kochi University in Japan revealed some interesting facts about the genes of the Japanese River Otter. For many years, it was thought that the Japanese river otter was a subspecies of the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra. However, the studies done in Kochi University revealed something different. By comparing the Mitochondrial Cytochrome b Gene of a mummified Japanese river otter corpse with Eurasian otters from Latvia and China, it was proven that the Japanese river otter was actually different, and was therefore not a subspecies. The name for the Japanese river otter was then changed from L. l. whiteleyi to Lutra nippon.[7]

The Japanese river otter was used as medicine to help cure tuberculosis. Typically a dosage that would last about forty days would cost roughly three hundred US dollars.[17]
Beginning in the early 20th century, the otter pelts were used for military purposes as well. In 1929, the government established the &quot;Hunters Association&quot; which called upon people to hunt and skin these otters, which was one of the main causes of their eventual extinction.[17]

The Japanese river otter was named the official animal symbol of Japan&#39;s Ehime Prefecture, a region of Japan in northwestern Shikoku.[5]</div></div><div class="card" data-v-aa9ccaee><div class="question" data-v-aa9ccaee>What is the most famous fountain in rome?</div><div class="separator" data-v-aa9ccaee></div><div class="answer" data-v-aa9ccaee>Trevi FountainðŸš¨

The Trevi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi) is a fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini. Standing 26.3 metres (86?ft) high and 49.15 metres (161.3?ft) wide,[1] it is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world. The fountain has appeared in several notable films, including Federico Fellini&#39;s La Dolce Vita, the eponymous Three Coins in the Fountain, The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and Roman Holiday.[2]

The fountain at the junction of three roads (tre vie)[3] marks the terminal point[4] of the &quot;modern&quot; Acqua Vergine, the revived Aqua Virgo, one of the aqueducts that supplied water to ancient Rome. In 19 BC, supposedly with the help of a virgin, Roman technicians located a source of pure water some 13?km (8.1?mi) from the city. (This scene is presented on the present fountain&#39;s fa?ade.) However, the eventual indirect route of the aqueduct made its length some 22?km (14?mi). This Aqua Virgo led the water into the Baths of Agrippa. It served Rome for more than 400 years.[5]

In 1629 Pope Urban VIII, finding the earlier fountain insufficiently dramatic, asked Gian Lorenzo Bernini to sketch possible renovations, but the project was abandoned when the pope died. Though Bernini&#39;s project was never constructed, there are many Bernini touches in the fountain as it exists today. An early, influential model by Pietro da Cortona, preserved in the Albertina, Vienna, also exists, as do various early 18th century sketches, most unsigned, as well as a project attributed to Nicola Michetti[6] one attributed to Ferdinando Fuga[7] and a French design by Edm Bouchardon.[8]

Competitions had become popular during the Baroque era to design buildings, fountains, as well as the Spanish Steps. In 1730 Pope Clement XII organized a contest in which Nicola Salvi initially lost to Alessandro Galilei?Ã¿ but due to the outcry in Rome over a Florentine having won, Salvi was awarded the commission anyway.[9] Work began in 1732.

Salvi died in 1751 with his work half finished, but he had made sure a barber&#39;s unsightly sign would not spoil the ensemble, hiding it behind a sculpted vase,[10] called by Romans the asso di coppe, the &quot;Ace of Cups&quot;, because of its resemblance to a Tarot card.[11] Four different sculptors were hired to complete the fountain&#39;s decorations: Pietro Bracci (whose statue of Oceanus sits in the central niche), Filippo della Valle, Giovanni Grossi, and Andrea Bergondi.[12] Giuseppe Pannini was hired as architect.[13]

The Trevi Fountain was finished in 1762 by Pannini, who substituted the present allegories for planned sculptures of Agrippa and Trivia, the Roman virgin.[14] It was officially opened and inaugurated on May 22 by Pope Clement XIII.[15]

The majority of the piece is made from Travertine stone, quarried near Tivoli, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) east of Rome.[16]

The fountain was refurbished once in 1988 to remove discoloration caused by smog,[17] and again in 1998; the stonework was scrubbed and all cracks and other areas of deterioration were repaired by skilled artisans, and the fountain was equipped with recirculating pumps.[18]

In January 2013, it was announced that the Italian fashion company Fendi would sponsor a 20-month, 2.2-million-euro restoration of the fountain; it was to be the most thorough restoration in the fountain&#39;s history.[19]

Restoration work began in June 2014 and was completed in November 2015. The fountain was reopened with an official ceremony on the evening of November 3, 2015. The restoration included the installation of more than 100 LED lights to improve the nighttime illumination of the fountain.[20][21][22]

The backdrop for the fountain is the Palazzo Poli, given a new fa?ade with a giant order of Corinthian pilasters that link the two main stories.[23] Taming of the waters is the theme of the gigantic scheme that tumbles forward, mixing water and rockwork, and filling the small square. Tritons guide Oceanus&#39; shell chariot, taming hippocamps.[24]

In the centre a robustly-modelled triumphal arch is superimposed on the palazzo fa?ade. The centre niche or exedra framing Oceanus has free-standing columns for maximal light and shade. In the niches flanking Oceanus, Abundance spills water from her urn and Salubrity holds a cup from which a snake drinks. Above, bas reliefs illustrate the Roman origin of the aqueducts.[25]

The Tritons and horses provide symmetrical balance, with the maximum contrast in their mood and poses[citation needed] (by 1730, rococo was already in full bloom in France and Germany).

Coins are purportedly meant to be thrown using the right hand over the left shoulder.[26] This was the theme of 1954&#39;s Three Coins in the Fountain and the Academy Award-winning song by that name which introduced the picture.

An estimated 3,000 euros are thrown into the fountain each day.[27] In 2016, an estimated ?1.4 million (US$1.5 million) was thrown into the fountain.[28] The money has been used to subsidize a supermarket for Rome&#39;s needy;[27] however, there are regular attempts to steal coins from the fountain, even though it is illegal to do so.[27][29][30]

Most critical organs are housed within the torso. In the upper chest, the heart and lungs are protected by the rib cage, and the abdomen contains most of the organs responsible for digestion: the stomach, which breaks down partially digested food via gastric acid; the liver, which respectively produces bile necessary for digestion; the large and small intestines, which extract nutrients from food; the anus, from which fecal wastes are egested; the rectum, which stores feces; the gallbladder, which stores and concentrates bile; the kidneys, which produce urine, the ureters, which pass it to the bladder for storage; and the urethra, which excretes urine and in a male passes sperm through the seminal vesicles. Finally, the pelvic region houses both the male and female reproductive organs.
The torso also harbours many of the main groups of muscles in the body, including the:
The organs, muscles, and other contents of the torso are supplied by nerves, which mainly originate as nerve roots from the thoracic and lumbar parts of the spinal cord. Some organs also receive a nerve supply from the vagus nerve. The sensation to the skin is provided by:

It also includes oceanic crust extending westward to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and northward to the Gakkel Ridge.
The eastern side is a boundary with the North American Plate to the north and a boundary with the Philippine Sea Plate to the south and possibly with the Okhotsk Plate and the Amurian Plate. The southerly side is a boundary with the African Plate to the west, the Arabian Plate in the middle and the Indo-Australian Plate to the east. The westerly side is a divergent boundary with the North American Plate forming the northernmost part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is straddled by Iceland. All of the volcanic eruptions in Iceland, such as the 1973 eruption of Eldfell, the 1783 eruption of Laki, and the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj?kull, are caused by the North American and the Eurasian plates moving apart, which is a result of divergent plate boundary forces.
The geodynamics of central Asia is dominated by the interaction between the Eurasian and Indian Plates. In this area, many subplates or crust blocks have been recognized, which form the Central Asian and the East Asian transit zones.[2]</div></div><div class="card" data-v-aa9ccaee><div class="question" data-v-aa9ccaee>What is the largest city in georgia by population?</div><div class="separator" data-v-aa9ccaee></div><div class="answer" data-v-aa9ccaee>AtlantaðŸš¨Georgia is a state located in the Southern United States.

European Parliament Elections

Since the foundation of the European Communities, the United Kingdom has been an important neighbour and is currently a major member, until its withdrawal.

Research shows that the United Kingdom&#39;s membership of the European Union has contributed to higher incomes, played an important role in stopping British economic decline during the 1950s and 1960s, and has increased trade and reduced trade costs.[1][2][3][4]

The UK was not a signatory of the three original treaties that were incorporated into what was then the European Communities, including the most well known of these, the 1957 Treaty of Rome, establishing the European Economic Community (EEC). The UK&#39;s applications to join in 1963 and 1967 were vetoed by the President of France, Charles de Gaulle, who said that &quot;a number of aspects of Britain&#39;s economy, from working practices to agriculture&quot; had &quot;made Britain incompatible with Europe&quot; and that Britain harboured a &quot;deep-seated hostility&quot; to any pan-European project.[5]

Once de Gaulle had relinquished the French presidency in 1969, the UK made a third and successful application for membership. The question of sovereignty had been discussed at the time in an official Foreign and Commonwealth Office document. It listed among &quot;Areas of policy in which parliamentary freedom to legislate will be affected by entry into the European Communities&quot;: Customs duties, Agriculture, Free movement of labour, services and capital, Transport, and Social Security for migrant workers. The document concluded (paragraph 26) that it was advisable to put the considerations of influence and power before those of formal sovereignty.[6]

The Treaty of Accession was signed in January 1972 by the then prime minister Edward Heath, leader of the Conservative Party.[7] Parliament&#39;s European Communities Act 1972 was enacted on 17 October, and the UK&#39;s instrument of ratification was deposited the next day (18 October),[8] letting the United Kingdom&#39;s membership of the EC come into effect on 1 January 1973.[9]

In 1975, the United Kingdom held its first ever national referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Communities. The opposition Labour Party, led by Harold Wilson, had contested the October 1974 general election with a commitment to renegotiate Britain&#39;s terms of membership of the EC and then hold a referendum on whether to remain in the EC on the new terms.[10] All of the major political parties and the mainstream press supported continuing membership of the EC. However, there were significant divides within the ruling Labour Party; a 1975 one-day party conference voted by two to one in favour of withdrawal,[11] and seven of the 23 cabinet ministers were opposed to EC membership,[12] with Harold Wilson suspending the constitutional convention of Cabinet collective responsibility to allow those ministers to publicly campaign against the government.

On 5 June 1975, the electorate were asked to vote yes or no on the question: &quot;Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (Common Market)?&quot; Every administrative county and region in the UK returned majority &quot;Yes&quot; votes, apart from the Shetland Islands and the Outer Hebrides. With a turnout of just under 65%, the outcome of the vote was 67.2% in favour of staying in, and the United Kingdom remained a member of the EC.[13] Support for the UK to leave the EC in 1975, in the data, appears unrelated to the support for Leave in the 2016 referendum.[14]

In 1979, the United Kingdom opted out of the newly formed European Monetary System (EMS), which was the precursor to the creation of the euro currency.

The opposition Labour Party campaigned in the 1983 general election on a commitment to withdraw from the EC without a referendum.[15] It was heavily defeated; the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher was re-elected. The Labour Party subsequently changed its policy.[15]

In 1985, the United Kingdom ratified the Single European Actthe first major revision to the Treaty of Rome  without a referendum, with the full support of the Thatcher government.[citation needed]

In October 1990  despite the deep reservations of Margaret Thatcher,[citation needed] who was under pressure from her senior ministers[citation needed]  the United Kingdom joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), with the pound sterling pegged to the deutschmark.

Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister in November 1990, amid internal divisions within the Conservative Party that arose partly from her increasingly Eurosceptic views. The United Kingdom was forced to withdraw from the ERM in September 1992, after the pound sterling came under pressure from currency speculators (an episode known as Black Wednesday). The resulting cost to UK taxpayers was estimated to be in excess of S3?billion.[16][17]

As a result of the Maastricht Treaty, the European Communities became the European Union on 1 November 1993.[18] The new name reflected the evolution of the organisation from an economic union into a political union.[19] As a result of the Lisbon Treaty, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, the Maastricht Treaty is now known, in updated form as, the Treaty on European Union (2007) or TEU, and the Treaty of Rome is now known, in updated form, as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (2007) or TFEU.

The Referendum Party was formed in 1994 by Sir James Goldsmith to contest the 1997 general election on a platform of providing a referendum on the UK&#39;s membership of the EU.[20] It fielded candidates in 547 constituencies at that election, and won 810,860 votes or 2.6% of the total votes cast.[21] It failed to win a single parliamentary seat because its vote was spread out across the country, and lost its deposit (funded by Goldsmith) in 505 constituencies.[21]

The UK Independence Party (UKIP), a Eurosceptic political party, was also formed, in 1993. It achieved third place in the UK during the 2004 European elections, second place in the 2009 European elections and first place in the 2014 European elections, with 27.5% of the total vote. This was the first time since the 1910 general election that any party other than the Labour or Conservative parties had taken the largest share of the vote in a nationwide election.[22] UKIP&#39;s electoral success in the 2014 European election has been documented as the strongest correlate of the support for the leave campaign in the 2016 referendum.[23]

In 2014, UKIP won two by-elections, triggered by defecting Conservative MPs, and in the 2015 general election took 12.6% of the total vote and held one of the two seats won in 2014.[24]

The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was drafted in 1950, largely under British leadership,[citation needed] and its court (ECtHR) was established in 1953.  EU institutions are bound under article 6 of the Treaty of Nice[citation needed] to respect human rights under the Convention, over and above for example the Law of the United Kingdom.[25] The Court was criticised especially within the Conservative Party for ruling in favour of British prisoners obtaining the right to vote.[26][27][28][29]  During the referendum the then Home Secretary, Theresa May, had called for the UK to leave the ECHR[30]

In a statistical analysis published in April 2016, Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University defined Euroscepticism as the wish to sever or reduce the powers of the EU, and conversely Europhilia as the desire to preserve or increase the powers of the EU. According to this definition, the British Social Attitudes (BSA) surveys show an increase in euroscepticism from 38% (1993) to 65% (2015). Euroscepticism should however not be confused with the wish to leave the EU: the BSA survey for the period JulyÃ¿November 2015 shows that 60% backed the option &quot;continue as an EU member&quot;, and only 30% backed the option to &quot;withdraw&quot;.[31]

Since 1977, both pro- and anti-European views have had majority support at different times, with some dramatic swings between the two camps.[32] In the United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum of 1975, two-thirds of British voters favoured continued EC membership. The highest-ever rejection of membership was in 1980, the first full year of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#39;s term of office, with 65% opposed to and 26% in favour of membership.[32]

After Thatcher had negotiated a rebate of British membership payments in 1984, those favouring the EC maintained a lead in the opinion polls, except during 2000, as Prime Minister Tony Blair aimed for closer EU integration, including adoption of the euro currency, and around 2011, as immigration into the United Kingdom became increasingly noticeable.[32] As late as December 2015 there was, according to ComRes, a clear majority in favour of remaining in the EU, albeit with a warning that voter intentions would be considerably influenced by the outcome of Prime Minister David Cameron&#39;s ongoing EU reform negotiations, especially with regards to the two issues of &quot;safeguards for non-Eurozone member states&quot; and &quot;immigration&quot;.[33] The following events are relevant.

From 2017 to 2019, UK has engaged in negotiating a Brexit between the European Union and herself. Between UK and EU, this Brexit would consist in a withdrawal agreement and a trade agreement, while at a global level this would/might also split various FTA. The withdrawal agreement would focus on the citizens, the financial settlement, and the question of Ireland.
